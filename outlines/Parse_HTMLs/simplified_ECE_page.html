<p><strong>Notes for students self-isolating with Covid-like symptoms or declaring short-term or religious/creed related absences: </strong>Course materials are regularly posted on LEARN. TAs/instructors are available to answer questions posted on Piazza. There are remote Q&amp;As for labs by the lab instructor and TAs. Students can also remotely access the office hours by the course instructor and the tutorial TAs for Q&amp;As related to lectures and tutorials, respectively. If a Covid-like symptom related isolation or a religious/creed related absence period includes any in-person </p><ul><li>Lab demo: A deferred demo will be offered. Note that self-declared short-term absences do not apply to in-person LABs.</li><li>Midterm:  The weight of the midterm will be transferred to the final and no deferred midterm will be offered.</li><li>Final: Self-declared short-term absences do not apply to the Final Exam Period. For other absences approved by the university, a deferred final will be offered.</li></ul><p>The above arrangements are subject to adjustment. See the QUEST <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">site</a> on how to self-declare illness, isolation, and short-term and religious/creed related absences.</p><p><strong>Course-wide contingencies: </strong>Should a public health situation makes the university to cancel in-person classes and direct instructors to pivot to remote teaching, the following changes, as applicable, will be made. Note that these alternative arrangements are subject to adjustment.</p><ul><li><strong>Short-term (e.g., one-week) cancellation: </strong>In-person lectures, office hours, tutorials and lab presentations affected by any short-term cancellations will be offered remotely. Affected in-person lab quizzes will be conducted remotely.

The weights on these remote exams will remain the same as those stated earlier for the case of in-person (see weight distribution tables under Student Assessment).</li></ul><p><strong>Use of GenAI and ECE 124. </strong>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as<strong> </strong>FPGA design coding with VHDL or Verilog Hardware description languages. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this course. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.). </p><p>Students should be prepared to show their work. To demonstrate their learning, students should keep their rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. Students may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, students may be asked to meet with their instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being their original work. Through this process, if students have not sufficiently supported their work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, students should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
