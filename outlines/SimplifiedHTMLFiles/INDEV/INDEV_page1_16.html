<h2>
  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>Activities for this course involve recording, in partial fulfillment of the course learning outcomes.  You will receive notification of recording via at least one of the following mechanisms: within the Learning Management System (LEARN), a message from your course instructor, course syllabus/website, or other means. Some technologies may also provide a recording indicator. Images, audio, text/chat messaging that have been recorded may be used and/or made available by the University to students in the class for the purpose of learning. Recordings will be managed according to the University records classification scheme, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/records-management/records-classification-and-retention-schedules"><u>WatClass</u></a>, and will be securely destroyed when no longer needed by the University. Your personal information is protected in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31"><u>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</u></a>, as well as <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/privacy/"><u>University policies and guidelines</u></a> and may be subject to disclosure where required by law.</p><p>The University will use reasonable means to protect the security and confidentiality of the recorded information, but cannot provide a guarantee of such due to factors beyond the University’s control, such as recordings being forwarded, copied, intercepted, circulated, disclosed, or stored without the University’s knowledge or permission or the introduction of malware into computer system which could potentially damage or disrupt the computer, networks, and security settings. The University is not responsible for connectivity/technical difficulties or loss of data associated with your hardware, software or Internet connection.</p><p>By engaging in course activities that involve recording, you are consenting to the use of your appearance, image, text/chat messaging, and voice and/or likeness in the manner and under the conditions specified herein. (In the case of a live stream event, if you choose not to have your image or audio recorded, you may <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-it-services/"><u>disable the audio and video functionality</u></a>. Instructions to participate using a pseudonym instead of your real name are included where the feature exists; however, you must disclose the pseudonym to your instructor in advance in order to facilitate class participation.) If you choose not to be recorded, this notice serves as confirmation of your understanding that you must contact the instructor to make alternate arrangements.</p><p>You are not permitted to disclose the link to/URL of an event or an event session recording or copies of recording to anyone, for any reason. Recordings are available only to authorized individuals who have been directly provided the above instructions/link for their use. Recordings for personal use, required to facilitate your learning and preparation of personal course/lecture notes, should not be shared with others without the permission of the instructor or event coordinator. Review the University’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>guidelines for faculty, staff and students entering relationships with external organizations offering access to course materials</u></a> for more information on your obligations with respect to keeping copies of course materials.

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p><strong>Guiding Principles:</strong> I consider the classroom to be a place where we all will be treated with respect. I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability – and other visible and nonvisible differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class. </p><p><strong>Email Policy:</strong> Email is the best way to get in touch with the instructor. When sending an email, remember the following: </p><ol><li>Emails should be sent from your official University of Waterloo email account.</li><li>Put [INDEV 606] in the email subject line followed by a brief description of the email subject. For example, “[INDEV 606] Case 1”.</li><li>Sign your email with your first and last name and your student number.</li><li>Emails should contain professional and respectful language.</li><li>While we will do our best to respond to your emails as soon as possible, allow 24 to 48 hours (excluding weekends and holidays) for a response to your email. Please note questions sent less than two days before a due date may not be answered.</li></ol><p><strong>LEARN: </strong>Course slides and other course materials will be posted on LEARN. Students are allowed and encouraged to download materials for their own personal use but are not authorized to share the course materials or post the course materials on other sites. Synchronous activities will also be run through LEARN. </p><p><strong>Re-marking Policy: </strong>If any student feels that their assessment is not marked properly, they must inform the instructor within one week of the date on which the grades are posted on LEARN. Please be advised that the re-marking process can result in the grade improving, remaining unchanged, or decreasing.</p><p><strong>Missed Deliverables:</strong> Missed and late deliverables will receive a grade of 0. If you require an academic accommodation, please see the "Illness and other absences requiring academic considerations" section below.</p><p><strong>Religious Holidays: </strong>Students have the right to practice the religion of their choice. If you need to miss class to observe a religious holiday, please submit the dates of absence to the instructor by the end of the second full week of classes. The instructor will work with you to develop a mutually agreeable plan to make-up for missed class time and course work. </p><p><strong>Snow Days: </strong>In the event of severe weather that necessitates the closure of the University of Waterloo physical campus, lectures and tutorials will be delivered in an online format through Microsoft Teams. This would be announced on LEARN as soon as possible. </p><p><strong>COVID-19 Considerations: </strong>There could be a need to make alternate arrangements for in-person course activities. This alternate arrangement could be for a short period of time (e.g., one week) or a more sustained disruption to in-person course activities. In the event of a disruption, all in-person lectures and tutorials will revert to synchronous, online lectures and tutorials. </p><p>Impacted in-person deliverables will be handled on a case-by-case basis with notification provided as soon as possible (see COVID-19-Related Absences and Short-Term Absences below). </p><p>If you are unable to attend an in-person course activity due to emergency self-isolation, please let Professor Ma know as soon as possible. If this will impact more than one course, you are encouraged to inform your SEED graduate advisor. They will review your case and coordinate a reasonable and fair plan in consultation with appropriate others. </p><p>Please also see ‘Fair Contingencies for Remote Teaching’ below and ‘Illness and other absences requiring academic considerations’ in the next section. </p><p><strong>COVID-19-Related Absences and Short-Term Absences: </strong>If you declare a COVID-19-related two-day absence or short-term two (2) day absence and you will miss a graded component in INDEV 606, you need to reach out to Professor Jessie Ma as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Fair Contingencies for Remote Teaching: </strong>The course outline presents the instructor’s intentions for course assessments, their weights, and due dates in Winter 2025. As best as possible, we will keep to the specified assessments, weights, and dates. To provide contingency for unforeseen circumstances, the instructor reserves the right to modify course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines with due and fair notice to students. In the event of such challenges, the instructor will work with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty. </p><p><strong>Laptops, Tablets, and Electronic Devices: </strong>If you wish to use a laptop, tablet computer, or other electronic device during lecture, ensure that your screen is only displaying relevant course content. This will minimize the disturbance and distraction of your device to those around you. Students using electronic devices for non-course-related activities will be asked to put the devices away.</p><p><strong>Generative AI: </strong>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office</p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Writing and Communication Centre: </strong>The Writing and Communication Centre works with students in all Faculties to help you consider your audience, clarify your ideas, develop your voice, and write in the style appropriate to your discipline. We offer one-on-one support for writing papers, delivering presentations, integrating research, and revising for clarity and coherence.

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions.
