<p>The Individual Discussion Forum Posts and the Team Projects are available on the uWaterloo LEARN course website.<br/><br/><strong>Class Teamwork Participation, Attendance, and Peer Assessment</strong><br/><br/>The purpose of class participation is threefold.  First, it provides an incentive for you to come to class prepared.  Students who prepare consistently throughout the term, rather than “cramming” tend to do better on midterms, finals, and other exams.  Second, you have chosen a career where verbally expressing you views, ideas and concerns will be important to your long-term success.  Participating in the classroom with your team members and interaction with the instructor and TA’s is a great way to hone this skill.  Third, classroom and team project discussions are much more interesting when students contribute.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that one or two peer assessments will be completed during the course. The first is a formative assessment at the half way point of the course intended to provide interim feedback. The final summative assessment at the end of the term counts for a portion of the total course grade. The peer assessment is a reflection of your team’s perception of how the student contributed to the team based learning activities in the lectures/tutorials and the Team Projects. All team members will receive the same grade for a submitted Team Project, however, an individual student’s grade for your Team Projects will be reduced accordingly based upon a negative peer evaluation by the majority of the team members, or if it determined that you did not contribute in any meaningful way to the Team Project.<br/><br/><strong>Course Individual Discussion Forum Posts</strong>:<br/><br/>Students will be placed into groups for the Graded Discussion Forum Boards during the term. Discussion Board prompts will be posted to LEARN and students will be required to (1) make one original post in response to the prompt, and (2) reply to one of their group member’s posts to either build on their thoughts or post a rebuttal explaining another point of view. Further information regarding the Group Discussion Boards will be posted to LEARN. Individuals are expected to read the assigned material and be prepared to fully contribute to their individual discussion forum post. Students are NOT allowed to edit their original post, it must remain on the discussion forum in its original form. Any student that edits their original post will be deducted grades for that particular discussion forum post.<br/><br/>All individual assignments must be the exclusive work of the individual student.<br/><br/><strong>Course Team Projects/Assignments</strong>:<br/><br/>There are regular team projects/assignments. Each team assignment will be prepared in groups according to the specified team project schedule and submission requirements as posted in LEARN. The materials for each team assignment will be posted on LEARN prior to the assignment date. Team members are expected to read the assigned material and come to class (group meetings) prepared to fully contribute to their team’s work. Teams will be assigned by your professor and you may have the opportunity to work with different team members on each group assignment.<br/><br/>Team based learning (TBL) is an instructional method that puts students into roles of greater autonomy and responsibility for their learning. In pre-school, students learn the basics of how to work well with others. In business school and the workforce, this lesson becomes a mantra for successful business student candidates. Team assignments are an integral part of the curriculum for many business programs. Learning to work in small groups can pay off when it's time to look for a job and collaborate with others in the workforce. Employers want students who know how to be team players.  <br/><br/>After graduation, students may find themselves in a work environment that requires a group effort to achieve common goals. For instance, figuring out how to launch a product in a new market is just one example. Or, business managers working at a hospital might have to design a strategy to reduce the cost of services while also improving the quality. Many problems are far too complex for any one person to resolve. They need to learn how to depend on others. If students are used to working on assignments solo, knowing how to be a good team player may not be intuitive.<br/><br/>To perform well in a group, business school experts suggest students use several strategies. The first one is often figuring out who does what, when and how. Once a team is formed, it's important for all members to agree on objectives and how they'll be achieved. Laying out the ground rules early can establish a structure. A team should also establish processes, such as how often the team will meet, how long those meetings might be, what kind of records will be kept. These discussions, and future team meetings, can go especially well if students know how to listen. What a student says sometimes isn't as important as what they are hearing. Listening is a critical skill for being a team player. Students in groups should be learning from their teammates. They might have a solution for a team problem, but their team member might have a better one. Team members should follow the philosophy "listening to understand versus listening to argue”. If students understand a group member's good ideas and perspectives, it can advance their own thinking. They can integrate the teammate's ideas with their own to come out with better solutions. For instance, business students can practice their listening skills before classes begin, when they meet someone new. Ask them three follow-up questions to learn about them. Don't interrupt. Don't focus on yourself. Doing so will create a deeper relationship. You'll also learn more.<br/><br/><strong>Practice Problems</strong><br/><br/>“Class time”, pre-recorded lecture videos, and virtual office hours will be spent discussing key issues from the assigned reading, working on selected assigned in-class problems from the assigned readings and fielding questions introduced during class. Lectures and the related lecture notes will be brief, highlighting only key points from each topic.  At various times during most classes or pre-recorded lecture videos I will post a question or problem and collect responses from you via some method of classroom response. I will use the responses to determine your collective understanding and whether I am able to move on. You should use these opportunities to test your understanding of the material and identify where you might be confused. Unless specifically told otherwise, all material in each topic assigned is examinable on the cumulative exams.<br/><br/><strong>Preparing for Class</strong><br/><br/>Class sessions will be a combination of lecture, problem solving and discussion.  You are required to read the assigned reading and study the assigned problems before each class / weekly module.  In class, or lecture videos, we will review the assigned reading briefly and then discuss the assigned problems as well as additional questions introduced during class.  The material covered in class is designed to clarify and supplement the text readings and solve problems.  Hence, it is critical that students come to class prepared to discuss the topic and participate in solving the problems.  There will be discussion questions in class based on the reading materials that you will be asked to answer and present to the class.  You will profit very little from any class to which you arrive unprepared.<br/> </p>

<h4><br/><br/>The Weekly Lecture Mini-Quizzes and Term Tests Format</h4><p>All weekly lecture mini-quizzes and term tests will contain a mixture of multiple choice questions, computational, analytical, discussion and short answer explanation/definition/essay questions.</p><p>The dates and times of the cumulative term test examinations will be announced later in LEARN.  The weekly mini-quizzes and term tests will include all material covered prior to and including the date of the quiz / term test.</p><p>There will be no deferred weekly quizzes or term tests.  Based on an approved absence, the weighting of the term test (or other course component) will be adjusted to make up for an excused absence.  Student travel plans are not acceptable grounds for granting an alternative cumulative final term test or final examination time.</p><p>If necessary, due to unexpected unavailability of the Term Tests, the final cumulative examination will be either two or two and one-half hours duration and will be scheduled by the Registrar’s Office during the examination period.  The final cumulative examination is comprehensive, covering material throughout the course.  Both the midterm cumulative examinations and final cumulative examination will be based on material from the course text, readings, and discussions in the lectures and tutorials.  </p><p>Students must bring their Watcard to the term tests, midterms and final examinations.  If a student starts to write an examination without photo identification, the examination may not be graded and a mark of 0 will be assigned.</p><p>All examinations must be the exclusive work of the individual student.</p><p> </p><h4>Team Projects Contribution</h4><p>All students are expected to contribute equally to the Team Projects. Each group member is to complete the peer assessment – instructions are available on the course website in LEARN – and submit this to the instructor by using the provide peer assessment tool by the deadline posted on the course website. Students that do not complete the peer assessment will be deducted grades from their team projects contribution category of the course assessment (up to 100 marks out of 100). The peer assessments submitted by all the team members will be used to assess the contribution by the individual team member and award an appropriate corresponding grade.</p><p> </p><h4>Team Projects Format</h4><p>Student success is highly correlated with ongoing preparation. My experience is that students who prepare consistently during the term do better than students who “cram” for exams. The readings and problems are chosen to help you prepare for the lectures and become familiar with the topics. The assignments are used to give students practice with the concepts. The assignments are completed in assigned teams/groups and must be submitted to a dropbox in Waterloo-LEARN. Due dates will be announced in Waterloo-LEARN.</p><p>It is expected that you will collaborate with your assigned team members and submit one assignment per team.  You should not be collaborating with other teams as it is plagiarism and grounds for disciplinary action.  Late submissions may not be accepted and a late penalty will be applied. Be sure to hand you individual projects and team projects in at least one hour before the deadline to avoid late penalties. Prepare for the unexpected (i.e., WiFi signals lost, slow connections, computer troubles, ...) and do not wait until the last minute to hand in your assignments!  It is expected that there will be approximately 6-9 team project assignments, and appropriate time will be provided in the lectures for the team members to collaborate and also work with the instructor and TA’s that are available throughout the lecture period to monitor team discussions and also interact with teams  to discuss issues with individual teams.</p><p>Late penalties will be applied to the individual and team projects as follows:<br/>    • up to one (1) hour late: 10% penalty on entire project / assignment<br/>    • up to four (4) hour late: 20% penalty on entire project / assignment<br/>    • up to twelve (12) hours late: 30% penalty on entire project / assignment<br/>    • up to twenty-four (24) hours late: 50% penalty on entire project / assignment<br/>    • more than twenty-four (24) hours late: project may not be accepted at all, with up to a 100% penalty on entire project / assignment.</p><p>All individual projects/assignments must be the exclusive work of the individual.</p><p> </p><p>Each student will be awarded the grade assigned to the group unless the other group members advise the instructor that a member was not involved in the preparation of the project. In this case, the instructor may adjust the individual’s grade down (up to 75 marks of 100) from the group grade. Each group member is to complete the peer assessment – instructions are available on the course website – and submit this to the instructor by the deadline posted on the course website. Students that do not complete the peer assessment will be deducted grades from their team projects category of the course assessment (up to 100 marks out of 100); and will also be deducted all of the grades from the team project contribution grade category.</p><p> </p><p>All team projects/assignments must be the exclusive work of the assigned team.</p><p> </p><h4>Use of Computer Resources</h4><p>All students are provided with Waterloo Nexus accounts which provide access to the World Wide Web, the CPA Canada accounting and auditing collection, FASB standards, and other software and databases.  Students are reminded that UW computing facilities exist to support the research, instructional and administrative needs of the University. Misuse of these facilities may lead to disciplinary action.  The Arts Computing Office provides guidelines on the appropriate use of computing facilities (see https://uwaterloo.ca/arts-computing/account-usage-policy ).<br/> </p><h4>Requesting a Regrade</h4><p>Solutions and the marking scheme will be posted on the course web site for the quizzes, term tests, and exams. See the LEARN Content folder for a detailed description.</p><p>If you feel that the marking scheme was not appropriately applied to your submission (quizzes, term tests, assignments/projects and exams only) you should write a brief summary of what you feel was the error in grading your assignment and what you feel is the appropriate revision.  A general comment like “I believe I deserve more” will be ignored.  Your commentary must identify a specific concern with the grading on your work.  Complaints about the severity or laxity of the grading system will be ignored – the issue is whether you feel the grading scheme was properly applied to your submission.</p><p> </p><p>The following procedures apply to appealing your grade on any assignment, quiz or exam:</p><p>1. No appeals will be considered for an adjustment of less than 10% of the total marks available on the assignment or exam.  Since each assignment is worth only approximately 2-4% of your total course grade, appeals of less than 10% (.2 -.4 marks overall) are not material to your overall mark.</p><p>2. You must submit your request for a regrade in writing (email is acceptable) – along with the supporting discussion within one week of when your exam was returned to you.  To ensure a consistent and fair treatment of all regrade requests, late requests for regrading will not be accepted.</p><p>3. Simple computational errors by the TA's (e.g., incorrectly summing the total marks for a question) are not subject to the 10% minimum rule noted above.  However, follow requirement 2 above in notifying the Instructor within 1 week of receiving the graded assignment or exam.</p><p> </p><p>The instructor reserves the right to regrade the entire quiz, term test, examination, or assignment.  Final exam grade appeal procedures are consistent with overall University policy.</p><p> </p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6.<br/> </p><h4>Accommodating religious, creed, and spiritual observances </h4><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp"><u>accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</u></a> under the<u> </u>Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i><u>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</u></i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. Students can complete the Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest, which will inform their instructors of the potential conflict for certain dates. Students must consult with their instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. The self-declaration form for short-term absences may also be used by students requiring an absence of two days or less during the Formal Lecture Period.<br/><br/> </p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a AFM/ARBUS cross-list will count in a ARBUS major average, even if the course was taken under the AFM subject code.<br/><br/> </p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).<br/> </p><h4>Faculty of Arts: Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as collecting, synthesizing, and analyzing information; developing and practicing writing skills; creative expression. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p><br/> </p><h4>I-clickers/Electronic Polling Tools</h4><p>It is considered an academic offence for any individual to allow someone else to use their I-clicker or other electronic polling tool and both the individual who has allowed their device to be used by another and the individual using it will be considered to have engaged in an academic offence. The potential penalties for an offense in this regard will normally include academic suspension.<br/><br/> </p><h4>Changes to in-class Meeting Schedule</h4><p>It is possible, that the university may need to cancel classes for a short period of time and/or transition in person instruction to an online format during the term (and with short notice). In the event of a university required change, or even short-term instructor unavailability due to Covid, using an appropriate technology platform we will normally adopt an alternative meeting schedule that, as much as possible, mirrors/matches the existing in-person meeting schedule for the course/section. Both lectures and exams can be accessed remotely via technology platforms such as Teams, WebEx, Zoom, or MyLab. </p><p>Note that for students Covid-specific accommodations need to be registered through the process mentioned above. Consult the Accommodations for Missed Assessments as well as SAF Process for Requesting Accommodation for Missed Assessments sections. Any on-campus in-person assessments that require modification due to a university mandated change connected to in-person gathering will, if necessary, proceed in a manner that best achieves the intentions of the original assessment format. Any necessary changes will be communicated as soon as we reasonably can during the course of the term.<br/><br/> </p><h4>School of Accounting and Finance Academic Integrity Expectations</h4><p>Students at Waterloo and in SAF are expected to act with integrity, even when faced with difficult situations. Integrity is the cornerstone of the accounting and finance professions. What you practice at the University of Waterloo and in SAF will inform and even define who you are as an A&amp;F professional. As a student at the University of Waterloo and in SAF you are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, avoid committing offences and take responsibility for your actions. While there are common university wide expectations, you will also be expected to know and comply with course specific expectations as well. Participating in the course introduction and reviewing the course syllabus are basic expectations and are helpful regarding course specific academic requirements.</p><p>Policy 71 governs student discipline on campus and SAF works with the Associate Deans of a student’s home faculty when reporting academic misconduct. All suspected academic misconduct, regardless of type or severity, is reported to the appropriate Associate Dean who will review the evidence and apply the appropriate discipline and penalties.</p><p>Specific considerations for SAF students:</p><ul><li>Students majoring in accounting and finance programs at UWaterloo should be aware that, due to the highly structured nature of the study plans and the fact that many AFM courses are offered on a limited basis, a penalty imposed because of an academic offence could result in a significant delay of the student’s degree completion and convocation dates - particularly if the penalty involves a suspension.</li><li>Students placed on disciplinary probation will not be granted access to activities where they are viewed as SAF representatives. For example, students represent SAF in the AFM Fellowship Program, the Student Investment or Venture Fund, at case competitions, as TAs or Research Assistants, and as recruitment ambassadors. This is not an exhaustive list. When applying to participate in these activities, students are expected to declare if they are/are not on disciplinary probation. Normally, this access is denied for a period that spans two complete academic terms subsequent to the term in which the offence occurs.</li></ul><p>The academic integrity expectations for each of the assessments in this course have been outlined above as have the potentially unique implications for SAF students who fail to meet integrity expectations. These expectations are provided for further clarity and accompany the expectations outlined below in the discipline section (University Policy) and do not replace or reduce the importance of these expectations. If ever you are unsure about what’s expected of you, you are responsible for seeking clarification from an appropriate source. “I did not know” is not an acceptable personal justification or formal defense to an allegation.</p><h4>Submission Times </h4><p>Please be aware that the University of Waterloo is located in the Eastern Time Zone (GMT or UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time) and, as such, the time for your activities and/or assignments are due is based on this zone. If you are completing a course online and are outside of the Eastern Time Zone and require assistance converting your time, please try the <a href="https://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_CA-ON.aspx">Ontario, Canada Time Converter</a>. Students are expected to attend and adhere to the course timing set through the Schedule of Classes.</p><h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances</h4><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spaces/">multi-faith spaces</a> that students can use for faith-based practices. </p><h4>SAF Process for Missed Assessments</h4><p>Students are expected to complete all course assessments and write examinations as scheduled; however, there may be circumstances where accommodating a missed assessment is approved. <strong>See your course syllabus for specific accommodation policies that apply to your course.</strong> It is possible the syllabus will identify a process that renders redundant any need to formally declare an absence by means discussed below (e.g., for regular quizzes perhaps the syllabus will identify that only x of y attempts will be included in the final grade).<br/><br/>Review “<strong>Declaring Absences</strong>” below for instructions on how to declare absences and request accommodations for missed course component(s). To be considered for an academic accommodation, SAF students must follow the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Arts Accommodations for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances</a>. <br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation for a missed assessment is approved</u>, the student is responsible for contacting instructor to discuss accommodation arrangements. The instructor will determine the appropriate accommodation.<br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation is approved regarding a missed final exam</u>, the student needs to consult with the course instructor about writing a deferred final exam. In this case, the University of Waterloo Incomplete (INC) grade process will be followed, where all course requirements are not completed during the term. It is important to understand that, particularly with a cooperative education program, it is possible a deferred writing date will not be perfectly convenient to the student. If necessary, a CEE representative may be able to assist a student in their communications with an employer, however, it is still the student’s responsibility to initiate and manage any such process. Other than in exceptional circumstances, students are expected to prioritize writing the exam and completing the course (including making necessary arrangements for time away from work and being on campus). At the end of the current term, students will receive an INC course grade. Once the final exam has been written, a grade revision will be submitted based on the results of the final exam and other course work. Failure to write the final exam at the next SAF identified opportunity will result in a course grade based on the elements of the course that were completed. </p><p>If a student does not utilize one of the indicated approved methods that can justify missing an assessment (and receive some sort of accommodation) or if the request through the VIF or Extenuating Circumstances System is not approved, the student will receive 0 for that course element missed. <br/><br/>It is important to understand and properly utilize the appropriate process. Indicating that someone did not know of a process will not be an accepted justification.</p><h4>Declaring absences </h4><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest</u>. This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness</strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodation, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodation, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture </h4><p>In addition to any other language addressing recording of lectures in this outline, when permission is granted the use of all course recordings is strictly limited to the purpose of private/personal study and for no other reason (e.g., loaning the recording or reproducing a copy for another student, contesting grading, posting in whole or part online, etc.). Any failure to abide by these requirements is a violation of the university's academic integrity requirements and is subject to proceedings under Policy 71, Student Discipline and Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour.  </p><h4>Attendance at the Registered Section</h4><p>You are assigned to a specific section for instructor grading and office hours. If you require a change, please contact an SAF Advisor. It is not appropriate to attend a session you are not enrolled in, without talking to the instructor first. Failure to attend the registered section can result in negative grade consequences (e.g., participation) and students cannot assert that they were otherwise not aware there could be potential negative grade outcomes associated with not attending their registered section.<br/><br/> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. </p><p>Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information">Quest</a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p>
