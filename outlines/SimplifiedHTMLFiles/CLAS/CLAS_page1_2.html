<p>Myths helped the ancient Greeks and Romans make sense of their world and interrogate fundamental experiences of their humanity, such as love and death. Myths from many different cultures still inform our understanding of the world. Greco-Roman myths, the subject of this course, have exerted a profound influence on art, literature, and culture from antiquity to the present day. Our course begins with a discussion of what we mean by "myth" and introduces critical approaches to the interpretation of mythology. We then go on to explore Greco-Roman myths about the creation of the world, the pantheon of gods, the creation of humanity, and the exploits of Greek and Roman heroes/heroines in sagas, quests, and folklore.</p>

  Administrative Policy

<div>
<h3>Course Work Expectations</h3><p>You are expected to dedicate at least five hours per week to study course content and readings, and complete course assessments.</p><h3>Late Policy for Missed Tests</h3><p>If you miss a test due to either declaring a "short-term absence" or submitting a <strong>Verification of Illness Form</strong>, you will be provided with an alternative written assignment to replace the entire grade for the test. Be sure to contact the instructor immediately (i.e., within 48 hours) if you miss a test. </p><p>If you "forget" to write a test, "lose internet" and can't write the test, etc., you must contact the instructor within 48 hours of the test closing. You will be provided with an alternative written assignment to replace the test, <strong>but that assignment will only make up for half of the grade for the missed test</strong>.</p><p>Should you not contact the instructor within 48 hours of the test closing, you will <strong>not</strong> be provided with an alternative assignment and your grade will be a 0.</p><p><strong>No term test will be re-opened after the closing date as this creates academic integrity issues.</strong></p><p><strong>Test times for students will not be changed due to previously booked trips or other events.</strong></p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>We acknowledge that we are living and working on the traditional territory of the Attawandaron (also known as Neutral), Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes ten kilometres on each side of the Grand River.</p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory"><u>CAUT Guide to Acknowledging Traditional Territory</u></a>.</p>

Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.

Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing.
