<p>This seminar uses the close reading approach to study selected texts by contemporary philosophers. The selection of philosophers is based on their reference to architectural and urban themes, as illustrated by this quote by philologist Friedrich Kittler:</p><p>TECHNOLOGY. What strikes the eye of the passerby as a growth or entropy is technology, that is, information. Since cities no longer lie within the panopticon of the cathedral or castle and can no longer be enclosed by walls or fortifications, a network made up of intersecting networks dissects and connects the city–in particular its fringes, peripheries, and tangents. Regardless of whether these networks transmit information (telephone, radio, television) or energy (water supply, electricity, highway), they all represent forms of information. Friedrich Kittler, The City as a Medium </p><p>What is meant by close reading? The seminar will use brief chapters and shorter texts to gain access to the approach. Rather than reading vast quantities of material, the class will look at fragments and discuss the content. This will give students an opportunity to pursue reading in greater depth during thesis.</p><p>Texts will be selected by students during the first two weekes in seminars. The second seminar will present several of the philosophers’ work available on UW Learn and as streamed video by UW Kanopy, Tate Modern, monoskop, ubu.com, etc. for example. The order of the seminars will be determined as a function of student selection of texts. Currently most of the selections are available as digital copies. It may be possible to add additional texts.</p><p>Texts, and excerpts, by the following contemporary philosophers will be available for close reading:</p><p>Giorgio Agamben, The Man without Content, What is an Apparatus, Friends, Metropolis; Kwame Anthony Appiah, Examined Life interview available at  https://uwaterloo.kanopy.com/video/examined-life-0  ; Hannah Arendt, Rosa Luxembourg; On Totalitarianism, Hannah Arendt: On Walter Benjamin 1968,  available at https://uwaterloo.kanopy.com/video/hannah-arendt-walter-benjamin  ; Roland Barthes, The Eiffel Tower; Georges Bataille, The Notion of Expenditure, 1933; Charles Baudelaire, see (in French)  https://www.bnf.fr/fr/agenda/baudelaire-la-modernite-melancolique  ; Zygmunt Bauman, Liquid Modernity; The Trouble With Being Human These Days The Life and Work of Professor Zygmunt Bauman- liquid modernity, by filmmaker Bartek Dziadosz with Albert-László Barabási, Andrew Simms, Cezary Wodziński, George Ritzer, Lydia Bauman, Neal Lawson, Zygmunt Bauman 2013 52 min. https://uwaterloo.kanopy.com/video/trouble-being-human-these-days-0  ; Walter Benjamin, Passages (Excerpt); ’The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction’, ‘The Author as Producer,' in <i>Reflections, Illuminations; </i>Pierre Bourdieu, <i>The Distinction </i>(excerpts); Benjamin Buchloh, The Blade Runner Situation/Option; Judith Butler, What is Critique?

<p>Texts will be selected by students during the first seminar. The first seminar mst be presented before reading week, and the second seminar after, referencing several of the philosophers’ work available as text and streamed video on UW Learn and Kanopy, Tate Modern, monoskop, ubu.com, etc. for example. The order of the seminars will be determined as a function of student selection of texts. Currently most of the selections are available as digital copies. It may be possible to add additional texts. Examples of visualization, diagramming such as the Greimas Square, etc. will be presented in class. </p><p>End of Term <strong>Submission</strong>: Because contemporary ‘media philosophy’ relies on visuals, students may choose to create a set of visualizations, including diagrams, graphs, and schemas in their final project. The final submission may include a concise selection of such images accompanying a series of short essays, preferably an edited set of 5 graphic diagrams along with approximately 1000 words of short texts with titles –a sample format might be 5 diagrams captioned with 200 word paragraphs. Usually students work individually however it may be possible to arrange to work in teams of two.</p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground.
