<p>Since time immemorial, there has been an essential link between mobility and life. Yet to understand mobility beyond the simple physical movement of an object in space (ie. an object moves from point A to point B), it is essential to think about why organisms move in the first place. At the cellular level, this has been identified as understanding the difference between mobility and motility.</p><p><strong>Directed, purposeful movement </strong>is one of the qualities that we most closely associate with living organisms, and essentially all known forms of life on this planet exhibit some type of self-generated movement or motility. Even organisms that remain sessile most of the time, like flowering plants and trees, are quite busy at the cellular level, with large organelles, including chloroplasts, constantly racing around within cellular boundaries. Directed biological movement requires that the cell be able to convert its abundant stores of chemical energy into mechanical energy. Understanding how this mechanochemical energy transduction takes place and understanding how small biological forces generated at the molecular level are marshalled and organized for large-scale cellular or organismal movements are the focus of the field of cell motility.</p><p>For sociologist Vincent Kaufmann, however, this notion of motility is also essential to our understanding of human mobility - in a social sense.</p><p>[Mobility]…refers to how we move and travel in space but does not take into account the social aspect of mobility—the fact that, when we move, we do so not simply for the sake of moving, but to partake in potentially different kinds of activities and, hence, take on different roles. Thus, there is an inherently social dimension to mobility…”Motility" is a term borrowed from biology that means "capable of moving". The word is often used by biologists and is borrowed by social scientists. Motility is the set of factors that allow us to be mobile. When we want to move, we call upon a variety of specific characteristics [social conditions of access, skills, plans]. To me, this is essential because we live in a world where, on the one hand, the <i><strong>intention dimension</strong></i>, the potential at our disposal, is extremely important. It is also central to the issue of<i><strong> social inequalities</strong></i>, which brings us back to the concept of motility as regards to the movement of individuals. This is a point that I believe is very important conceptually for understanding movement and mobility.</p><p>If we consider cities as complex multicellular systems and individuals as cellular components within them, we can effortlessly see the value of better understanding motility in urban and architectural design. Motility in the city transcends simple calculations of ridership and density and must factor in providing environments where individuals and groups, as actors, have the capacity and potential to move <i><strong>with intent</strong></i>.  As Kaufmann notes, no one rides a train just because it is there.</p><p>With this in mind, it is critical to consider the role that expanded public transit plays, and will play, within the Waterloo Region. By 2051 the region is projected to reach just under a million residents with growing pressure to prepare for enough affordable housing and improved public transit in advance. As stated by Grand River Transit and the Waterloo Region in 2016,</p><p>Over the next 20 years, growth will continue as we expect 200,000 new residents to move to our community…Where will these 200,000 new residents live and how will they travel in and around our community? Our traditional pattern of suburban sprawl and single-occupancy car travel is not sustainable as we prepare to add the equivalent of another City of Kitchener to our community. The Region of Waterloo recognizes the need to look at new and improved ways to prepare for the future. (https://rapidtransit.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/resourcesGeneral/ION-Story-Fall-2016-access.pdf)</p><p>This studio will explore this future within the Waterloo Region by focusing on the potential for new GO Stations at Hespeler and Pinebush in Cambridge, as well as the planned Stage 2 ION expansion to extend the existing light rail train from Kitchener into downtown Galt by 2032. If we zoom out of the immediate context, the long term implications of public transit connecting Cambridge to the Toronto and Brantford/Hamilton regions is significant.</p><p>This studio will thus study the possible trajectories for future <i><strong>housing and citizen motility </strong></i>along the ION transit line between Sportsworld, the future Pinebush Transit Hub, and Downtown Cambridge, as well as the possibility for a GO Station in Hespeler (not mapped above).</p><p>Each station will have its own unique urban context that will require its own response in terms of housing typologies and planned urban amenities and services that are accessible for all. Beyond adding an adequate number of “units” to fulfill critical housing needs, how can this be done in a way that ensures there is equitable opportunity for all demographics of citizens, including a special focus on seniors housing, to live within walking distance of the stations, in affordable housing that provides for a high quality of life and dignity?</p><p>To guide these studies, we will explore Equitable Transit-Oriented Design (ETOD), which is described by the <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/equitable-transit-oriented-development/home.html">City of Chicago</a> as the following:</p><p>…development that enables all people regardless of income, race, ethnicity, age, gender, immigration status or ability to experience the benefits of dense, mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented development near transit hubs. ETOD elevates and prioritizes investments and policies that close the socioeconomic gaps between neighbourhoods that are predominately people of colour and those that are majority white. ETOD projects and processes elevate community voice in decision making processes and in realizing community-focused benefits such as affordable housing, public health, strong local businesses, and environmental sustainability, to name a few. When centred on racial inclusion and community wealth building, ETOD can be a driver of positive transformation for more vibrant, prosperous, and resilient neighbourhoods connected to opportunities throughout the city and region.</p><p>In order to ground the studies in a way that responds to the needs of the communities, and with a focus on the needs of the seniors community and their needs, we will engage with the Citizens of Cambridge and other local guests with insights to the future development in the region. A series of talks and discussions with these groups, combined with rigorous research, will allow all studio projects to better understand the needs of the community in developing appropriate housing strategies along the future GO and ION Phase 2 stations.</p>

Across all of the sites that we will be focusing on throughout the semester, there have been ongoing issues of disparity and oppression that were initiated through violent processes of European colonization that included the displacement of Indigenous peoples from the lands that sustained them across Turtle Island (North America), including this region. These processes also brought non-European African and Asian people to North America to work in slavery and indentured servitude. Within this studio we will seek ways to recognize and respect the traditional territory of Indigenous people of this region and their inherit right to be ‘at home’ in the cities now occupying their lands, while also considering ways to address the systemic bias that still organizes Canadian urban spaces, in order to design a more accessible, ecologically sound, and economically sustainable home for all people.</p><h4><strong>Faculty of Engineering Guiding Practices</strong></h4><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.
