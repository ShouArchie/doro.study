<p>The Arch 327 course is an introduction to the structure, organization and form of urban environments, places like towns, cities, metropolitan regions and global networks as understood through their urban architecture. Historical and contemporary forces that determine the creation and development of such urban places will be examined. Topics in the course include the urban plan as a generative form, urban building types, urban morphology and the shape of the public realm, infrastructure as both system and architectural object, nature and the park, and speculation, real estate and governmental urban development controls. Of special interest will be analyses of the historically evolved traditional city, Modernism, the Garden City and suburb, and comprehensive urban master plans.</p><h2>Some Useful Thoughts on City-Building</h2><p><strong>Planning and Design</strong></p><p>The city as it was in the past, as it is today, and as it could be built, will be the broad subject of this course. Primarily, the course will offer a basic introduction to the range of urban design and planning theories and practices in play today. Along with this broad view there will be an equal focus on the relationship between the city’s built fabric and its constituent architecture. In the first weeks especially, it will coordinate with your 3A studio project and lay out basic planning and urban design frameworks for the City of Toronto.</p><p>To architecture students, urban study and the abstract policy-driven methodology of urban planning at times seems un-architectural, either moving into generalized territory like social policy or the statistical minutiae of development statistics. This outlook seems to have little to do with the pleasure of designing and making physical things: streets, parks, squares, buildings, gardens and objects of daily use to name a few.</p><p>To experienced architects, however, the city has often been the field of their creative speculation, one that gives a unifying ground to all of their other design work and theoretical frameworks. The city, like the “Dude” Lebowski’s rug in the film “The Big Lebowski”, is the framework which pulls the design work of an ensemble of disparate individuals together. Often fragmentary, the city is a collective work built out of their architectures. Speculation, furthermore, has a twofold meaning: as a creative theoretical understanding or project, or as a purely capitalistic economic venture. For architects, the former gives a broad universalizing significance to individual building and design works, and the latter, the economic one, is the socio-economic driver of much of professional practice in architecture. A working professional architect needs a job, as 19<sup>th</sup> century Chicago architect H.H Richardson so pithily observed, “I’ll plan anything a man wants, from a cathedral to a chicken coop. That’s how I make my living”.</p><p><strong>Differences between Urban Planning and Urban Design</strong></p><p>Urban planning today, and especially as practiced by both public and private actors in the US and Canada, usually stops its working process at the level of public policy and regulation of land use. It seeks to control the broad aspects of building form using legal or abstracted guideline instruments like density and area limits, building setbacks and massing envelopes. Planning often remains satisfied with being a kind of referee for a very competitive financial game of privately driven economically speculative urban development and its control and shaping by government for the greater public good. This refusal to specifically shape the physical form of our cities is usually built into planning acts and founding legislation of most American and Canadian planning systems, a situation that for most architects is simply wrong-headed and frustrating if the desired goal is a well-designed urban place.</p><p>Urban design often appears to old line urban planners to be the reverse of what might be considered good urban planning methodology. Professional planners typically think of architects as being overly pre-occupied with the building’s physicality, its form and material exposition, and its ultimate appearance. Planners are convinced that architects are unwilling to understand or even recognize the underlying social and economic processes at work in urban development. This professional split of purpose and tools, once very pronounced, has, over the last decade, been papered over as planners in big cities especially, are seeing the value in a more direct building form oriented planning process. They are unwilling, however, to reevaluate the planning tools for built form in cities that have been in place since the end of WW2 giving rise to new problems.</p><p><strong>The Big Picture</strong></p><p>In this situation, the big question for architects is, where is urban design to find its place in the “big picture” of city building with all of its actors: urban planners, engineers, landscape architects, land developers, politicians, activists and citizens, and also, other architects? In contrast to urban planning, the emphasis in urban design is, and has always been, on the desirable, concrete, built result, the city itself as an object of objects, with a broader set of designated and protected liminal spaces that allows all to co-exist and function effectively, and elegantly. Urban design, as is practiced in all its various ideological and methodological outlooks, is a design discipline which has filled that gap in the relationship between the city as an object of policy and functional control, and the city’s designed and evolved physical form. It is a discipline which gives pre-eminence to the urban project, and not necessarily only to good urban policy and regulation of urban functions, building densities, and socio-political goals.</p><p>The detailed physical form and character of the city is the goal of urban designers, and not an end result based solely on adherence to good policy as is practiced by planning professionals. For that reason, urban designers in practice today have usually been trained primarily in architecture or landscape architecture schools. Urban design is the professional territory of architects for built form and landscape architects for public spaces.</p><p><strong>The Place of the Urban Building Project</strong></p><p> The urban building project at whatever scale will be a central focus in this course. Such a project whether it is a an urban district, a group of buildings, a building or even an interior like a shop or café will be defined with respect to the more concrete aspects of the city it finds itself in: its buildings, neighbourhoods, streets, parks, infrastructures and institutions. Urban design is about conceiving and building a "big picture". It is <strong><u>not</u></strong> about creating super-sized multi-building architectural projects done at a large scale, and this must be emphasized in a course taught in an architecture school. Rather, it is about working the elements of the typical city’s urban system laid out above, to find the place of the individual project in the layered palimpsest of all the works spanning back to the city’s origins.</p><p>Urban design projects must deal with issues that are normally unfamiliar or even peripheral to architects’ primary concerns, those of programmatic, formal or technical concerns. Instead, in an urban design, property relationships, social divisions, politics, finance of real estate speculation, public regulation of that speculation, and the interaction on every level between buildings and the physical implications of the urban infrastructures that sustain our cities, all become key issues and elements of the urban design project.</p><p><strong>The Subject of the Course</strong></p><p>The course will generally examine urban design as the middle ground between the two disciplines of architecture and urban planning. This increasingly widespread view of the urban design profession emphasizes urban projects as a means for transformation of the city. In such a view, architectural projects are urban interventions that reify form and structure for more ephemeral issues of economic and social planning, the impact of new technologies and infrastructures, the role of capital investment and profit in financial speculation in urban land development, urban governance, politics, and how the social polity struggles to shape the search for a shared urban destiny.</p><p>This middle ground of the actual building the city will be the main subject of this course. The course will offer a range of views, and it will seek to offer useful tools and concepts for the architectural actor… maybe even the ‘player’… in the economic and political dynamics by which cities are conceived and developed.</p><p>The broad architecture of the city or the “architecture of the urban environment” and that of the broader metropolitan area will be presented both as an analytical discourse with its own terminology, and a synthetic discourse emphasizing the physical construction of the city as a continuing series of projects. Its approach will be founded in architecture as the ultimate physical manifestation of the entire complex discourse that goes into shaping the broader urban development process and, even more, shaping the places in which we all live, work and play. </p><p><strong>What the Course is Not</strong></p><p>This course will not offer any ideal urban design approaches or solutions as a panacea for unaffordable housing or climate change (as examples). There will be no favoured design or ideological viewpoint from which design will be made easy; no simple formulas like “Modernism” or “New Urbanism” or “Landscape Urbanism” or the “New Metropolitan Field”. The goal of the course is to offer the tools to students to make them more sophisticated critics of the city and a better urban designer regardless of their ideological outlook.</p>

  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Provide theoretical and practical background materials to facilitate the Arch 392 architectural design studio projects and the consideration of their urban settings. At the conclusion of this section of the 327 course lectures, students will have an introduction to the urban design theory, design methodologies, urban planning frameworks, and working practice at the heart of the Greater Toronto Area’s capitalist private land development, and the activist/societal/public regulation in the shaping of community dwelling and public space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Introduce urban planning and urban design practice. Urban development methodologies globally and in the GTA locally are shaped by the deeply rooted forces of financial speculation and those frameworks of urban regulation seated in provincial and municipal government and planning law. Citizen activism is the third force in this political decision-making about the future of the communities that we all live in. The objectives of this section of Arch 327 will focus on the role of buildings in shaping urban places, and how their design plays out in the city’s urban land systems, property organizations, land assemblies, urban density descriptions and statistics, urban zoning practice, infrastructure rights-of-way, speculative pro-formas, and the social policy goals for affordable housing. At the conclusion of this section, the student will be able to undertake a basic urban design project within a framework of regulations and in an existing urban setting. Also, the student will be able to develop a set of planning statistics for their project work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Introduce a general theoretical context and an analytically based “urban science” as articulated by urban theorist Aldo Rossi. At the end of this section, the student will have a theoretical picture of the city and its metropolitan region as an evolved environment, or territory, one shaped by both its history and the sense of its broader urban destiny moving into the future. At the end of this section, students will be able to analyze an urban place, examine it with a critical theoretical eye, and begin to develop an understanding of its evolving built form. Such an outlook as Rossi offers will also be very useful for student work in the upcoming Arch 4A Rome term.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Survey the various urban paradigms, both historic and in play, underlying today’s global urbanism. Students will be aware of the diverging viewpoints of the city in different cultures and the divergent urban futures that will confront them in their future practices. Topics include the historically evolved traditional city, and its complex negotiated cultural forms and conflicts, the Garden City and its global variants, the Socialist City and its rejection of capitalist speculation, Modernism and its technocratic impulses for infrastructure and technology, and the ongoing unstoppable search for “the new” which underlies all of the above variants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Introduce the Sustainable City as a way pointing to the climate change future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Introduce discussion of the informal city, those massive areas of urban regions built outside any official system of planning and governance, but which house probably the larger part of humanity.</td>

<p><strong>Late Work</strong></p><p>Grades for late work submitted on LEARN without advance notice to the course instructor or teaching assistants will be penalized 5% for each late day (with the exception of the “late passes” described below). There will also be a reasonable amount of flexibility framed around the hand-in time and date to accommodate the more general issues associated with digital submissions.</p><p>Only in the case of justified medical or personal reasons will these penalties be waived, and only if these have been officially submitted to the Undergraduate Student Services Co-Ordinator, and accepted by the Undergraduate Office. Students seeking accommodations due to COVID-19, are to follow Covid-19-related accommodations as outlined by the university in the paragraphs below.</p><p>There will be an inclusion of one “late pass” per student over the term – whereby students can opt to submit an Assignment 1 or 2 deliverable at a near later date without penalty or justification. This date will be approved by the course instructor prior to the original submission deadline. We hope this slight easing will be helpful for student stress and health management.</p>
