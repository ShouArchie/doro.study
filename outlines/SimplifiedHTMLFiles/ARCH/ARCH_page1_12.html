  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ARCH 364:</div>
<p>The physio-technical factors that influence building design for performance, durability, efficiency, health, and sustainability will be explored. Common building design construction problems, their causes and solutions, will be examined with the aid of case studies. Using the principles of building science, good details of masonry, wood, steel, and glass will be developed.</p>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>This course develops an understanding of scientific principles, as well as economic, technical, and practical factors that influence <i>good building design for physical performance</i> (durability, health, safety, resource, and energy efficiency) &amp; thus sustainability. Principles of siting, shape, orientation and enclosure design from earlier courses will be briefly reviewed and applied to enclosure design.  Enclosure science and technology will be the focus in the context of modern professional practise, especially larger buildings that Canadian architects are mostly involved with.</p>
