<p>ARCH 193 is the second in a series of design studios intended to engage students in spatial thinking and architectural representation. Building on the design foundations acquired in ARCH 192, students will continue developing design and representation skills, architectural literacy, and critical thought, albeit in increasingly more complex contexts.</p><p>Within this studio, architecture is treated as a practice-based discipline engaged by way of a variety of activities, or operations. The 1B studio will foreground accessible building and site design as well as material and tectonic explorations as key drivers of architectural production. Students will be asked to think about the strategies, methods, and materials used to help shape ideas and forms. Assignments are organized around three sets of design exercises which will serve as the primary vehicles for students to pursue these learning objectives, experiment, take risks, and take clear intellectual positions.</p>

<h4><strong>Material Costs</strong></h4><p>ARCH 193 consists of a material-oriented set of investigations that have material costs. It is expected that participants purchase required materials to support these explorations as well as plotting for project reviews. Please budget $300-$600CAD for material and plotting costs for the term.</p><h4><strong>Field Trips</strong></h4><p>As part of Project 3, the studio will involve two 1-day field trips to support learning and engagement with existing libraries. Participation in these field trips is tied to evaluated course components and is, therefore, required. Transportation to and from the field trip destinations will be arranged by the Administrative Office at the School of Architecture. Transportation costs will be paid for by students. Students should tentatively allot $80CAD for the cost of transportation for both trips ($40CAD per trip). This fee is subject to change and only includes the bus between the field trip destinations and the School of Architecture in Cambridge. This fee does not cover meals or any other costs students may incur during the trips. Students should be prepared to pay the field trip transportation cost within the first two weeks of the semester when prompted to by the Administrative Office.</p>

<p><strong>Project 1: Structure and Light </strong>- 25% of total grade - completed individually</p><p>For project 1, students are asked to design a roof system that is protective, load-bearing, and provides experiential qualities attuned to our distinct climactic and daylighting conditions. This exercise will serve as a springboard into designing flexible long-span spaces for the library and community hub in Project 3.</p><p><i>Learning Objectives: </i></p><ul><li>Gain dexterity and familiarity with rapidly iterating through design concepts and physical prototyping.</li><li>Demonstrate understanding of human scale. This includes both the relation between proportional elements in a composition and the relation between the human body and the spaces it occupies both physically and visually.</li><li>Apply organizational, spatial, material, structural, and constructional principles to the conception and development of spaces, building elements and tectonic components.</li><li>Utilize daylighting as an effective driver and space-defining tool in the process of design.</li><li><u>CACB SPC – C2</u>: The student must have an understanding of the basic principles used in the appropriate selection and application of architectural materials as it relates to fundamental performance, aesthetics, durability, energy, resources, and environmental impact.</li></ul><p><strong>Project 2: Reverse Competition</strong> - 15% of total grade - completed in groups</p><p>To prepare for Project 3, Project 2 will serve as a case study of the library typology. To execute this case study, students will put themselves in the mind of the project architects, developing a graphic competition proposal to communicate the key ideas of their selected case study building.</p><p><i>Learning Objectives: </i></p><ul><li>Gain an applied understanding of historical and contemporary approaches to library and community hub design.</li><li>Investigate diagramming and abstraction as design drivers.</li><li>Apply graphic storytelling and critically position the hierarchy of concepts.</li><li><u>CACB SPC – A1</u>: The student must demonstrate an ability to articulate a design process grounded in theory and practice, an understanding of design principles and methods, and the critical analysis of architectural precedents.</li></ul><p><strong>Project 3: The New Library</strong> - 60% of total grade - completed individually</p><p>Building on skills developed up to this point, students will design a modern library/community hub in an urban context. Through the development of the project, students will be encouraged to incorporate knowledge from parallel technical courses.</p><p><i>Learning Objectives:</i></p><ul><li>Use representational tools such as sections, vignettes, massing models, and site analysis as design drivers.</li><li>Investigate the necessary spatial and atmospheric qualities that support vibrant, inclusive, and functional,</li><li>community spaces.</li><li>Develop an understanding of accessible and barrier-free design principles found in the building code.</li><li>Develop an understanding of design for inclusivity using mobility, cognition, and multi-sensory aids.</li><li>Use architectural design tools to spatially curate conflicting and diverse programmatic requirements in a</li><li>small building footprint.</li><li>Apply environmental stewardship strategies informing material and tectonic approaches.</li><li><u>CACB SPC – C1</u>: The student must have an understanding of the applicable building codes, regulations, and standards for a given building and site, including universal design standards and the principles that inform the design and selection of life‐safety systems.</li><li><u>CACB SPC – C2</u>: The student must have an understanding of the basic principles used in the appropriate selection and application of architectural materials as it relates to fundamental performance, aesthetics, durability, energy, resources, and environmental impact.</li></ul><p>In addition to the criteria provided as part of each assignment outline, all submissions will be evaluated on:</p><p><u>Intellectual Clarity</u>: Inquiry and extension of the course material will be essential to producing successful explorations. Students must be able to clearly articulate their design ambitions, intellectual underpinnings, and all design work in discussions, desk crits, pin-ups and presentations.</p><p><u>Independent Inquiry</u>: Student are expected to advance their projects through self- motivated and self-framed agendas and pursuits. Projects are seen as offering students a framework through which to explore and exercise architectural skills.</p><p><u>Technique/Craft</u>: All work must be executed with intent and care where the precision and craft of artifacts created are continuously valued.</p><p><u>Attendance and Steady Progress</u>: Work should be developed over the entire length of a project. Iteration and incremental development are paramount.</p><p>The following is offered as a guide to numerical grade assignments:</p><p><strong>90+:</strong> Consistent exemplary work that exceeds expectations. Work is holistically thought provoking and executed at a very high level.</p><p><strong>85-89:</strong> Some elements of work are exceeding expectations and executed at a high level, but this level of achievement is not maintained throughout all project elements.</p><p><strong>80-84: </strong>Work is consistently above average, and student is actively participating and actively engaging the course material.</p><p><strong>77-79: </strong>Average work. Student is completing work in a timely manner and participating in the course. No attendance issues. Shows expected levels of competency in course materials.</p><p><strong>70-76:</strong> Work is complete and meets expectations on some points while operates below expectations on others.</p><p><strong>60-69: </strong>Work is incomplete or completed with minimal comprehension and effort.</p><p><strong>60-: </strong>Work is unacceptable and does not fulfill the course requirements.</p><p><strong>Desk Critiques</strong></p><p>Studio days will generally be for scheduled ‘desk crits.’ Students are expected to generate a significant amount of new work for these critiques. Time outside of scheduled crit times on studio days should be used for working on studio projects. These are great opportunities to produce new work, as well as share your work with your peers, and get a second opinion. As you become familiar with 3D modelling, it is important that you continue to produce/print drawings for crits. Showing a project by flying around a model can be very disorienting and difficult to annotate. In addition to this, the act of creating a drawing will reveal design issues and opportunities not present in a model. Students are thus required to print their drawings and bring trace paper to all desk critiques so that they may be as productive as possible in design discussions. Due to the structure of this studio, you may see multiple instructors and teaching assistants over the course of one project. This makes it important for you to take ownership over your ideas and motives so that they remain strong as you get feedback from different sources. The role of the instructors is to support your inquiry, not to tell you what your project is about.</p><p><strong>Collaborative Work</strong></p><p>Professional practice in architecture, design, or engineering takes place through close collaborations between teams of people. Identifying effective ways to communicate, assign responsibilities, identify milestones and achieve objectives are essential skills to succeed in professional practice. For this reason, the studio will require students to work in teams at various points throughout the term. This collaboration should allow for intensive work and iteration to take place in parallel. All members of each group will be graded equally.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Late Work</h4><p>Course deliverables that are handed in late will receive an initial penalty of 1% per hour if submitted within the first 3 hours of the deadline. An additional 5% penalty will be applied to course deliverables submitted within the subsequent 21-hour period. This means that all late course deliverables submitted more than 4 hours after the deadline will receive an automatic 8% deduction. Course deliverables handed in 24 hours beyond the deadline will receive 0%. ARCH 193 relies on digital tools to complete all course deliverables. Students are expected to work diligently to ensure all assignments are submitted on time.

We recognize, however, that discrimination does occur, sometimes through an isolated act but also through practices and policies that must be changed. If you experience discrimination, micro-aggression, or other forms of racism, sexism, discrimination against LGBTQ2S+, or disability, there are different pathways to report them: </p><p>A) If you feel comfortable bringing this up directly with the faculty, staff or student who has said or done something offensive, we invite you or a friend to speak directly with this person. People make mistakes and dealing them directly in the present may be the most effective means of addressing the issue. </p><p>B) you can reach out to program administrators. For undergraduate students, this includes <a href="mailto:tina.davidson@uwaterloo.ca">Tina Davidson,</a> Academic Services Coordinator, and <a href="mailto:tboake@uwaterloo.ca">Terri Boake,</a> Associate Director, Undergraduate Studies. For graduate students, <a href="mailto:mark.anderton@uwaterloo.ca">Mark Anderton</a> is the academic services coordinator, and <a href="mailto:lola.sheppard.uwaterloo.ca">Lola Sheppard</a> is the associate director of graduate studies. School director <a href="mailto:%20mmprzyby@uwaterloo.ca">Maya Przybylski</a>  is also available to handle concerns and disclosures. If you contact any of these people in confidence, they are bound to preserve your anonymity and follow up on your report.  </p><p>C) You may also choose to report centrally to the Equity Office.

Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
