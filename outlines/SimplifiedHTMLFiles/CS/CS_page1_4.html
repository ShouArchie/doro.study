<h4>Additional Notes</h4><ul><li>You must pass the weighted average of the weekly quizzes and final exam.</li><li>You must get at least 40% on the final exam in order to pass the course.</li></ul><h4>Module Questions and Exercises</h4><p>By default, programming questions all allow unlimited attempts. Other questions such as multiple choice, multiple select, and short answer questions typically allow one or two. There may be some exceptions, so be sure to verify the number of attempts permitted before answering a question.</p><p>All multiple choice, short answer, and multiple select module questions are equally weighted and are worth 1 point each. All coding exercises are equally weighted and are worth 2 points each. We will drop 5% of your lowest scoring answers of each type. This means it is possible to get the full 20% for the <i>Module Questions and Exercises</i> component of your final grade without answering every question correctly.</p><p> </p><p>Note the "Progress" tab at the top of every page of the course. You can use that page to track your completion of concept checks and quiz questions. Make sure you don't accidentally skip anything!</p><h4>Assignments</h4><p>There will be eight assignments during the term. Assignments will consist of programming questions.</p><p>You will submit assignments using Learn, which allows TAs to view and mark the assignment and provide you with feedback. Always read the feedback from TAs. They may tell you about errors that could cause you to lose marks in later assignments.</p><h4>Weekly Quizzes</h4><p>There will be 11 weekly quizzes during the term. They will be timed and completed on Learn. Weekly quizzes are equally weighted. We will drop the lowest scoring result of the weekly quizzes and calculate the grade based on the remaining quiz scores.</p><h4>Final Project</h4><p>There will be a final project for the course. The details of the project will be posted later in the term. It is expected to be approximately the scope of between two and three assignments. There will be ample time to complete the project after the last weekly assignment is due.</p><h4>Final Exam</h4><p>There will be a final exam at the end of the term, after the end of lectures. The time will be scheduled by the registrar. The exam will be proctored and in-person, and it will be written on paper.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Assignment deadlines</h4><p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you submit your assignment correctly before the deadline. The deadline is based on the time of day in Waterloo, Ontario (Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Time, depending on the time of year). The current date and time in Waterloo are always shown at the top-right of course web pages.</p><p><strong>Late assignment submissions will never be accepted under any circumstances.</strong> We will not grant an extension because you attempted to submit at the last minute, or because your internet connection failed at the crucial moment of submission. We will not accept an assignment sent via email. We will not accept a revision after the deadline that fixes a typo that prevented your assignment from working.</p><p>Start early, submit early, and submit often. Give yourself (more than) enough time to submit.</p><h4>Missed assignments/Tests or Quizzes</h4><p>If you are unable to complete an assignment because of illness, or other extenuating circumstances, submit appropriate documentation to Quest.<strong> There is no need to contact course staff. </strong>We are notified daily of absences and at the discretion of the course staff, you will be excused from completing the missed assignment (or other components) and your other assignments will be reweighted to compensate. If you miss too many assignments, you may be asked to withdraw from the course.</p><h4>Re-marking</h4><p>If you feel that there was an error or oversight in the marking of your assignment, please fill out the Remark Request form for the particular assignment on Learn. The forms will be in a Survey on Learn for each assignment for two weeks. The remark will be done following the two week period. After submitting a remark request ISAs will review and remark your entire assignment; if there are any major concerns then these will be communicated to the instructors if needed. Note that your assignment grade may increase or decrease after a remark.</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
