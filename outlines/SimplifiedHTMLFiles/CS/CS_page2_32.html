<h2>Passing Average on Exam Components</h2><p>In order to pass CS 479, you must have a passing average (at least 50%) on the written exam component of the course. That is, if you get <i>M</i> out of 20 on your midterm, and <i>F</i> out of 50 on your final exam, then you need <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>M</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>F</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>≥</mo><mn>35</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(M+F)\ge35</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true"><span><span></span><span>(</span><span>M</span><span></span><span>+</span><span></span></span><span><span></span><span>F</span><span>)</span><span></span><span>≥</span><span></span></span><span><span></span><span>3</span><span>5</span></span></span></span></span>to pass the course, regardless of what your course average is.</p><h2><strong>Assignments</strong></h2><p>There will be 5 assignments, approximately one every 2 weeks. All submissions will be electronic. Some questions will be mathematical derivations or proofs, and some questions will involve programming in Python.</p><p>For each <u>programming question</u>, you will submit your solutions through <strong>Github Classroom</strong>, of as a PDF to <strong>Crowdmark.</strong> Instructions will be given for each programming assignment. We will use Python (version 3.9 or later).</p><p>For each <u>non-programming question</u>, you will <strong>submit a PDF or JPEG to Crowdmark</strong>, either of handwritten solutions (scanned or photographed), or typeset (eg. using Microsoft Word, LaTeX, etc.). If a photo of handwritten work is submitted, it is your responsibility to ensure that it is legible.

Also, if you submit solutions more than once, only your most recent submission will be graded.</p><p>If your assignment is late, your assignment grade will be multiplied by a lateness scaling factor, <i>s</i>. This factor decreases by 10% per hour (on the hour), and then drops to zero after 10 hours. For example, if your assignment is 4 hours late, then the scaling factor is 0.6.</p><h2><strong>Midterm Exam</strong></h2><p>There will be a midterm exam from 7:00-9:00pm on Wednesday February 12, 2025. You will be allowed to bring a crib sheet; you can put anything you want on one side of an 8.5x11" piece of paper.</p><p>If you miss the midterm due to an absence, the weight of the midterm will be shifted to your final assessment (final exam for students taking CS 479, and final project for students taking CS 679).</p><h2><strong>Final Assessment</strong></h2><h3><strong>Final Exam</strong></h3><p>If you are registered in CS 479, you will write a 2.5-hour final exam, meant to test your knowledge about all parts of the course. You will be allowed to bring a crib sheet; you can put anything you want on <strong>both sides</strong> of an 8.5x11" piece of paper.</p><h3><strong>Project</strong></h3><p>Only students registered in CS 679 can do a project. The projects will be done in groups of 2 students, and will involve implementing a method from a paper, and reproducing some of its results. If you desire some inspiration, a list of example papers will be posted.</p><p>Your group must submit a project proposal by March 7. Your group must also submit a final report and github repository by April 18. More information about the project will be given at a later date.</p>

<h3>Re-Grading Requests</h3><p>Did we give you too few marks (or too many)? You can request to have part of your assessment reviewed. Here's how.</p><p>Submit a <strong>private message</strong> to the instructors on piazza <i><u>describing specifically what you think the error was</u></i> with your grading. Make sure to label the post with the "<strong>regrade</strong>" folder, as well as the appropriate assessment folder (eg. "<strong>a2</strong>"). All re-grade requests must be made within 7 days of when the assessment was returned to you.</p><h3>Two-Day Absence</h3><p>If you declare a 2-day absence and there is an assignment deadline during that absence, you have two choices:</p><ol><li>The weight from the missed assignment can be put on your final assessment, or</li><li>The assignment deadline is given a 48-hour extension.</li></ol><p>For example, suppose assignment 1 (A1) is due at 11:59pm on Jan 22, and is worth 9% of your total grade, and you declare a 2-day absence that overlaps that deadline. If you choose option 1, then the 9% for A1 will shift onto your final assessment (exam, or project, as appropriate), which would then be worth 59% of your total grade (instead of 50%). If you choose option 2, your deadline for A1 would be 11:59pm on Jan 24, and the late policy would extend for 10 hours after that.</p><p>You <strong>must</strong> inform the professor of your absence in writing via email (<u>not</u> on Piazza), and state which option you would like. Note that <strong>neither option will be applied by default.</strong> <u>You have to explicitly choose one of the options</u>, and indicate your choice in an email to Prof. Orchard/Prof. Hibat-Allah before the original deadline.</p><p>If you miss the midterm due to an absence, the weight of the midterm will be shifted to your final assessment (final exam for students taking CS 479, and final project for students taking CS 679).</p><h3>Continuity of In-Person Course Components</h3><p>If there is an interruption in our ability to meet in-person for lectures, the course will continue in a modified form. Videos of the lectures will be posted in the Resources page on Piazza. Students will be expected to watch these lecture videos in lieu of attending class. Regularly scheduled Zoom sessions will be held to answer questions about the lecture material or assignments.</p><p>The assignment procedures will not be affected by a cancellation of in-person classes since they are distributed and submitted online.</p><p>If the in-person final exam is cancelled, I will instead issue a take-home final exam. Students will be asked to sign a confidentiality and academic integrity agreement before writing the exam. Students will be given a 24-hour period during which the exam must be written. The exam will likely be a combination of two parts: (1) questions that should be answered by hand-written or typeset solutions and submitted to Crowdmark, and (2) an online quiz. Once a student starts the quiz, they will have a fixed window of time to complete it.</p><h3>Generative AI</h3><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgment. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class, and are outlined as follows: </p><ul><li><strong>What you can do:</strong> GenAI can be used as a smart substitute for Google search, e.g., code debugging, finding plotting commands. Cite GenAI when it is used and where it helped. Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a></li><li><strong>What you can't do:</strong> GenAI must not be used to code up the logic of a solution, or part of a solution. It cannot be used to generate significant portions of code. Students are encouraged to read more about the ethical use of GenAI here: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/artificial-intelligence-and-chatgpt#tipsforstudents"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/artificial-intelligence-and-chatgpt#tipsforstudents</u></a> . If you are not sure when it is ethical/permitted to use GenAI, please consult with your instructors.</li></ul><p>Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI.</p><h2><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement</strong></h2><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
