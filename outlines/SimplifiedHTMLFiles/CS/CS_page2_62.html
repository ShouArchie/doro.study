  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>TA Office Hours</h4><p>TAs are available to answer assignment related questions only during office hours. <strong>TAs will only answer questions related to implementation-based assignments.</strong> Questions for other assignments and the course material should be sent to the instructor. A schedule of office hours will be announced in the first two weeks of the term. <strong>TAs will only answer questions during office hours, they will not answer questions on Piazza.</strong></p><h4>Piazza</h4><p>Students can use Piazza posts to ask questions about assignments. Questions related to the material or to assignments with written answers will be answered by the course instructor.</p><p>The TAs and course instructor will <strong><u>not </u></strong>answer Piazza questions related to the implementation assignments. For questions related to implementation assignments, please use the TA office hours.</p><p>For general questions about implementation assignments you can still ask them on Piazza and ask for help from other students in the class. Collaboration on solving common problems with implementation assignments is encouraged. Questions that are specific to a student’s assignment solution including a student’s assignment implementation details (such as code particulars) must be asked in TA office hours and not shared on Piazza. A breach of this guideline will be considered a violation of academic integrity and it will be dealt with according to the university procedures described in Policy 71, Student Discipline: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71</a></p><h4>Plagiarism</h4><p>Plagiarism is representing the work of others as your own. Plagiarism on an exam includes communicating in any way with others over the duration of the exam. Plagiarism on assignments includes copying another student’s solution and submitting it as your own, allowing another student to copy your solution, collaborating excessively with another student, or obtaining solutions from any other source. The standard penalty for plagiarism is a grade of zero for that piece of work, with a minimum deduction of 5% from the final course grade. In addition, you would be placed on disciplinary probation for the remainder of your undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo.</p><p>All academic offenses are reported to the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies and are recorded in the student’s file. Subsequent academic offenses in the same course or in other courses will lead to more severe penalties, up to and including suspension and expulsion.</p><p>You may discuss general concepts and problems with classmates, tutors, TAs, and instructors. However, the solution that you submit must be worked through by yourself and written in your own words. It is not acceptable to work on an assignment or exam with somebody else and write it up individually. When discussing course matters, do not take notes, and do not look at another person’s partial solutions, or show them yours. When trying to deal with difficulties, do not consult books other than the textbook, or any Web sources, unless explicitly authorized to do so.</p><h4>Assignment and Exam Policies</h4><p>Assignments and Exam are to be completed individually. </p><p>Assignments submitted after the due date will not be accepted.</p><p>If you believe that you received an unfair mark on an assignment, you have up to one week from the date the assignment was handed back to request a re-mark. Please e-mail a written explanation to the instructor justifying why you think your assignment should be re-marked.</p><h4>Copyright and Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ol><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., Power-Point slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li><li>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</li><li>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</li></ol><p><strong>Math Faculty code-sharing policy</strong>: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/code-sharing-policy">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/code-sharing-policy</a></p><h4>Use of Generative AI tools and technologies</h4><p>Use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, or code, like Chat GPT or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class/course. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of University Policy 71 (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance).</p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
