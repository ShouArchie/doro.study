<p><strong>For graduate students:</strong> the above scaled to 80% + 20% survey paper</p><p><strong>Midterm and Final Assessment:</strong> These assessments are written-only (no programming) but may cover any material taught until each assessment's date. If a student misses the midterm, its weight will be shifted to the final exam. Final grades will be available after the end of term through LEARN.</p><h4><strong>Assignments:</strong></h4><p>The three assignments are meant to be completed individually. The assignments are based on a mix of theory (written) and practical (programming) exercises. Students will leverage the knowledge and techniques presented in the lectures for completing the assignments.</p><p>The assignments are due at 3:00 pm Eastern Time on their respective due dates. Please start working on the assignments in advance of the deadlines. Late submissions for Assignments 1, 2, and 3 will be accepted only up to 48 hours after the original due date. There is no penalty for accepted late submissions. Assignments can be submitted multiple times, and the last one will be used for marking. Course personnel <u>will not</u> give assistance for assignments after their original due dates, so you are encouraged to respect the due date.</p><h4><strong>Remarking Policy:</strong></h4><p>If you have an assignment that you would like to have reappraised, please follow the instructions given on LEARN to submit your request. Include a clear justification for your claims. The appeals deadline is one week after the respective graded item is first made available. If your appeal is concerned with a simple calculation error, please see the TA(s) during their office hours.</p><h4><strong>Research Survey Paper (CS 689):</strong></h4><p>Students registered in CS 689 must write a research survey paper on a topic related to data security or privacy. In writing your paper, you must become familiar with the research literature relevant to your topic. Your focus should be on academic venues, such as the USENIX Security Symposium, ACM CCS, IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS), or the NDSS Symposium.</p><p>Your topic must be approved in advance by the instructors before you submit your full survey at the end of term. Your proposal should be one page in length and include at least 10 references, preferably including (but not limited to) papers from the aforementioned venues. Email your proposal to the instructors by <u>February 12th</u>.</p><p>Your paper should be a summary of past and current work on your topic, as well as an overview of known open problems and potential future directions in the area. You should provide a concise summary of work, emphasizing major accomplishments, rather than a detailed accounting of individual pieces of research activity. Email your final paper to the instructors by <u>April 4th</u>.</p><p>Your proposal and paper paper should be formatted in the two-column ACM proceedings format, using one of the ACM SIG Proceedings Templates. Your paper should not be longer than six pages. The ACM templates include headings for “Categories and Subject Descriptors”, “General Terms”, and “Keywords”, which you do not need to use.</p>

<h3><strong>Communication</strong></h3><p>Please direct all communication to the Piazza discussion forum. This includes questions about materials in lectures, assignments, and general logistics.<br/>It is your responsibility to keep up with all course-related information posted to LEARN, the course Piazza forum, and the course website.</p><h4><strong>Etiquette:</strong></h4><p>Please go through your peers' and the instructors/TAs' notes or comments, before posting a question. If question doesn't exist and it involves private content (query about grades, partial progress towards solution), then create a private question that is only visible to the instructors and TAs. (The instructor(s) or TAs may make a private question public, possibly after editing it, if they decide that it is of general interest.) Otherwise, in general, create a public one so that your peers can benefit too. Tag your question with the appropriate folder for the assignment, etc.</p><h4><strong>Email:</strong></h4><p>Important course information will generally be posted to LEARN, but may also be sent to your uwaterloo.ca email address. For personal matters, such as an illness, please email the instructors directly. We will only reply back to email from your uwaterloo.ca email address, for privacy rules.</p><h3><strong>Mental Health Support</strong></h3><p>All of us need a support system. We encourage you to seek out mental health supports when they are needed. Please reach out to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services"><u>Campus Wellness and Counselling Services</u></a>.<br/>We understand that these circumstances can be troubling, and you may need to speak with someone for emotional support. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/services/good2talk"><u>Good2Talk</u></a> is a post-secondary student helpline based in Ontario, Canada that is available to all students.</p><h3><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement</strong></h3><p>We acknowledge that we live and work on the traditional territory of the Attawandaron (Neutral), Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes ten kilometres on each side of the Grand River.</p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
