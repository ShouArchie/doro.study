<h4>Assignments</h4><p>Assignments will be posted on Crowdmark. Check regularly to make sure you are using the most recent version (corrections will be made to the web posting, if necessary, and an electronic announcement will be made about it). All assignments must be submitted electronically on Crowdmark by the assignment’s due date at 5:00pm.</p><p>There will be four assignments. Assignment submissions generally include analytical/written work and/or programming problems. You must submit your work in two parts:</p><p>1. Upload one or more PDF(s) to Crowdmark for both your written/analytical work and your notebooks with the results/output included (including tables, figures, numerical data, etc). (i.e., the TA should be able to look at your PDF to immediately see your results without re-running the notebook.)</p><p>2. Any and all notebooks/code/scripts/data files you wrote to solve the programming problems should also be submitted electronically as a single ZIP file to the appropriate assignment Dropbox on LEARN. This should allow the TAs to run your code if necessary. (If you submit one part before the deadline and one part after, the later of the two submission times will be used.)</p><p>Students are encouraged to discuss assignment solutions with the instructor and TAs after the assignments are returned. However, solutions are not normally posted on the web.</p><h4>Assessment Schedule</h4><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Week 4</td><td>Assignment 1</td><td>Friday, Jan 31 @ 5:00pm</td></tr><tr><td>Week 6</td><td>Assignment 2</td><td>Friday, Feb 14 @ 5:00pm</td></tr><tr><td>Week 9</td><td>MIDTERM</td><td>Tuesday, Mar 4 @ 5:30pm - 7:20pm</td></tr><tr><td>Week 11</td><td>Assignment 3</td><td>Wednesday, Mar 18 @ 5:00pm</td></tr><tr><td>Week 13</td><td>Assignment 4</td><td>Wednesday, Apr 2 @ 5:00pm</td></tr><tr><td>TBD</td><td>FINAL EXAM</td><td>TBD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h4>Late Policy</h4><p>A late penalty of 25% per day will be applied (via Crowdmark) to any submissions after the deadline (for example, if your assignment is submitted 47 hours after the deadline, your grade will be calculated and then multiplied by 50%). Late penalties are applied to the entire assignment (not individual components/questions).</p><p>You must notify your instructor of any severe, long‐lasting problem that prevents you from doing an assignment and submit the current version of the Veriﬁcation of Illness form, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/health-services/sites/ca.health-services/files/uploads/files/VIFonline.pdf">https://uwaterloo.ca/health-services/sites/ca.health-services/files/uploads/files/VIFonline.pdf</a></p><p>Students using short‐term absence will be granted an extension to submit their assignments.</p><h4>Assignment Help</h4><p>Students may discuss general concepts and problems with other individuals in class. However, the solution that you submit must be worked throughby yourself and written in your own words. </p><p><br/>For each assignment, TAs are assigned to handle Piazza queries and office hours which will be posted on the class homepage. Students are encouraged to visit office hours offered by the instructor and <u>TAs</u>, and make use of Piazza. (Full or partial solutions may not be posted to Piazza so word your questions/answers accordingly.)</p><h4>Programming Languages: Python / Jupyter Notebooks</h4><p>The Python language has many libraries to support mathematical computing, including NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. We will use Jupyter notebooks, which provide a convenient, interactive web-based programming environment. You are expected to become comfortable working with Python and Jupyter.</p><p>You should start the first assignment as soon as possible to begin setting up and getting familiar with these tools. The Anaconda distribution is one convenient way to get set up, if you are installing Python/Jupyter on your own machine: <a href="https: //www.anaconda.com/distribution/">https: //www.anaconda.com/distribution/</a></p><p>The official Jupyter Notebook Quickstart guide is here: <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html">https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html </a><br/><br/>We will generally assume Python 3.5 or later.</p><p>There are many online sources of introductory material for working with Jupyter/Python. A useful introduction to Python with NumPy (for numerical computing) is here: <a href="https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/">https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/</a>. Some basic functionality may be covered/discussed as part of the course, and some example Notebooks may be made available on the course webpage to demonstrate particular features. <strong>However, it is ultimately your responsibility to get up to speed with the use of Jupyter notebooks. </strong>The focus of this course is on learning general mathematical and financial computing concepts, rather than a particular programming language.</p><p>The easiest way to use Jupyter notebooks is probably <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a>.</p><h4>Midterm</h4><p>The midterm is tentatively planned for <strong>Tuesday, March 4th, 05:30-07:20pm.</strong></p><p>Location: UW MC 4020, UW MC 4045</p><p>Format and more details will be announced later.</p><h4>Final Exam</h4><p>The Final Exam will be scheduled by the Registrar’s office. Students must inform the Registrar’s Office if they have a conflict in the final exam schedule, by the date posted on the Registrar’s website. Note that there is a precise definition of conflict as defined by the Registrar’s Office. The Registrar’s Office will then contact the course instructor to make alternate arrangements. Under no circumstances will the instructor make alternate arrangements for a final exam unless given instructions by the Registrar’s Office.</p><h4>Marking</h4><p>Assignment/midterm marks will be available on LEARN (or equivalent). Notify the instructor or a TA immediately if you believe a mark was recorded incorrectly. The marks recorded on LEARN are considered final two weeks after the grades are released for that specific assignment/midterm.</p><p>The assignments will consist of programming problems and analytical work. Your code and its output are an important part of the assignment, so they should be readable and well-commented. Likewise, assignment figures and graphs should be carefully thought out to present your data and conclusions in an effective and clear manner. Poor presentation of your work will result in a poor mark.</p><p>Any code and algorithms you write should be sufficiently well documented through code comments or descriptions to be readily understood. Matplotlib provides powerful plotting capabilities, which you should use to create figures/plots for your assignments; these plots should always be appropriately labelled for readability.</p><h4>Assignment/Midterm Marking Appeals</h4><p>If you feel your assignment/midterm was marked incorrectly, first write a clear explanation of specifically what you would like reviewed, and communicate this to the appropriate instructor or TA. The relevant contact person for a given assignment or question will be provided on LEARN. Requests for reviews of assignment/midterm marking must be submitted within one week from the time the assignments/midterm are returned. Also make sure you are absolutely certain about your remark request, as deduction after the remark request is a possibility.</p><h4>Plagiarism</h4><p>Plagiarism is representing the work of others as your own. Plagiarism on exams includes using unauthorized aids or communicating in any way with others during an examination. Plagiarism on assignments includes copying another student’s solution and submitting it as your own, allowing another student to copy your solution, collaborating excessively with another student, or obtaining solutions from any other source. See the section on Discipline below for typical penalties.</p><p>All academic offences are reported to the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies and are recorded in the student’s file. Subsequent academic offences in the same course or in other courses will lead to more severe penalties, up to and including suspension and expulsion.</p><p>We encourage you to discuss general concepts and problems with classmates, tutors, TAs, and the instructor. However, the solution that you submit must be worked through by yourself and written in your own words. It is not acceptable to work on an assignment with someone else and then write it up individually. The only exceptions are assignments or projects which the instructor designates as group activities. When discussing course matters, do not take notes, and do not look at another person’s partial solutions, or show them yours.</p><h4> </h4><p> </p>
