<div>CS 698:</div>
<p>This number is used for courses being offered on a temporary basis. Such a course may be available only once, for example to take advantage of a visiting professor's expertise, or may be offered experimentally until it is determined whether of not the course should become part of the regular course offerings. It may also be used for an individual study course carried out under the supervision of a Computer Science faculty member with the approval from the Associate Chair, Graduate Studies. This is a grade course. Preference will be given to CS graduate students.  All others require approval of the Department.</p>

<p>This course provides an introduction to building secure software applications. It examines the software development life cycle and teaches what developers can do in each step to make their software more secure. It also will cover common vulnerabilities that exist and how developers can avoid or safeguard against them.</p><p>Students completing this should be able to build and deploy software with fewer security issues.</p>
</div>

<h2>
  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Explain core security concepts (including the CIA triad, authentication, and authorization) and analyze the technical, psychological, and economic factors that contribute to security vulnerabilities in software systems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Apply secure design principles throughout the software development lifecycle, including threat modelling, architectural reviews, and cryptographic techniques, to create systems that are secure by design rather than through retrofitting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Identify, analyze, and mitigate common implementation-level vulnerabilities, including those related to access control, resource management, calculation errors, and improper input neutralization (such as SQL injection and XSS attacks).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Implement a comprehensive security testing strategy that combines multiple approaches (static analysis, runtime testing, fuzzing, and security scorecards) to effectively identify and validate security vulnerabilities throughout the development process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Explain secure deployment practices within a DevSecOps framework, including proper secrets management, secure configuration, and continuous monitoring, while maintaining system security through updates and incident response.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Evaluate and appropriately utilize modern development tools, including AI code generation tools, while understanding their security implications and implementing necessary safeguards to ensure the security of the resulting software.</td>

<div>
<h3>Assignment and Project Component deadlines</h3><p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you submit your assignment or project component correctly to LEARN before the deadline. The deadline is based on the time of day in Waterloo, Ontario (Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Time, depending on the time of year). The current date and time in Waterloo are always shown at the top-right of course web pages.</p><ul><li><strong>Late assignment submissions will not be accepted unless you have an accommodation </strong>(see below)<strong>.</strong></li><li><strong>Late project component submissions will never be accepted.</strong> We will not grant an extension because your team was not organized enough to know who was supposed to submit the work or because that person's internet connection failed at the crucial moment of submission. Be sure to submit well in advance and to exchange contact information in the event of an issue with a submission.</li></ul><h3>Accommodation Due to Illness</h3><h4>Missed Assignments</h4><ul><li>If you are unable to complete an assignment  because of illness, or other extenuating circumstances, submit appropriate documentation to Quest.<strong> There is no need to contact course staff for short extensions.</strong> We are notified daily of absences and at the discretion of the course staff, you will receive up to a two day extension.</li><li>Further information regarding Management of Requests for Accommodation Due to Illness can be found on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/accommodation-due-to-illness">Accommodation due to illness</a> page.</li></ul><h4>Missed Final Examination</h4><ul><li>If you are unable to write a final examination due to illness, seek medical treatment and have a medical practitioner complete a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic">Verification of Illness Form</a>. This should be submitted through Quest. You will be REQUIRED to hand in the completed form before you write a make-up examination.</li><li>After your completed Verification of Illness Form has been received and processed, you will be emailed your alternate exam date and time.

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
