<h4>Announcements</h4><p>All course announcements will be through <i>LEARN</i> (aka D2L) [<a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home/1098303">learn.uwaterloo.ca</a>], including the release of assignments with confirmed deadlines.</p><p>Students are expected to check for announcements frequently. <i>Pro Tip: </i>you may be interested in the <i>Brightspace Pulse</i> app [<a href="https://apps.brightspace.com/pulse/launch">link</a>] for your phone, which will push notifications from <i>LEARN </i>to your phone.</p><h4>Class and Lab Participation</h4><p>Class participation marks will be earned by completing activities in the classroom, participating in labs and providing feedback.</p><p>The participation marks will be structured so that a student that attends 75% of the lectures, attends and completes 75% of the labs, and completes all of the feedback will receive 100% in the class participation scheme.</p><p>In addition, some of the activities and/or feedback may be classified as bonus activities, which can be used to boost your class participation grade to exceed 100% (to a maximum of 150%).</p><h3>Labs</h3><p>The content in the labs will be a review of material from the previous week(s). Labs provide an opportunity to complete questions that will be similar to questions that will be asked on the assignments and the exams. Labs will only be graded for completion (not for correctness) and will only contribute to the participation grade.</p><h4>Assignment Submission</h4><p>Assignment submission is through <i>LEARN</i>, but may also involve uploading files to a personal website and/or submitting via <i>Crowdmark</i>.</p><h4>Assignment 0</h4><p>Assignment 0 is a bonus assignment, which will add 1% to your overall grade.</p><h4>Missed or Late Work</h4><p>There are <strong>5 grace days</strong> for students to use <strong>throughout the term</strong>. They may use them for any combination of assignments with a <strong>max of 2 per assignment</strong>.</p><p>Once the 5 grace days have been used, the there will be a -10% per day penalty. This penalty will not appear in <i>LEARN</i> but will be calculated in your final grade.</p><p><strong>Late assignments cannot be handed in any later than 48 hours after the deadline.</strong> For example, if an assignment is due  Monday night at 11:59 PM, then the latest an assignment will be accepted will be the Wednesday night at 11:59 PM.</p><h4>Self-Declared Absences and Illness (VIFs) </h4><p>A short-term VIF lasts for 2 days or less.</p><p><strong>If you submit a self-declared absence or a VIF, there is no need to notify course staff (we automatically receive a notification from Quest).</strong></p><p>For class participation, there will be <strong>no accommodation</strong> for self-declared absences and VIFs. The 75% participation rate already accounts for such circumstances.</p><p>For assignments, there will be <strong>no accommodation</strong> for self-declared absences and short-term VIFs. The grace days already account for such circumstances. For a long-term VIF, the assignment will be excused, and the other assignments will be re-weighted accordingly.</p><p>For the midterm, the weight of your midterm will be shifted to the final exam.</p><h4>Other Extenuating Circumstances</h4><p>Students that have any other extenuating circumstances with appropriate documentation should contact the course staff [Barbara Daly: <a href="mailto:bmzister@uwaterloo.ca">bmzister@uwaterloo.ca</a>] for appropriate accommodation.</p><h4>Assignment Remarking Policy</h4><p>Students must document why they are requesting a remark and must do so no later than 2 weeks after the assignment has been handed back. Send remark requests to the ISAs [<a href="mailto:cs100@uwaterloo.ca">cs100@uwaterloo.ca</a>].</p><h4>MS Teams</h4><p>An <i>MS Team</i> [<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ADMWJrxIrhxMVxVpTeq4r5lyLaCAsmzIuUQP4AULmpts1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=171092bb-962c-465a-bd81-888680951179&amp;tenantId=723a5a87-f39a-4a22-9247-3fc240c01396">link</a>] has been created for students to ask questions related to the course, assignments and concepts outside of office hours.</p><p>Please use the "Questions and Answers" channel, not the General channel.</p><p>Official announcements will not be made via MS Teams. All important information will be posted on <i>LEARN</i>.</p><h4>Website</h4><p>The course website [<a href="https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs100/">student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs100/</a>] may be used to provide information or content that is not easily provided in <i>LEARN</i>.</p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Group Work and Collaboration</h4><p>Unless otherwise specified, assignments are to be completed individually and without assistance (aside from course staff). Students are free to use the Internet to better understand material (and some assignments will explicitly require some use of the Internet), but all assignment solutions are to be the work of the individual and in their own words. </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>The use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
