<div>
<p>In order to receive a passing grade in this course, students must earn a grade of at least 45% on the final exam. Any student obtaining a grade less than 45% on the final exam will be given a failing grade, regardless of performance in the rest of the course.</p><h4>Participation</h4><p>Participation will be graded with a number of surveys taken during the term. Students may also provide course feedback for bonus marks. Details will be given during the term.</p><h4>Concept Checks</h4><p>Concept Checks are questions scattered within the modules on edX. Students may work with other students on them but must each individually submit their answer. We will drop the lowest 10% of your concept checks.</p><h4>Quizzes</h4><p>Every module will end with a quiz on edX. Quizzes are to be completed by the module deadline. We will drop the lowest scoring quiz at the end of the term. All quizzes must be done individually by students, without collaboration except from course staff.</p><h4>Assignments</h4><p>There will be 8 assignments, consisting primarily of programming questions. All assignments must be done individually by students, without collaboration except from course staff. Absolutely no late assignment submissions are permitted.</p><h4>Final Project </h4><p>There will be one Final Project due at the end of the term. </p><h4>Exams</h4><p>There is an in-person Final Exam. </p><h4>Remarking</h4><p>If you have problems with the marking of an assignment, please contact the course ISAs within two weeks of the date the assignment's mark was made available on LEARN. The email must include your name, student number, Quest user ID, and assignment number. We also require that you list the questions you feel were marked incorrectly, and, for each of those questions, why you feel your mark should be changed. Please be aware that the assignment will be remarked in its entirety.</p><h4>Missed Course Components</h4><p>With appropriate, authorized documentation (provided via a Verification of Illness Form, self declaration, accessability accommodation, etc), assignments may be excused based upon the course ISC's decision. Please contact the course ISC to see if this applies. If a missed assignment is excused, its weight may be shifted to the final exam. In the interest of understanding the course material for future assignments and exams, students who miss work are encouraged to complete it anyway, and submit it for feedback from the course ISAs.  You cannot miss more than 3 assignments over the term and still get credit for the course.</p><h4>Late Course Work</h4><p>Any course components submitted late will receive no credit; consequently, you should aim to finish early, to allow for unexpected delays. After an assignment due date has passed, you may still submit your work for feedback only (no marks) to the course ISAs by email and request for feedback.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  MOSS (Measure of Software Similarities) is used in this course as a means of comparing current students' assignments as well as comparing with past comparing students’ assignments and code on the internet, to ensure academic integrity. We will report suspicious activity, and penalties for plagiarism (i.e. cheating) are severe. Please read the available information about academic integrity very carefully.<br/><br/>Group work is disallowed unless otherwise specified. Any excessive collaboration will be treated as a violation of academic integrity. You are responsible for writing all the code in your assignments and other assessments. You may not receive code from anybody else, whether by email, by copying-and-pasting, by dictation, by having them type it into your Open Processing IDE, or by any other means. When working on assignments, please do not show your code to other students, or allow them to see it accidentally. You can discuss assignment problems in general terms, and perhaps work together on strategies for solving them, but do not go so far as to develop code in pairs or groups.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
