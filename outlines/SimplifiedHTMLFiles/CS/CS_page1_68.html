<p>It is expected that students complete the required assignments and take all quizzes and exams. Any material presented in lectures will be examinable unless specifically noted.</p><p><strong>Assignments</strong><br/>There will be four homework assignments, and four quizzes. Each homework assignment or quiz will test the material taught in the most recent lectures. Homework assignments and quizzes will be posted on LEARN, must be submitted on LEARN, and will be marked on LEARN. <strong>Late submissions / retakes / exemptions will not be accepted</strong>.</p><p>There will also be two more programming assignments. While the assignments are fairly large, you will have one month to complete each. Try not to leave these until the last minute. Programming assignments are to be returned by the provided due dates. In the case of illness or extraordinary circumstances, <strong>a verification of illness (VIF) must be submitted,</strong> and a 10% penalty will apply for each 24 hours late submission up to a maximum of 72 hours of the assignment deadline. No further extension will be granted. Programming assignments will be posted on LEARN, must be submitted on LEARN, and will be marked on LEARN.</p><p>Programming assignments should be completed individually. We will compare all handed-in assignments to each other to check for undocumented collaboration.</p><p><strong>Midterm and Final Exam</strong><br/>The Midterm Exam is tentatively scheduled on <strong>Monday</strong>,<strong> Feb 24, 2025, Time: 2:30 - 3:50 PM</strong><br/>The Final Exam will be scheduled by the Registrar's Office.</p><p>Midterm and Final have to be passed, in the aggregate, in order to pass the course; i.e.,: <strong>[(Midterm*25) + (Final*35)] / 60 &gt;= 0.5</strong></p><p>In case of a <strong>missed</strong> exam, a VIF must be uploaded to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/vif-submission">university's online portal</a>. The certificate or doctor's note MUST include the statement "This Student is unable to write the exam on (date) for (medical reasons)". The documentation MUST show that the physician was consulted before or on the day of the exam. Only ORIGINAL copies can be accepted. A statement merely confirming a report of illness made by the student is NOT acceptable.</p><p>All examinations will be closed books.</p><p><strong>Continuity of Education Plan</strong><br/>Reduced weights for Midterm and Final exams if they are to be conducted online:<br/>Midterm Exam: 20%<br/>Final Exam: 25%<br/>Note that if any exam has to be scheduled online, the remaining portion of the grade for the online exam will be proportionally spread across the remaining components (i.e., assignments and quizzes, where applicable).</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Plagiarism</strong><br/>A programming assignment is an individual creative process. Individuals must reach their own understanding of the problem and discover a path to its solution. During this time, discussions with friends are encouraged. However, when the time comes to write the code that solves the problem, such discussions are no longer appropriate; the program must be your own work.</p><p>Do not, under any circumstances, copy another person's program. This includes relevant web sources. Writing code for use by another or using another's code in any form is academic fraud and will be dealt with harshly. You are also responsible for ensuring that the code you write for the assignments is not readable by others.</p><p><strong>Marking Appeals</strong><br/>Assignment appeals should be directed to the TA who marked the assignment. Exam appeals need to be submitted in writing to the instructor. The whole exam will be remarked.</p><p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains material that is the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/>● Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>● Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>● Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, midterm and final exams); and<br/>● Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent). Read Policy 73 - Intellectual Property Rights.</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
