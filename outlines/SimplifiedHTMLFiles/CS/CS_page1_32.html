<p>This course is designed for non-CS students who are interested in continuing their study of computer science beyond first year</p><p>The course introduces information systems and their strategic role in business. Topics include types of information systems, organizational requirements, systems development strategies, decision support systems, data and information management, and information systems manage- ment, control and implementation.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the course.<br/><br/><strong>Note: A detailed (official) course outline is published in LEARN at the beginning of the term and is also available from the instructor. This site (outline.uwaterloo.ca) summarizes selected key points found in the official course outline. There is additional information in the official outline that may not  be described on this site.  If you are enrolled in CS330-003 be sure to use the official (detailed) version of the outline as your reference for policies and expectations. </strong></p><h3>Course Website</h3><p>The course website (in LEARN) contains vital information regarding the course. It is your responsibility to regularly visit the course website.</p><p>I make extensive use of the ANNOUNCEMENTS feature and the ASK THE INSTRUCTOR discussion forum to communicate important information.</p><p><i>Information posted to LEARN is information you are expected to know.

  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>

</div>
<div>
<p>The course has the following learning objectives:</p><ol><li>To gain an understanding of basic concepts related to the design and of information systems in business and other settings.</li><li>To understand of the impact (detrimental and beneficial) that information systems play in supporting (possibly even determining) the strategic direction of modern organizations.</li><li>Be familiar with emerging issues facing organizations as they seek to exploit the power of information technology.</li></ol><p> </p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Thematic Topics</strong></p><p>Module content is delivered using a collection of video lectures with a set of accompanying printable slides. Both can be found in LEARN, organised by lecture.</p><p>These are the some of the topics we will explore this term:</p><ul><li>IT Infrastructure<ul><li><i>All the parts that make IT work</i></li></ul></li><li>Trends and Technology Drivers<ul><li><i>What’s driving change?</i></li></ul></li><li>Databases<ul><li><i>Organising data to mine information</i></li></ul></li><li>Networks<ul><li><i>Connecting stuff together</i></li></ul></li><li>Management Information Systems<ul><li><i>How businesses use computers</i></li></ul></li><li>Business Processes<ul><li><i>The business of running a business</i></li></ul></li><li>Organisations and IS<ul><li><i>The human side of MIS</i></li></ul></li><li>Social, Ethical and Legal Issues<ul><li><i>Why privacy, security, IP, all matter</i></li></ul></li><li>Managing Knowledge<ul><li><i>How knowledge gets shared</i></li></ul></li></ul><p>The recorded lectures were created from a previous live class offering and thus the videos are based on how on-campus lectures work where we can stop at any point and then pick up again the next day.</p><p>For online courses, we would normally create videos that cover a complete topic rather than a block of time. So we’ve got a bit of a challenge ahead of us as I try to adapt “campus lectures” (what we have) for “online” (what we are) use. But working together, we’ll figure it out.</p><p>It is complex enough though that I’m not going to try to present a schedule of days and topics here in the outline. For each module you will find a START HERE page in LEARN. The START HERE page helps you focus on concepts that are important to grasp, readings you should complete, slides you should pay attention to (and maybe some slides you can skip over), tasks to complete, etc.</p><p>Watch the video called “So Many Videos, So Many Slides” to better understand where to place your focus when following long with the slides and videos.</p><p> </p>

<div>
<p>There are some rules that are common to many CS courses with respect to final grades.</p><p>Note these carefully:</p><ol><li>In order to pass the course you must earn an overall course grade of at least 50% using the allocation algorithm above AND</li><li>You must have earned a grade of at least 50% on the combined score of your midterm + final.</li></ol><p>In situations where either of these conditions are not met, the grade awarded will be 46% or less – irrespective of the mathematical result obtained using the grade allocation algorithm above.</p><p>Your final grade is determined using the breakdown above but can be affected (upwards ordownwards) by the Effort Adjustment Factor. The Effort Adjustment Factor is used in lieu of having a participation grade.</p><p>Watch the video on how the Effort Adjustment Factor works. The video can be found in the IMPORTANT COURSE INFORMATION folder in LEARN.</p><p><i>I find it helpful to remind everyone that online learning does not mean independent study. This is not a course where you can decide what to do, how much to do, and when to do it. Everyone in the class, including me, is counting on your involvement.</i></p><p><strong>Details on the deliverables that contribute to your evaluation are described in the detailed course outline. Below are mainly due dates:</strong></p><h3>Self-tests (Quizzes) (12 quizzes = 8% total)</h3><p>The self-tests are short and are intended to be easy if you have completed the related readings and tasks. Self-tests are completed inside LEARN and can be found under SUBMIT &gt;&gt; QUIZZES.</p><p>Self-tests are due Monday at 23h59 in the week that follows the related online lecture. This means the quiz for lectures during week 1 is due on the Monday of week 2, etc.</p><h3>Course Outline Quiz (2%)</h3><p>There is a course outline quiz that is designed to ensure you are familiar with the course structure a nd is due on the Monday of Week 2 at 23h59. (13 Jan 2025)</p><h3>Individual Thinking Tasks (20% - 2 at 10% each)</h3><p>There are 2 individual thinking tasks. These usually involve solving a problem of some type. Each is to be completed individually. The due dates are:</p><ul><li>Task1 – Wed 05 Feb 2025 at 23h59 EST</li><li>Task2 – Mon 24 Feb 2025 at 23h59 EST</li></ul><p>We will use Crowdmark to manage submissions for the individual thinking tasks.</p><h3>Group Activity Task (15%)</h3><p>Your group will develop a business plan for a strategic information system. I will post more information about this activity after you have watched the lecture on Strategic Information Systems. (Occurs in Week 2.) 2/3rds of your grade for this task will be awarded by me. The other 1/3 will be awarded by others in the class. (So each group will not only create a business plan, each of you will have the chance to evaluate a business plan created by another group.)</p><p>The due dates are:</p><ul><li>Group Submission – Fri Mar 14 2025 at 23h59</li><li>Evaluation Due – Fri Mar 28 2025 at 23h59</li></ul><h3>Midterm + Final (20% midterm/35% final)</h3><p>The midterm is scheduled for Thursday March 6, 2025 from 19h00 – 20h50 EST and can be completed online.</p><p>If you are unable to write the midterm for acceptable reasons, your final exam score will be used as your midterm score. (There is no make-up midterm exam.)</p><p>The final exam will be held in person. The examination date and room location will be announced by the Registrar when the Registrar posts the exam period details for the term.</p><p><strong>The final exam for this course will be held on the Waterloo campus – NOT in Stratford. You must attend in person to write the final exam in Waterloo.</strong></p><p>Remember, never to make personal plans (like buying an airplane ticket) until after the examination schedule is released by the Registrar. Regrettably, the University does not accept a Caribbean holiday (or even your cousin’s friend’s sister’s wedding) as an acceptable reason to miss a final examination.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (such as Turnitin) may be used to screen assignments. Turnitin has been tweaked to assess whether ChatGPI or other AI tools appear to have been used in the preparation of written text.<br/><br/>Contact me if you wish to explore an alternate process for screening your submissions.
</p>
<a></a>
<h2>
  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>This course includes the opportunity to join a live video session held during a scheduled tutorial slot in your timetable.</p><p>Whereas in a classroom you have a bit of anonymity, the technology needed to allow streaming video strips some of that away. As a professor who teaches our security and privacy courses, I’m sensitive to the potential impact.</p><p>To respect the privacy rights of those attending, I will not be recording our live sessions. Nor should you. (Just as you shouldn’t be recording a live lecture without the instructor’s permission.)</p><p>The university has adopted a code of practice regarding live video which you can read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/privacy/policies-guidelines/privacy-and-remote-teaching-and-learning#:%7E:text=You%20will%20receive%20notification%20of,also%20provide%20a%20recording%20indicator.">here</a>. The code of practice describes the options available to you designed to respect any particular need for privacy that you may have. Pay particular attention to the Notice of Recording that appears as an Appendix in the code of practice.</p><p>Please speak with me directly so that I can help accommodate any specific needs that you may have with respect to synchronous classes.</p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3><strong>Equity, Diversity and Inclusivity</strong></h3><p>I welcome and embrace diversity in opinions, backgrounds and beliefs, and count on you to do the same. </p><p>Demonstrate respect and dignity towards others in the class, as I know you will.</p><p>If you have a PGP that you prefer I use, I welcome you sharing if you wish to. My PGP is he/him/his.</p><p>For some of us, the name stored in the university’s records is sometimes not the name by which our family and friends know us. Should you have a preferred name, simply let me know. We’ll happily update our class list to reflect that choice.</p><p>Please also help me correctly pronounce your name should I say it incorrectly. Many of us have names that don’t follow English pronunciation patterns. My name is a good example. You would think my name (Ian) is pronounced “eye-an” as the “i” is followed by a vowel meaning by English pronunciation rules, it should be a “long” <i>i</i>, but my name is pronounced as, “eee-an.” (I just smile when people call me “eye-an.”)</p><p>While many of you will have heard my name before and will know how it is pronounced, unless you speak Gaelic (I’m from Scotland) I bet nobody in the class can pronounce other names in my family. My siblings and I have spent our lives helping teachers learn how to pronounce our names (and spelling our names, letter by letter, when talking to a call centre!), so I totally understand. Please help me learn how to correctly pronounce your name should I say it incorrectly. I love learning new names.</p><p>I am happy to honour your religious holidays and celebrations. Should any of these events interfere with expectations I’ve presented in this outline, please speak with me at the beginning of the term.</p><h3><strong>Security Information</strong></h3><p>In this course, you may be exposed to information about security problems and vulnerabilities with computing systems and networks. You are not to use this or any other similar information to test the security of, break into, compromise, or otherwise attack, any system or network without the express consent of the owner. Depending upon the scenario, attempting any of these actions could be considered not only unethical behavior but also criminal behavior. In particular, you will comply with all applicable laws and UW policies, including, but not limited to, the following:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33">UW Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</a></li><li><a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infocist/use.htm">Guidelines on Use of UW Computing and Network Resources</a></li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math-faculty-computing-facility/policies/usage-policies">MFCF Account Usage Policy</a></li><li><a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/cscf/policies/">CSCF-Specific Policies</a></li></ul><p>Violations will be treated severely, and with zero tolerance.</p><h3><strong>The Land We Are On</strong></h3><p>On our main campus we are living and working on the traditional territory of the Attawandaron (also known as Neutral), Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes ten kilometres on each side of the Grand River.</p><p>At Stratford we live and work on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, and Ojibway/Chippewa peoples. This territory is covered by the Upper Canada Treaties.</p><h3><strong>Mental Health</strong></h3><p>If you or anyone you know experiences academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, you are strongly encouraged to seek support. There are many resources available.</p><p>On-campus Resources:</p><ul><li>Campus Wellness<br/>https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</li><li>Counselling Services: counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca<br/>519-888-4567 ext. 32655<br/>Needles Hall North 2nd floor, (NH 2401)</li><li>MATES<br/>One-to-one peer support program offered by Federation of Students (FEDS) and Counselling Services<br/>mates@uwaterloo.ca</li><li>Health Services service<br/>Located across the creek from Student Life Centre, 519-888-4096.</li></ul><p>Off-campus Resources:</p><ul><li>Good2Talk (24/7)<br/>Free confidential help line for post-secondary students.<br/>1-866- 925-5454</li><li>Here 24/7<br/>Mental Health and Crisis Service Team<br/>1-844-437-3247</li><li>OK2BME<br/>Support services for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or questioning teens in Waterloo.<br/>519-884-0000, extension 213</li></ul><p><strong>More administrative policies can be found under "The fine print" section of the detailed course outline.</strong></p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
