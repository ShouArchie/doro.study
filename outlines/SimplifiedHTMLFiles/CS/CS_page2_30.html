<ul><li>Graduate students have the same scheme, but have additional assignment questions</li><li>Assignments are submitted via Crowdmark.</li><li>Assignments often include some coding questions (implementing an algorithm, etc). You may use a programming language of your choice (python, R C, C++, Matlab,. . . ).</li><li>Your Crowdmark submission must include all code and relevant output; code must be reasonably well commented.</li><li>You are allowed to discuss assignments with other students in the class, but your discussion should remain verbal only and you should not share/show code, solution writeups, or any written work related to the assignment. In particular, make sure you write your assignment solutions (text, code, presentation of numerical results or graphs, etc) on your own. Please also carefully read the information found at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/academic-matters/academic-integrity">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/academic-matters/academic-integrity</a> to ensure you know how to avoid academic offenses.</li><li>Please check your seat for the midterms on Odyssey shortly before the midterm.</li></ul><p><strong>Midterm dates:</strong></p><ul><li>Midterm 1: Feb 11, 7:00pm - 8:30pm (see seat on Odyssey)</li><li>Midterm 2: March 27, 7:00pm - 8:30pm (see seat on Odyssey)</li></ul><p><strong>Tentative Assignment due dates (11:59pm on that day):</strong></p><ul><li>February 9</li><li>March 2</li><li>March 23</li><li>April 6</li></ul><p><i>Note: The first weeks will be spent on introducing some basics of financial markets/financial mathematics.

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  No assignment screening will be used in this course.

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Missed assessment policy</strong></p><p><i>Assignments:</i> Given that there are at least 7 days to solve the assignment, unless prior arrangements are made or extenuating circumstances are documented, no late assignments will be accepted and a grade of zero will be awarded. Any arrangements for extenuating circumstances are at the discretion of the instructor.</p><p><i>Midterms </i>If you miss a midterm due to illness or other reasons, you must inform your Instructor within 48 hours. If proper documentation is provided (VIF, self-declared absence, . . . ), usually a make-up examination will take place at a time mutually agreed-upon. It is at the instructor’s discretion wether this examination is oral or written. Only in the most extenuating circumstances will the weight of a missed midterm be distributed over the remaining midterms, which is also at the instructor's discretion.</p><p><strong>Regrading policy</strong></p><p>Requests for regrading a document must be made within 7 days after the document has been returned to you. To have your document considered for regrading you must formulate a request in writing by email to the instructor, providing the problem and a reason for why you believe it should be regraded. Your entire document may then be regraded and, in case necessary, your original mark raised or lowered. Keep in mind that if a problem has been graded consistently for all students, it is unlikely that changes for a particular student can be made as this would make grading unfair towards the other students.</p><p><strong>The importance of practice: </strong>Being a mathematician (in the wider sense; you could be a probabilist, statistician, financial analyst, actuarial scientist etc.) is, to a large degree, not different from being a mechanic. A mechanic encounters a problem, analyzes it, and fixes it with the tools from her/his toolbox. Mathematics is the same, just our ‘tools’ are results we have previously derived or learned about: Our hammer is the Central Limit Theorem, our screwdriver the Strong Law of Large Numbers, our drilling machine is Monte Carlo simulation etc. . . . you get the idea. The computer we use to simulate a result is also one of our tools. Now the whole goal is to fill up your toolbox. If you then encounter a new problem, you analyze it, open your toolbox, see what tools you have and apply what works best – just as a mechanic. But if you open your toolbox and there are only few tools in there, you don’t have many options. . . that’s why we work on filling that toolbox in the course, and the practice questions are simply the ‘problems’ you may encounter. And to become a good mechanic, you need a good toolbox plus practice in using it (doesn’t help if you have a thousand tools with you but you don’t know how to use any of them. . . ).</p><p>Thus, work on the practice problems! If you don’t try them and wait for the solution to be presented in class, you look at it and say ‘okay, that sounds reasonable, I would have probably come up with the same idea’. But then you forget about that idea because it didn’t take you any effort to understand. On the other hand, if you tried to find a solution by yourself, you will always remember that point where you got stuck and which was challenging for you. And once you see the solution, you have this aha-effect saying ‘aha, I see, this is what I was missing’. Because of this effect, you will remember that idea/trick in the future, in particular also in an exam. So do try the practice problems alone (if it helps you, set a time limit before starting to ask others). Also, obviously, do look at the solutions after being made available to make sure you learn the underlying ideas and tricks how to approach the problems.</p><p><strong>INC policy: </strong>A grade of INC is awarded to a student who has done course work during the term well enough that they could reasonably be expected to earn a passing mark in the course, but, was unable to complete end-of-term course requirements (usually the final exam) for reasons beyond their control. It is at the instructor's discretion wether a student is eligible for an INC. If a student is not passing the class going into the final exam, it is unlikely that they will be granted an INC. See https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/incomplete-procedure.</p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><p> </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
