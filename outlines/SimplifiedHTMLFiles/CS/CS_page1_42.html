<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>The following policies establish expectations for how this course will be managed. Your responsibilities are outlined here, so you should take time to review them carefully.</p><h2>Grading Policies</h2><p>Quizzes are marked automatically by Learn, and course grades are released by 10:00 AM the Monday after the quiz is written.</p><p>Other materials are manually graded by TAs. Grades are normally returned within 1 week of the due date.</p><p>Regrade requests for any graded materials will ONLY be considered for one week after the grade has been released; we will not entertain last-minute regrade requests. If you wish to dispute a grade, email the instructor (for quizzes) or your TA (for project submissions). Contact information is <a href="https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs346/1249/course-outline/contact-us/">here</a>.</p><p>Grading is conducted based on how the material was taught in-class i.e. the instructors presentation of these topics. We will NOT regrade based on other sources e.g. your CS 348 course notes, your past work term experience, a blog post you found on the Internet.</p><h2>Team Formation</h2><p>You are expected to form project teams in the first couple of weeks. The following guidelines apply:</p><ul><li><strong>Students are responsible for matching up and forming teams</strong>. Teams must be formed by the end of the second week (i.e. the add-course deadline). If you fail to find a team, you must inform the instructor by this deadline.</li><li><strong>We do not guarantee you a team after the end of the second week</strong>. If you have not joined a team, and have not made some arrangement with the instructor, you may be required to withdraw from the course.</li><li><strong>Course enrolment will be managed by the instructor</strong> to encourage teams of four students. If necessary, the instructor may authorize larger or smaller teams, or modify team membership to accommodate everyone that is enrolled in the course.</li></ul><h2>Course Participation</h2><p>You are expected to participate in the course project to the best of your ability.</p><ul><li><strong>You must be able to attend class with your team</strong>. You are not allowed to take this course remotely, or while on a work term that prevents you from attending in-person. If you attempt to take this course remotely, you may be required to withdraw from the course.</li><li><strong>If you fail to participate, you may be removed from the course</strong>. This may be done at any time prior to the start of the "Drop with WD" period. See the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/important-dates">Important dates</a> calendar for specific term dates.</li></ul><h2>Illness and Absences</h2><h3>Self-Declaration</h3><p>If you test positive for COVID-19 or have COVID-symptoms, you are required to use the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-my-illness-isolation">COVID-19 self-declaration form</a>. If you are ill but do not meet the COVID-19 self-declaration guidelines, you should instead follow the guidelines and steps outlined in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations">Math Accommodations page</a>.</p><p>In either case, you should <a href="mailto:jeffery.avery@uwaterloo.ca">contact the instructor via email</a>. You should also inform your team members, so they can make appropriate arrangements.</p><h3>Short-Term Absences</h3><p>You cannot use a short-term absence (STA) to delay a team deliverable. You may use a STA for an exemption on a quiz. In this case, you would be expected to <a href="mailto:jeffery.avery@uwaterloo.ca">contact the instructor</a> within 24h of the deadline by using the <a href="https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs346/cgi-bin/extension/absence.cgi">online CS 346 declaration form</a>. You must also fill in the Math <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations/submission"><u>Short-Term Absence</u></a> form.</p><h2>Inclusiveness</h2><p>It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives are well-served by this course, and that student's learning needs be addressed both in and out of class. We recognize the immense value of the diversity in identities, perspectives, and contributions that students bring, and the benefit it has on our educational environment. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In particular:</p><ul><li>We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternate/preferred name or pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the term, so we may make appropriate changes to our records.</li><li>We will honour your religious holidays and celebrations. Please inform us of these at the start of the course.</li><li>We will follow AccessAbility Services guidelines and protocols on how to best support students with different learning needs.</li></ul><h2>Academic Integrity</h2><p>To maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. Contact the <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/">Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.</p><p>You are expected to follow the policies outlined here for quiz and project submissions.</p><p>To ensure academic integrity, MOSS (Measure of Software Similarities) is used in this course as a means of comparing student projects. We will report suspicious activity, and penalties for plagiarism/cheating are severe. Please read the available information about academic integrity very carefully.</p><h3>Ethical Behaviour</h3><p>Students are expected to act professionally, and engage one another in a respectful manner at all times. This expectation extends to working together in project teams. Harassment or other forms of personal attack will not be tolerated. Course staff will <i>not</i> referee interpersonal disputes on a project team; incidents will be dealt with according to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33">Policy 33</a>.</p><h3>Plagiarism and Third-Party Code</h3><p>Students are expected to either work on their own (in the case of quizzes), or work with a project team (for the remaining deliverables in the course). All work submitted should either be their own original work or work created by the team for this course.</p><p>The team is also allowed to use third-party source code or libraries for their project under these specific conditions:</p><ul><li>Published third-party libraries in binary form may be used without restriction. This may include libraries for networking, user interfaces and other libraries that are introduced in class.</li><li>Source code from external sources may only be used if the contribution is less than 25 lines of code from a single source. Code copied in this way must be acknowledged with a comment embedded directly in your source code in the appropriate section.</li><li>All external sources (libraries and source code) should be identified in the project's README file.</li></ul><p>Failure to acknowledge a source will result in a significant penalty to your final project grade (ranging from a minor deduction to a grade of zero for the project, depending on the severity of the infraction). Note that MOSS will be used to compare student assignments, and that this rule also applies to copying from other student projects, source code found online, or projects from previous terms of this course.</p><h3>Reuse of Materials</h3><p>You cannot base your project in part or in whole on course-work that you have completed for a different course. You cannot submit the same project to multiple courses for credit, even if you are taking the courses concurrently (i.e. CS 346 and CS 446 would require different projects to be submitted that do not share source code).</p><p>Similarly, you cannot use anything that you created prior to the start of this course without explicit written permission from the instructor. This includes code, documentation, and other materials that you may have created in previous courses or work terms, or materials that you have created on your own time.</p><h3>Generative AI &amp; LLMs</h3><p>The use of Generative AI and/or Large Language Models (e.g., ChatGPT, CoPilot and similar systems) is restricted in this course. You are not allowed to use such systems when writing quizzes, or for generating any part of your written submission (e.g., design document, user instructions, final report).</p><p>You <i>are</i> allowed to use these tools to generate a limited amount of code towards your project, if you adhere to the policies described above under <a href="https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs346/1249/course-outline/policies/#plagiarism-and-third-party-code">plagiarism</a>. Content generated by these systems must be treated as a source and cited properly, just like any other third-party source, and you are limited in how much generated code can be used.</p><p>Improper use of these tools will be <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/artificial-intelligence-and-chatgpt">subject to Policy 71 and an investigation into academic misconduct</a>.</p><p>Note that if you use these types of systems to generate code, you are responsible for the consequences. These models can (and often do) generate incorrect and illogical code. Non-working generated code will not be an acceptable excuse for failing to meet project requirements or deadlines.</p><h3>Student Discipline</h3><p>A student is expected to know <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/">what constitutes academic integrity</a> to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate Associate Dean.</p><p>For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p><h2>Intellectual Property</h2><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policies/policy-73-intellectual-property-rights">intellectual property of their instructor</a>, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof)</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides)</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams), and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository). Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><h2>Continuity Plan</h2><p>As part of the University’s Continuity of Education Plan, every course should be designed with a plan that considers alternate arrangements for cancellations of classes and/or exams.</p><p>Here is how we will handle cancellations in this course, if they occur.</p><p>In the case of minor disruptions (e.g. one lecture), the lecture content will be reorganized to fit the remaining time. This should not have any impact on demos or deliverables.</p><p>Cancellation of multiple classes <i>may</i> result in a reduction in the number of sprints and associated deliverables to fit the remaining time. If this happens, lecture content will also be pruned to fit available time. Assessment weights will be redistributed evenly over the remaining content if required to align with the material.</p><p>Cancellation of in-person (midterm or final) examinations has no effect on this course, since we do not have scheduled exams and quizzes are online.</p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
