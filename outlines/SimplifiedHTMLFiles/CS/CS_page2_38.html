<p>This course introduces students to the design of algorithms that enable machines to ``learn,'' as well as some of their significant impacts on society. In contrast to the classic paradigm where machines are programmed by specifying a set of instructions that dictate what exactly a machine should do, a new paradigm is developed whereby machines are presented with examples from which they learn what to do. This is especially useful in complex tasks such as natural language processing, information retrieval, data mining, computer vision and robotics where it is not practical for a programmer to enumerate all possible situations in order to specify suitable instructions for all situations. Instead, a machine is fed with a large collection of examples from which it automatically learns suitable rules to follow.</p><p>The course will introduce the basics of machine learning and data analysis, and demonstrate how machine learning techniques have impacted life and society. The course starts with some classical tasks and algorithms in machine learning, then transitions to modern advances and successful applications in real life, and finally ends with discussions on the societal impact that machine learning has generated. As machine learning becomes increasingly popular in practice and starts to penetrate into critical areas such as law, health care, scarce resource allocation, autonomous driving, elections, etc., various ethical and safety issues have been discovered. A significant part of the course will be devoted to raising students' awareness on such ethical issues, including how to make machine learning algorithms fair and unbiased, how to protect individual privacy without compromising learning, how machine learning algorithms might be attacked, how to measure and improve the security of machine learning algorithms, and how to make machine learning algorithms explainable and interpretable.</p>

<p>Assignments will be submitted through Crowdmark or Learn. </p><p>It is OK to seek for help, but you must write your solutions independently and individually, and you should always acknowledge any help you get (book, friend, internet, ChatGPT, etc.). </p><p>We do NOT accept any late homework submissions (even if you are 1 second late), unless you have a legitimate reason with formal proof (e.g. hospitalization, family urgency, etc.) and notify the instructor in time. Traveling, busy with other stuff, internet connections, having a bad day, or simply forgetting to submit, are not considered legitimate.</p><p>Mark appeals should be requested within two weeks of receiving the mark.</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
