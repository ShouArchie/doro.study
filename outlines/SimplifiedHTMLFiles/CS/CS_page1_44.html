<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h2>General Assignment Policies</h2><p>Specific submission policies are listed on each assignment. The following policies apply to every assignment.</p><ul><li>You are expected to develop on your own machine (Windows, MacOS, and Linux are all supported). You <i>should</i> conform to the tools and versions specified in the assignment description.</li><li>All submissions <i>must</i> made be via your Git repository. Assignments submitted by any other method (e.g., email) will not be graded.</li><li>All required source code, assets (e.g., images and sound files) <i>must</i> be submitted for each assignment. <strong>If the TAs cannot run or build your submitted solution, you </strong><i><strong>may</strong></i><strong> receive a grade of 0%. Details on how a particular assignment should build are included in the assignment description.</strong></li><li>Assignments will be graded, and grades posted on LEARN approximately one week after the submission deadline. An announcement will be made on Piazza indicating how to access your grade. Remark requests for assignments <i>must</i> be received within one week of the grades being announced. After this, remark requests <i>may not</i> be granted.</li></ul><h2>Late Submissions</h2><p>You are expected to commit your assignment solution to your repository before the posted deadline.</p><ul><li>Late assignments will be deducted 10% per 24 hour period up to 48 hours (i.e. 10% deduction if committed 0 to 24 hours after deadline, 20% deduction if committed 24 to 48 hours after deadline).</li><li>Late assignments committed more than 48 hours after the deadline will receive a grade of 0.</li><li><i>If you commit an assignment after the assignment deadline by mistake</i>: you must email the course ISC (<a href="https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs349/1241/#ISC">Caroline Kierstead</a>) so they can notify TAs to mark the version submitted before the deadline. Otherwise, late penalties will be deducted or you could even receive 0.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Please do not expect course staff to answer Piazza posts about an assignment after the deadline has passed.</p></blockquote><h2>Out-of-scope Language Features</h2><p>In principle, there's no restriction on using JavaScript or TypeScript language features not covered by the course, <i>unless they're described in the assignment restrictions.</i> But note all required language features needed for an assignment are covered in lectures and demos.  By "features not covered by the course" we're referring to something like ES6 Sets or TypeScript generics, not additional methods for a feature we cover already (like the CanvasRenderingContext2D).</p><p>If you choose to use features not covered by the course, be aware:</p><ol><li>We won't help you with issues related to those features in office hours or on Piazza.</li><li>TAs may not be familiar with those features, so we strongly recommend you add some explanation to your README to justify why you use them and provide some background about how they relate to the features we do cover. For example, what is the advantage of using Set over an Object or Array? (this is to avoid losing marks and having to file a remark request later).</li><li>Using those features will attract additional scrutiny of your source code for potential assignment requirement violations, plagiarism, and un-documented use of GenAI. So in addition, consider:</li></ol><p>(a) you need to make absolutely certain those features don't violate assignment restrictions;</p><p>(b) if you learned about those features from an online source or a GenAI suggestion, you must clearly document the source and be ready to explain how those features and why you use them;</p><p>(c) those features won't be covered on an exam, so you're depriving yourself of the opportunity to use the assignment to learn course material;</p><p>(d) you better learn exactly how those features work before using them due to item #1, #3a, and #3b</p><h2>Academic Integrity</h2><p>Please review policies for <i>Academic Integrity</i>, <i>Using Code from Other Sources</i>, and <i>Using Advanced AI Systems</i> under <a href="https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs349/1249/policies/">Course Policies</a>.</p><p>Assignments are your own individual work:</p><ul><li>You <i>must</i> design and implement assignments by yourself. There are no group assignments.</li><li>You <i>may</i> use code examples provided in-class (i.e., in the CS349 public repo). You <i>may</i> directly use or include portions of these in-class samples in your assignments. Some assignments may also, at the instructor’s discretion, provide starter code that you may use. If this is the case, it will be specified in the assignment. <strong>You do not have to cite or attribute code from lectures, code from the course demo code repo, or code provided as assignment starter code.</strong></li><li>You <i>may not</i> use another student's code in your assignments (this includes current or past students of this course), and you <i>may not</i> share your code with anyone else in the course. You <i>may</i> discuss how you accomplished something in general terms with other students, but you <i>may not</i> directly share code.</li><li>You <i>may not</i> use third-party libraries in your assignments other than those explicitly permitted by the assignment description.</li><li>You <i>may not</i> make your code publicly available on any hosting sites (e.g. GitHub), even after the end of the term. If you wish to show your code to potential employers, you must post use a private or restricted repository.</li></ul><h2>Illness</h2><p><strong>If you are ill and unable to meet a course deadline,</strong> then <i>you must email the course ISC (</i><a href="https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs349/1249/#ISC"><i>Caroline Kierstead</i></a><i>)</i>, and follow the guidelines and steps outlined in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations">Math Accommodations page</a>.</p><ul><li>For assignments, the accommodations may be extra time up to the day the assignment solution is released or discussed in class.</li><li>For the midterm exam, the accommodation will be chosen by the instructor: an oral make-up midterm, a written make-up midterm, or shifting weight to the final exam.</li><li>For the final exam, the standard policy is to receive an INC and write the final the next time the course is offered.</li></ul><p>If you are ill and exhibiting COVID symptoms, you should also register using the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-my-illness">online self-declaration form</a>.</p><h2>Self-Declared Short-term Absence</h2><p>In Fall 2022, the University expanded the options for a self-declared absence for undergraduate students by introducing the option of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences">self-declaring a "short-term absence"</a> (which we refer to here as an STA). It's your responsibility to adhere to the conditions and required steps outlined on that page and below.</p><p><strong>If your STA overlaps with an assignment submission or scheduled midterm,</strong> <i>you must notify the course ISC (</i><a href="https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs349/1249/#ISC"><i>Caroline Kierstead</i></a><i>) before your STA begins by submitting a request for accommodation using the web form at </i><a href="https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs349/cgi-bin/extension/absence.cgi">https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs349/cgi-bin/extension/absence.cgi</a> <strong>in addition to submitting your STA declaration</strong>. We need to be aware of your absence in advance to make appropriate accommodations. Failure to notify the ISC before your STA begins may result in a 0 on the missed assignment or midterm.</p><p><i>For assignments,</i> the accommodation will be elimination of the late penalty. For example, if the assignment is due at 6 PM on a Friday and your STA includes that Friday, then you can hand in your assignment 48 hours after the original deadline (Sunday at 6 PM) with no late penalty. There are no extensions beyond the maximum 48-hour late period after the original deadline.</p><p><i>For a midterm exam,</i> the accommodation will be chosen by the instructor: either an oral make-up midterm, a written make-up midterm, or shifting weight to the final exam. Make-up midterms are typically scheduled on the first weekday after the STA ends.</p><h2>Academic Integrity</h2><p>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. Contact the <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/">Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information. You are expected to follow the policies outlined for assignment submissions.</p><p>To ensure academic integrity, MOSS (Measure of Software Similarities) is used in this course as a means of comparing students' assignments. We will report suspicious activity, and penalties for plagiarism/cheating are severe. Please read the available information about academic integrity very carefully.</p><h2>Using Code from Other Sources</h2><p>Students are expected to submit their own work.</p><p>If you use code from other sources (e.g. Stack Overflow, online article, etc.) you must document the source as a comment where the specific code is used. No single source can constitute more than 10% of your assignment.</p><p>You can use any code from this term's offering of CS 349 without documenting it as a source. This includes starter code for assignments, code shown in lectures, and code from the course code repo.</p><h2>Using Advanced AI Systems</h2><p>Use of advanced AI systems to generate code (ie. CoPilot, ChatGPT, etc.) is also considered using code from other sources. The same rules apply from the previous policy: each AI system source must be documented and no single source can constitute more than 10% of your assignment.</p><h2>Student Discipline</h2><p>A student is expected to know <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/">what constitutes academic integrity</a> to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about ‘rules’ for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate Associate Dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p><h2>Intellectual Property</h2><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policies/policy-73-intellectual-property-rights">intellectual property of their instructor</a>, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof)</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides)</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams), and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li><li>All source code written by the instructor and provided in lecture, as starter code for an assignment, or in a sample code repository.</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository). Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><h2>Students with Disabilities</h2><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a> collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with temporary or permanent disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations, please register with the AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term. They will in-turn contact your instructors and arrange accomodations if necessary.</p><h2>Mental Health Resources</h2><p>If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.</p><h3>On-Campus</h3><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">Campus Wellness</a>: primary medical care and mental health services.</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Counselling Services</a>: provides programming and services to help you lead a healthy and balanced life.</li><li><a href="https://wusa.ca/services/uw-mates">MATES</a>: one-to-one undergraduate peer support program offered through WUSA.</li></ul><h3>Off-campus</h3><ul><li><a href="https://good2talk.ca">Good2Talk (24/7)</a>: Free confidential help line for post-secondary students.

We recognize the immense value of the diversity in identities, perspectives, and contributions that students bring, and the benefit it has on our educational environment. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In particular:</p><ul><li>We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternate/preferred name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the semester so we may make appropriate changes to our records.</li><li>We will honour your religious holidays and celebrations. Please inform of us these at the start of the course.</li><li>We will follow AccessAbility Services guidelines and protocols on how to best support students with different learning needs.</li></ul><p> </p>

For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
