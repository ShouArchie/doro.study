<p>CS 115 has been designed with the diverse interests, backgrounds, and goals of students always in mind. As we are aware of the varied ways in which this material might be of use in the future, we have included concepts that are beautiful and universal. </p><p>The focus of the course is foundational concepts in computer science (rather than the mechanics of programming) and ways of thinking about computation (rather than solving tasks in a rote fashion). Students will learn skills that are applicable to new languages and environments, not just those used in the course. </p><p>Because of the fundamental nature of the concepts taught in CS 115, the course can serve both students whose primary interest in computers is in their use in their chosen areas of study and students intending to minor in CS. </p>

<h4>Modules (Concept Checks and Quizzes)</h4><p>By default, programming questions all allow unlimited attempts. Other questions typically allow one or two—one for Wrap-Up Quiz questions, and two everywhere else. There may be some exceptions, so be sure to verify the number of attempts permitted before answering a question.</p><p>All Concept Checks, Warm-Up Quiz questions, Wrap-Up Quiz questions, and Study Problems are equally weighted. However, we will drop 10% of your lowest scoring answers when computing your grade. So don't worry if you make a mistake here and there, or encounter a problem that stumps you. It's possible to earn the full 20% without answering every question correctly. (And some questions are designed to be more challenging than others!)</p><h4>Assignments</h4><p>There will be nine assignments during the term. Assignments will consist mostly of programming questions.</p><p>As with quizzes, we will drop the lowest of your nine assignments, and compute the assignment component of your final grade based on the other eight.</p><p>You will submit assignments using a web-based system called MarkUs, which allows TAs to view and mark the assignment and provide you with feedback. Always read automated email messages from MarkUs. These may warn you of problems with your assignment submission that will result in you losing most or all of your marks. Always read the feedback from TAs. They may tell you about errors that could cause you to lose marks in later assignments.</p><h4>Exams</h4><p>There will be a final exam at the end of the term, after the end of lectures. It will be written in person, with paper and pencil, either at the University of Waterloo or at a remote testing centre.</p><h4>Passing the Course</h4><p>Although the final exam is worth only 40% of your final grade, <i>you must receive at least 50% on the exam in order to pass the course</i>. If you do not pass the final exam, you will receive a failing grade.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  We use a system called MOSS (Measure of Software Similarity) to check if multiple students have submitted the same assignment solutions. If you do not know a lot about Computer Science (a reasonable assumption if you're enrolled in CS 115), it may be difficult to appreciate how sophisticated MOSS is, and how absurdly easy it is for us to detect cheating. Consider how good Google is at finding relevant information based on a query that's incomplete or poorly formed. MOSS has to do something similar, but on a much smaller scale (a few thousand assignment files, not the whole internet) and with much simpler data (program code, not human language). It can't be tricked, so don't try.<br/><br/>Violations of academic integrity, whether on assignments or in any other assessment in this course, can carry serious penalties. Be sure you are aware of the rules surrounding academic integrity, and talk to a member of the course staff if you have any concerns.

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>This course requires you to complete a set of assignments. Each assignment will consist primarily of programming questions, though a few other questions may be included here and there (e.g., tracing questions). You will complete programming questions directly in DrRacket, and not on this website. You should create a "CS 115" folder on your computer to organize your assignment solutions.</p><p>When we test your assignment functions for correctness, we will run your code only with legal inputs. That is, we will apply your functions to arguments that match the expectations laid out in the question in terms of number of arguments, types, numeric ranges, and so on. Unless the question specifically says otherwise, you don't have to worry about "bad data".</p><p>Unlike the programming problems on the website, which are checked for correctness only, code submitted in assignments will be graded by hand for good style. A submission that is badly written or formatted may lose marks, even if it runs correctly. In the assignments, you will be directed to the relevant parts of our Style Guide to ensure that you have met our minimum requirements for good style.</p><h4>MarkUs</h4><p>You will submit assignments to a web-based system called MarkUs. Teaching assistants will grade the assignments there and provide you with feedback. Full instructions for using MarkUs can be found on the <a href="https://online.cs.uwaterloo.ca/courses/course-v1:UW+CS115+2023_05/jump_to_id/c78f4b2b1e174533aef4d049bf00feae">next page</a>.</p><h4>Submit early, submit often</h4><p>A given assignment may contain multiple questions, each of which requires you to submit a separate file to MarkUs. You can submit each of those files as many times as you like before the deadline. Every time you submit a file, we'll run some basic checks on it to make sure it looks valid, and send you preliminary feedback via email. After the deadline, we'll perform more thorough marking of the last file(s) you submitted before the deadline.</p><h4>Assignment deadlines</h4><p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you submit your assignment correctly to MarkUs before the deadline. The deadline is based on the time of day in Waterloo, Ontario (Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Time, depending on the time of year). The current date and time in Waterloo are always shown at the top-right of course web pages.</p><p><strong>Late assignment submissions will never be accepted under any circumstances.</strong> We will not grant an extension because you attempted to submit at the last minute, or because your internet connection failed at the crucial moment of submission. We will not accept an assignment sent via email because you could not access MarkUs. We will not accept a revision after the deadline that fixes a typo that prevented your assignment from working.</p><p>Start early, submit early, and submit often. Always check the automated testing email generated by MarkUs, which can catch simple mistakes that might cost you a lot of marks. Give yourself (more than) enough time to submit <i>and</i> receive and read MarkUs's response.</p><h4>Missed assignments</h4><p>If you are unable to complete an assignment because of illness, please contact Barbara Daly, the Instructional Support Coordinator, to provide a verification of your illness. At the discretion of the course staff, you will be excused from completing the missed assignment and your other assignments will be re-weighted to compensate. If you miss too many assignments, you may be asked to withdraw from the course.</p><p><strong>Self Declared /VIF/Covid Related Absence</strong></p><p>If you are absent and submit  through Quest,<strong> there is no need to email course staff.</strong> We receive notification and make note in our master database of your absence. You will be excused from the missed assignment and the weight will be shifted. </p><h4>Re-marking</h4><p>If you feel that there was an error or oversight in the marking of your assignment, please fill out the Remark Request form for the particular assignment on Learn. The forms will be in a Survey on Learn for each assignment for two weeks. The remark will be done following the two week period. After submitting a remark request ISAs will review and remark your entire assignment; if there are any major concerns then these will be communicated to the instructors if needed. Note that your assignment grade may increase or decrease after a remark.</p>
