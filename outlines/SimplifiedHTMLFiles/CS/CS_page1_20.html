<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  MOSS (Measure of Software Similarities)<br/><br/>MOSS is used in this course as a means of comparing students' assignments to ensure academic integrity. We will report suspicious activity, and penalties for plagiarism/cheating are severe. Please read the available information about academic integrity very carefully.<br/><br/>Note: Submissions for programming questions should only use code and concepts taught during lectures. Use of code or advanced concepts not taught in the course will be viewed as a possible violation of Academic Integrity for passing off someone else's work as your own. Code identified as generated from AI will also be viewed as a possible vioaltion of Academic Integrity (see below).

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Due Date Policy</h3><ul><li>Assignments and quizzes are due on the due-date at the time specified above in the Evaluation section. Note that if the deadline gives a time such as 11:59pm, that means 11:59pm and ZERO seconds.</li><li>No late quizzes will be accepted.</li><li>The assignments have a flexible late-day system detailed here:<ul><li>Each student begins the term with three (3) 24-hour assignment extensions (called Grace Periods on MarkUs) to use as they wish. These cannot be used on quizzes.</li><li>You can only use a maximum of two assignment extensions on any single assignment.</li><li>There is no way to get any more assignment extensions.</li><li>Assignment extensions can be used all together on one assignment, or split across different assignments.</li><li>You do not need a reason to use assignment extensions, you may use them as you please.</li><li>If you are using assignment extensions, you must use a whole number of them on an assignment.<br/>(Example: you cannot use 1.5 assignment extensions, you must use 2 extensions if you are 30-hours late).</li><li>If an assignment is not handed in by the due date (plus any used assignment extensions), it will be assigned a grade of zero and will not be marked.</li><li>No extension may be used on the last assignment.</li><li>This policy replaces the university policy on Short-Term Absences. Students will not be granted extensions for an assignment by taking a short-term absence on Quest unless they use their assignment extensions.</li></ul></li><li>Be aware that assignments are submitted via MarkUs. This system is maintained on the CS teaching servers. These servers are shared with all other CS courses. As a result, server loads may cause MarkUs to take an extended period of time to accept your assignment. Student are advised to submit to MarkUs early and often to ensure their work is accepted before any deadline.</li><li>For all other circumstances, formal documentation is required. Note that a circumstance covering a day or two is not sufficient reason for missing an assessment. Students are expected to start assignments early in case something unexpected occurs closer to the deadline. If sufficient documentation is supplied to the Instructional Support Coordinator and assignment extensions are exhausted then the weight of that assessment is moved to the other course components (to be determined by the course staff). See the CS 230 <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs230/w25/accommodations.shtml">Accommodations</a> page for acceptable forms of documentation and for procedures to get accommodations.</li></ul><h3>Assignment/Quiz Return</h3><p>Assignments are returned through <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs230/w25/markus.shtml">MarkUs</a>.</p><p>Quizzes are returned on <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/lms/quizzing/admin/quizzes_manage.d2l?ou=1098198">LEARN</a>.</p><h3>Remarking Policy</h3><p>Requests for remarking an assignment may be submitted to the IA (cs230@uwaterloo.ca) at up to one week after the assignment is returned in MarkUs, except for possibly the last assignment where a shorter time period may be given.</p><p>No remark requests will be accepted for quizzes.</p><h3>Rules for Group Work</h3><p>Unless otherwise stated in the assignment, assignments are to be done individually.</p><p>Quizzes are to be done individually.</p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.

We recognize the immense value of the diversity in identities, perspectives, and contributions that students bring, and the benefit it has on our educational environment. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In particular:</p><ul><li>We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternate/preferred name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the semester so we may make appropriate changes to our records.</li><li>We will honour your religious holidays and celebrations. Please inform of us these at the start of the course.</li><li>We will follow AccessAbility Services guidelines and protocols on how to best support students with different learning needs.</li></ul><h2>Intellectual Property</h2><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student's educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner's permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
