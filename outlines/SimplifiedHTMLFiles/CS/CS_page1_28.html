<p>The grading scheme will depend on how much and what parts of the course are offered online vs offered on campus. The basic weights used for various components (assuming on campus offerings) are:</p><ul><li>AW=20 for Assignments (7 assignments, A1=2, A2=3, A3=3, A4=3, A5=3, A6=3, A7=3)</li><li>PW=5 for Participation Marks (half for clicker questions during lecture and half for tutorial problems during labs)</li><li>MW=25 for Midterm</li><li>FW=50 for Final Exam</li></ul><p>Participation Marks are a combination of clicker questions asked during lectures and tutorial problems that are to be submitted after labs. Potentially up to 20% of your lowest clicker question marks and 20% of your lowest tutorial problems may be dropped (see the Switch to Online Guidelines below).</p><p>Note: Students may only enrol for answering clicker questions in their own registered section. Students registering their clicker for other sections will receive a grade of zero on clicker questions.</p><p>If the course has to switch online (due to public health guidelines), clicker question marks may be replaced with online quizzes.</p><p>If the Final Exam is offered online, its weight will change to</p><ul><li>FW=40 for Online Final Exam</li></ul><p>See the <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs251/W25/examinfo.shtml">Exam Information</a> page for information about the Midterm and Final Exam.</p><p>Students are required to obtain a passing grade for the weighted average of the Midterm and Final Exam (see formula below).</p><p>We will apply the following algorithm to determine your final course grade (assuming the entire course is held on-campus):</p><ul><li><code>Participation = 1/2*(Best 80% of Tutorial Questions) + 1/2*(Best 80% of Clicker Questions)</code></li><li><code>Normal Â = (AW*Assignments + PW*Participation + MW*Midterm + FW*Final) / (AW+PW+MW+FW)</code></li><li><code>Exam Â  Â = (MW*Midterm + FW*Final) / (MW+FW)</code></li><li><code>if ( Exam &lt; 50% )</code><ul><li><code>Course Grade = min (Normal, Exam)</code></li></ul></li><li><code>else</code><ul><li><code>Course Grade = Normal</code></li></ul></li></ul><p>Â </p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Attendance:</h3><p><strong>You are highly encouraged to attend all lectures and keep detailed class notes.</strong></p><h3>Posting Course Information and Materials</h3><p>The course notes are posted in the protected section of the course website. Students are required to delete all course files at the end of the term.</p><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a studentâs educational experience. Sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property ownerâs permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.</p><p>In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>The Secretariat has posted <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external">Guidelines</a> concerning Chegg, OneClass and other similar businesses.</p><p>Should the course be required to switch online (possibly due to public health guidelines), videos may be posted. They are considered part of the course materials. All requirements on intellectual property mentioned above apply to them as well.<br/>Online lectures may be recorded. Students attending online lectures implicitly acknowledge and consent to being recording during such lectures.</p><h3>Assignment submission</h3><p>Assignments must be submitted online on edX and/or Crowdmark.</p><h3>Assignment returns</h3><p>Graded material will be returned to students via edX and/or Crowdmark.</p><h3>Late Assignments</h3><p>In general, assignments submitted late and without an approved extension by the course ISC will not be accepted and will be given a grade of zero.</p><p>If you have an approved extension for your assignment, submit your assignment before the extension deadline.</p><h3>Missed Assignments</h3><p>An assignment not handed in receives a mark of 0, unless there is a documented reason. If a student makes a short-term 48-hour declaration, they may contact the course ISC to obtain a 48-hour extension. If another documented reason is supplied, an extension may be provided or the weight of the missing assignment may be shifted to the (weighted) exam component of the grade at the discretion of the course ISC. Please check the <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs251/W25/accommodations.shtml">accommodations</a> page for further information. A copy of the documented reason must be given to and approved by the course ISC.</p><p>Since assignments are posted in advance with deadlines stated in advance, no adjustments will be made for assignments missed because of co-op interviews.</p><p>Please note that no more than two assignments may be excluded from the final grade, regardless of your circumstances. If your circumstances are such that that level of accommodation is insufficient, consult an academic advisor to discuss your options.</p><h3>Missed Exams</h3><p>A missed Exam will receive a mark of 0, unless there is a valid documented reason. If a documented reason is provided for missing an exam, its weight will be shifted to the other exams or the student may have to take an incomplete in the course (determined by the course staff). Please check the <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs251/W25/accommodations.shtml">accommodations</a> page for further information.</p><h3>Incompletes</h3><p>If a student is in good standing in the course and a documented reason is provided for missing the Final Exam, a grade of incomplete (INC) may be given (to be determined by the course staff at their discretion).<br/><br/>The course ISC must be contacted immediately to verify the student's standing in the course and verify that the reason for missing the Final Exam is sufficient and valid.<br/><br/>If an INC is granted, the student's grade will be calculated using the weightings of the course components from the term the student was registered, the student's term marks from the registered term, and the marks from the assessments that are written in future terms to replace any missed assessments. The Final Exam is usually written with the scheduled exam in the following term.</p><h3>Questions or Concerns about the Way Your Work Has Been Marked</h3><p>You have up to one week after the assessment has been returned to request a remark.</p><p>For assignments, contact the course ISA. If you are not satisfied with the response, then you can take it to the instructor.</p><p>Note that we may remark the entire assignment, quiz, or exam, so you could receive a grade lower than the one originally assigned.</p><h3>Cheating</h3><p>We will usually use the standard university penalty for cheating on an assignment/quiz, which is 0 on the assignment/quiz question and a deduction of 5% from the course grade. (The final penalty is usually determined by the Academic Integrity Officer of the Faculty of Mathematics.) In addition, a letter will be sent to the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies informing them of the matter. Note that penalties are significantly higher for exams and for repeat offenders.</p><h3>Rules for Group Work</h3><p>Discussion of assignments is allowed, but each student must hand in their own copy of the assignment and word-for-word copying is not allowed. You should not search for assignment solutions online, copy solutions from previous terms, photocopy another student's assignment, or copy another student's answers word-for-word.</p><p>You should <strong>not</strong> discuss quiz questions or test questions with other students in the course until after the day the quiz/test is due. Solutions for quizzes or tests that are too similar will be considered cases of excessive collaboration.</p><h3>In-Class Discipline</h3><p>Students are encouraged to attend all lectures, but are required not to be disruptive during lectures out of respect for their classmates and for the instructor. Disruptive behaviour includes talking with people next to them, texting on a phone, playing YouTube videos, Facebook and Twitter updates, etc.</p><p>Please ensure that all phones are silenced during lectures, to avoid distracting other members of the class. Also note that comments and feedback about the course are welcome, but outside of lecture time.</p><p>A student who is found to be disruptive during lectures will be given only one verbal warning for the term. At the instructor's discretion, if the same student continues to be disruptive, for each incident of disruption, they will be penalized 3% of their final mark for the course, and may be asked to leave the lecture during which the disruption incident occurred. They would also be liable for any missed milestones during the lecture.</p><h3>Group Discussion (Piazza)</h3><p>General questions on <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs251/W25/piazza.shtml">Piazza</a> should be posted publicly, so all students can read the answers.</p><p>If you need to contact the course staff about a situation specific to you (e.g., an assignment grade), please consider contacting the instructor or ISA responsible for the assignment by email, or talking to them during their office hours.</p><h3>Switch to Online Guidelines</h3><p>It is possible that circumstances may disrupt on campus teaching during the term. The following policies will be followed in this course.</p><ul><li>Students should attend the section they're enrolled in and <i>only</i> the section they're enrolled in</li><li><i>Shift to Online</i><br/>Weeks in which the course is offered online, readings from the course textbook and videos will be used in place of lectures during this time. Further, a weekly quiz will be given and used in place of clickers in the marking scheme. Both the videos and the weekly quiz will be in Learn.</li><li><i>Dropping lowest clickers marks, lowest quiz score</i><br/>If five or more quizzes are given, then your lowest quiz mark will be dropped before computing your quiz mark. If 15 or more clicker questions are asked, the lowest 20% of your clicker marks will be dropped before computing your clicker mark.</li><li><i>Online Exams</i><br/>If in-person exams are not possible, the midterm and/or final exam may be administered as a combination Learn/edX/Crowdmark exam.</li><li><i>Illness/Quarantine</i><br/>The intention of dropping the lowest 20% of clicker question marks is to account for students who cannot attend classes due to personal circumstances (eg. co-op interviews, illnesses including COVID, etc.). If a student is forced to miss class for an extended period of time (at least two weeks), you can contact the course ISC for an appropriate accommodation.<br/>A missed midterm will have its weight shifted in the final exam. A missed final exam will generally result in an incomplete in the course (subject to university policy that you must be in good standing in the course).<br/>If the entire course is moved online during all or part of a quarantine period, then no accomodations will be made during this time.<br/>Should you contract COVID, an accommodation may be provided to you.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the departmentâs administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about ârulesâ for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (TurnitinÂ®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. TurnitinÂ® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
