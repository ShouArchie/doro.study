<div>
<div>CS 492:</div>
<p>This course is designed to consider the problems encountered by individuals, organizations and society as computer technology is adopted, with a view towards assessing possible courses of action.</p>

<div>
<p>CS 492, as a whole, considers the impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society. Students learn how to make informed judgements about the social and ethical consequences of deploying computer technologies and how to foster critical thought and professional responsibility.</p><p>Section 003 of CS 492, in particular, will explore in depth the many ways in which modern computing systems—including the data they ingest, the decisions made by the people who develop them, and their myriad and nearly ubiquitous applications—may enable, encourage, or prevent societal discrimination or privacy violations of various types. Students will examine how algorithms and artificial intelligence (“AI”) systems may provide differential treatment and/or outcomes for different populations, and how they may invade privacy and cause other harms to individuals and society. Students will also consider the potential technical, legal/regulatory, and social/policy interventions that could ameliorate the harms caused by such algorithms and systems, and will weigh the advantages and disadvantaged of each. </p><p>By the end of the seminar, students should be able to (i) discuss with colleagues and others the positive and negative discriminatory and privacy consequences of various current AI applications and other technological innovations, and (ii) suggest different approaches to address systemic bias or privacy violations—including technical solutions and legal/regulatory or social/policy changes—and explain why certain of these approaches might or might not work in specific circumstances.</p>

<h2>
  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>Three sections of CS 492 are being offered in Winter 2025. Two of them (Sections 001 and 002) are taught by Professor Richard Treffler and meet twice a week. The third (Section 003) is taught by Professor Maura R. Grossman and <strong>meets only once per week on Tuesday mornings, from 8:30 AM – 11:20 AM, in AL 124</strong>. Because the structure and content of Professor Treffler’s and Professor Grossman’s sections are completely different, <strong>you must remain in your assigned section, which is Section 003, with Professor Grossman</strong>. You are free to bring food and drink to class, but there will also be at least one 10-minute break during each class. The third hour of each class will consist of a “lab” where you may meet with your course instructor or TAs for assistance with your research and writing assignments, or gather with your small-group for project planning and preparation.</p><p>Class sessions will contain limited lecture material and will consist primarily of facilitated class discussions. Students will be expected to attend all class sessions, to complete all readings and video assignments (including the “From-the-News” item(s)) in advance of class, and to participate actively in the discussions.</p><p><strong>To be 100% clear, attendance at all class sessions is required unless an absence is excused, in advance, by the instructor</strong>. An excessive number of absences will impact the participation component of a student’s grade. That said, please do not attend class if you are sick and should be in self-isolation; just let your instructor and TAs know you are ill and unable to attend class. Class sessions will not be recorded.</p><p><strong>There will be a Slack channel for this seminar</strong>. Announcements, responses to student inquiries, copyrighted reading materials, and other important information will be shared there, so students should be sure to regularly monitor the course Slack channel. A link to join the Slack channel may be found here: <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/cs492section003w25/shared_invite/zt-2wl26b5p3-pxMv5Z6mRjbOoNybeKXSwA">https://join.slack.com/t/cs492section003w25/shared_invite/zt-2wl26b5p3-pxMv5Z6mRjbOoNybeKXSwA</a>.</p><p><strong>Most weeks, we will begin class with a “From-the-News” segment</strong> featuring one or more relevant articles, videos, or podcasts from recent media. I will supply you with the article(s), video(s), or podcast(s)—which will be relatively short—no later than the Friday before the class session. You will find it/them on the “From-the-News” channel on the course Slack. Please submit candidate articles, videos, or podcasts for me to consider for this segment; you can post them in the From-the-News channel on the course Slack by Wednesday evening the week before the session you want us to discuss the item, so I have adequate time to review it. Tell me why you think it would be a good choice for discussion. Submitting articles, videos, or podcasts in this way will count towards the participation component of a student’s grade. If I select your From-the-News submission for class discussion, I will award you a small bonus mark towards your final class participation grade in the course.</p><p> </p><p>Please refer to the Course Syllabus provided by the instructor on the LEARN and Slack sites for this course for a detailed breakdown of the weekly class schedule with assignments and course materials.</p>

<div>
<p>This course has neither a midterm nor a final exam. Evaluation in this course will be comprised of the following three components:</p><h3><strong>a. Weekly Commentaries or Position Papers: 30%</strong></h3><ul><li>There will be weekly writing assignments, which will consist of either commentaries on the readings or position papers (<i>i.e.</i>, thought pieces). There will be around eleven (11) such papers assigned; <strong>only the top six (6) will count towards a student’s grade</strong>. Students may submit as many of the assignments as they wish. Students will receive regular, written feedback on their papers from one of the three TAs. The prompt for the weekly commentary or position paper will be provided at the end of class each week and will also be posted on the course Slack channel. <strong>Unless otherwise specified, the weekly paper will be due the following Monday night at 11:59 PM to the Dropbox for this course on LEARN</strong>. Please submit the paper in either .docx or .pdf format.</li><li>The six (6) best commentaries or position papers submitted by a student will each count for 5% of the student’s final grade. Therefore, the written component of the course will account for a total of 30% of a student’s final grade. Papers will be graded on a scale of zero to five. Should a student wish, they may submit any commentary or position paper to the instructor by email in an editable format (<i>i.e.</i>, docx) for additional feedback beyond that received from the TA, particularly with respect to improving their writing style.</li><li><strong>The weekly commentaries or position papers should be approximately two pages in length (</strong><i><strong>i.e.</strong></i><strong>, 1000 words)</strong>. We will provide some examples of strong papers from previous offerings of this course and similar courses on Slack, as well as the rubric the TAs will use for grading the papers, which offers some suggestions on what constitutes a strong paper for this course.</li><li>The University of Waterloo’s Writing and Communications Centre (“WCC”) works across all faculties to help students clarify their ideas, develop their voices, and write in the style(s) appropriate to their discipline(s). Centre staff offer one-on-one support in planning assignments and presentations, using and documenting research, organizing and structuring papers, and revising for clarity and coherence. We particularly encourage using the WCC for students whose English or writing skills are not at the level where they wish them to be. Staff from the WCC will also offer a “lab” on how to create a thesis statement and develop arguments around it as one of the third- hour sessions of CS 492 Section 003.</li><li><strong>A note on the use of large language models (“LLMs”) and generative AI systems</strong>: While it is <strong>my strong preference that students not use these systems and prepare their journal entries entirely on their own</strong>, students are permitted to use such systems to improve the technical quality of their writing, but they may not use them to do their writing for them. For example, you may not ask an LLM to generate your weekly commentary or position paper, but you may draft your commentary or position paper and ask an LLM to assist you in improving it (<i>i.e.</i>, correcting your spelling or grammar, idiom, punctuation, or sentence mechanics, clarity, or brevity, but nothing beyond this). You may certainly use generative AI to include images or artwork with your commentary or position paper. <strong>If you do use one of these systems, you must inform us that you have done so and how you used it</strong>. A good rule of thumb is the following. If you cannot fully explain your entry and how you came up with the ideas expressed in it, you have likely misused the LLM or generative AI system and you should redo your paper. In other words, the ideas should be your own; you may obtain assistance in expressing your ideas better, particularly if communicating in written English is challenging for you. You may certainly supplement your ideas using AI-generated imagery; just say so.</li></ul><h3><strong>b. Class Participation: 30%</strong></h3><ul><li>Students’ class participation will be assessed based on overall thoughtfulness and quality, rather than overall quantity. What I am looking for is for students to demonstrate meaningful engagement with the material, each other, and me, and for students to be able justify their arguments and respond respectfully to contrary positions presented by others. During the course of the term, students are likely to be asked to advance or defend positions that may differ from their own personal views.</li><li>As mentioned above, suggesting articles, videos, or podcasts for the “From-the-News” component of the class will count towards a student’s class participation grade, as will contributing meaningfully to any discussions in the course Slack channel.</li><li>Students for whom communicating orally or in English is a challenge or who are introverted may need to work especially hard for this component of the course. Please let me know how I can help you participate if English is not your first language or you are introverted (for example, should I call on you?).</li></ul><h3><strong>c. Small-Group Project: 40%</strong></h3><ul><li>There will be a small-group project due at the end of the term that will be completed by a team comprised of between two and four students. Each team will submit a joint work product that, depending on the group’s preference, will consist of some kind of creative project, such as the development of an online program or application, website, chatbot, game, video presentation, conducting a series of interviews or questionnaires, or conducting other research related to a topic covered in the course.</li><li>I urge you not to do a podcast for this small-group project unless you have something novel to say or a particularly unique style for presenting the material; it is too easy to just make a chatty conversation with not much content, which will not garner a good grade on the project. If you insist on doing a podcast, please focus on a small number of topics, do research to find articles, videos, or other materials to discuss that are not on the course syllabus, keep a tight thematic focus, and find a very creative way to present the topic.</li><li>Unlike the weekly commentaries or position papers, students are encouraged to experiment with LLMs and generative AI systems and to incorporate them as part of their small-group projects!</li><li>The small-group project should involve a technical, legal/regulatory, ethical, or social/policy issue of the sort addressed in the course, involving a computing topic that connects to discrimination, surveillance, and/or privacy. Teams will identify their topic, confirm the appropriateness of the topic with the instructor and TAs, divide the labour among their team members, and accommodate different perspectives, viewpoints, and expertise of the team members.</li><li>If students encounter any challenges in the small-group project work, they should contact the instructor and/or TAs promptly; in particular, please do not wait until the week before the project is due to indicate that group members have been unresponsive to their assignments. At that point there is nothing we can do to address the problem.</li><li>Teams may, but are not required, to prepare a short presentation to give at the final class session of the term. For students who choose to present, this will contribute to their class participation grade.</li><li>The small-group project will have two interim milestones due during the course of the term:<ul><li><strong>Milestone #1</strong>: <strong>By email to the instructor and TAs by 11:59 PM on Friday, February 14, 2025</strong>, each team will submit a one-page project proposal in editable format (<i>i.e.</i>, .docx) identifying the group membership, providing the topic under consideration, and the form the project will take, with as much detail and specificity as possible. Tell us why the topic is interesting, how or why it is relevant to the seminar, and how you will explore the topic in your project. We will review and respond in writing to the proposal largely for the purpose of confirming the suitability of the topic and the form of the project, and to advise you whether what is described is consistent with the goals and objectives of the small-group project.</li><li><strong>Milestone #2</strong>: <strong>By email to the instructor and TAs by 11:59 PM on Friday, March 14, 2025</strong>, each team will submit a two- to-three page progress report in editable format (<i>i.e.</i>, .docx) describing the goal(s) of the project, what question(s) the team is seeking to answer, why the form of the project is appropriate to answer those questions, what research the team has undertaken thus far, and what the team has learned thus far. If any problems or challenges have arisen, they should be raised in the progress report. A key component of Milestone #2 is to describe the current research the group has done, and what challenges have been encountered (if any) in finding good resources or content for the project. We will again provide written feedback on the scope and level of seriousness of the research and identify any gaps or deficiencies in the project proposal, including around the research itself or its suitability for the small-group project.</li></ul></li><li>The two Milestone submissions above will be considered as part of the overall grade for the small-group project.</li><li>The submission of the small-group project itself will consist of three or four components:<ol><li>A one-page description of the project, including the group members’ names, what question or topic was being addressed, what form the project took, and a summary of the findings. This may also include a link to any particular items you want to have considered in your grade on the project (e.g., a bibliography of your research, your source code, etc.).</li><li>A copy of the PowerPoint or other slide deck used by the team for its presentation at the final class session of the term (if any);</li><li>A five-minute video tour of the project and its findings. This should focus on results and demonstrate any tool or application, website, game, or chatbot you have built. For a video or podcast project, identify the research you did, the articles you discussed, how you found them, and the technology you used to prepare the video or podcast.</li><li>The actual project: a usable tool, application, or website, a finished video, a functional chatbot, a playable game, or whatever form the final project takes.</li></ol></li><li><strong>All of the above should be submitted to the course’s LEARN Dropbox by 11:59 PM on Friday, April 4, 2025. No extensions will be granted</strong>.</li></ul><h4><strong>Rules for Small-Group and Written Work</strong></h4><p>The small-group project should consist of work performed by the group members: in particular, nothing you submit for marking should be work performed by anyone else. You may, of course, cite to other people’s work that has been inspirational, that you have relied on for ideas, or that your project seeks to critique. That said, the main intellectual contribution of your small-group project must be your own.</p><p>For the weekly commentaries or position papers, they must consist entirely of your own writing; you may discuss your thoughts and ideas with your classmates through the class sessions and in your own conversations outside of class, whether on Slack or otherwise. You may use LLMs or generative AI only as described above. A good rule of thumb is that if I were to pull you aside and ask you to explain the ideas or arguments underlying your writing, you should be able to explain to me what you meant by every sentence; if not, it suggests that it is likely not sufficiently your own ideation.</p><h4><strong>Marks, Discussions and Appeals</strong></h4><p>Should any student wish to discuss the written feedback or mark received on an individual weekly commentary or position paper, that student should first reach out to the TA who provided the feedback or mark by email to schedule a time to discuss the feedback or mark. Should the student continue to be dissatisfied with the feedback or mark, they may reach out to the instructor by email to schedule a time to discuss their concerns. This should be rare since overall grades can easily be improved by submitting an additional written assignment. Formal appeals may result in assignment of the same grade, a higher grade or a lower grade than the previous grade awarded by the TA. Should any student wish to discuss the written feedback on either of their small-group project Milestones, their mark on any component of the course, or their grade in the course as a whole, they should email the instructor to schedule an appointment.</p><p> </p>

In many cases, the instructor may be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without express permission is considered a violation of the IP owner’s IP rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of IP belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The owner of the IP rights deserves to know (and may already have given their consent).</p><h2>Land Acknowledgment</h2><p>The University of Waterloo is located on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg, Neutral, and Haudenosaunee people. The main campus is located on the Haldimand Tract, which was granted to the Six Nations, which includes six miles of land on either side of the Grand River. Both I and your TAs are non-Indigenous settlers who have come to this country or to this University to teach and do research, and we are all committed to incorporating Indigenous content and ways of thinking into the work we do. In particular, in this Ethics Workshop, we will discuss bias and discrimination in data and algorithms, and how new technologies and applications can contribute to and ameliorate these problems.</p><p>At the University of Waterloo, active work towards reconciliation takes a number of forms and is centralized within the Office of Indigenous Relations.</p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
