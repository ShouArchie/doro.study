<h3>Assignments</h3><p>All assignments must be done individually, unless the assignment is explicitly designated as a group assignment. All members of a group receive the same grade (no exceptions). The instructors/staff do not arbitrate group disputes; group members must handle any and all problems. A group assignment may be done individually, but it must be understood that the amount of work is significantly greater and no extra marks are given for this additional work.</p><p>Students may work in pairs while developing test cases for assignments. Each member of the pair must submit a "partner.txt" file that contains the partner's UW userid (not student number) for every submission they worked on together. Different partners may be used for different questions/assignments.</p><p>There will be five regular assignments, the fifth one being a group project, in addition to a preliminary assignment (A0).<br/>A0 is due on Monday, January 20 and it is not graded, but you must complete it before you start working on the other assignments. It is designed to get you familiar with the most basic aspects of working with Linux, and with assignment submission. You must complete A0 in order to receive marks for the rest of the course.</p><p>Assignments 1-5 have two due dates. In the first due date, you will submit the first part of the assignment, which is usually focused on preparing the tests for the second part. In the second due date, you will submit all the remaining tasks of the assignment, which are usually focused on coding.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Most assignments are expected to be due on Monday before 5:00pm. However, the listed due dates are <strong>tentative</strong>, and are subject to change.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Assignment</th><th>Tentative Topics</th><th>Tentative Due Date 1</th><th>Tentative Due Date 2</th><th>Final Grade Weight</th></tr><tr><th>A0</th><th>Preliminary Topics</th><th>Monday, January 20</th><th>N/A</th><th>0</th></tr><tr><th>A1</th><th>Basic C++</th><th>Monday, January 20</th><th>Monday, January 27</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><th>A2</th><th>Introduction to OOP</th><th>Monday, February 3</th><th>Monday, February 10</th><th>6</th></tr><tr><th>A3</th><th>Copy/Move</th><th>Monday, February 24</th><th>Monday, March 3</th><th>6</th></tr><tr><th>A4</th><th>Design Patterns</th><th>Monday, March 10</th><th>Monday, March 17</th><th>8</th></tr><tr><th>A5</th><th>Project</th><th>Monday, March 24</th><th>Monday, March 31</th><th>15</th></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Note: Marmoset is not a compiler!</strong> Do not submit C++ code to Marmoset, without first attempting to compile it yourself.</p><h3>Assignment 5 (Project)</h3><p>Assignment 5 is designed to be a group project that is to be completed in groups of 3 students. You may do the project in pairs or individually, but you will be expected to produce the same level of work as a group of three. Students from different sections can be in the same group. Working on a group is an important learning experience for software development in a team. Moreover, you have the opportunity to discuss your design and implementation ideas with your teammates. In our experience over the years, this greatly contributes to the quality of your final design. Therefore, we strongly recommend working on the project as a group.</p><p>Students in a group will be responsible for forming and managing the group. Course staff will not be able to help you find a group. However, you are free to use Piazza to post communications to help you find a group.</p><p>Course staff will not help you with managing your team, including solving any conflicts that arise. Please be very careful in selecting your group as there are always groups that end up having major issues every term. Note that generally all group members in a project group will get the same grade.</p><p>The project will include running an in-person demo with course staff for grading. Tentative dates for the demos are from April 2-4.</p><p>Note that extensions cannot be granted for Assignment 5 due to preparation for the demos. If ALL group members are ill and properly registered (either using the 48-hour absence on Quest and/or by a Verification of Illness Form), the group may be granted an incomplete (INC) and have to complete a different project in a subsequent term to clear the INC. If not all group members are properly registered, then Assignment 5 must be handed in by the scheduled deadline and the demo must be held by the remaining group members.</p><h3>Exams</h3><p>In-Person examinations will be held only if students are allowed to have exams on campus. There will be two scheduled in-person examinations for this course. Should holding an in-person examination not be possible, an online version will be held in its place.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Examination</th><th>Date</th><th>Final Grade Weight</th></tr><tr><th>Midterm</th><th>Tuesday, March 4, 4:30-6:20pm</th><th>20</th></tr><tr><th>Final</th><th>To Be Announced (by Registrar's Office)</th><th>40</th></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3>Tutorials</h3><p>Most tutorials will have a set of problem(s) to complete. Each weekly set of problems completed succesfully can be used to replace 0.5% of the final grade from the final exam.</p><h3>Grading Scheme</h3><p>Students are expected to write an in-person examination regardless of circumstances should in-person examinations be held. The grading scheme used will depend on which examinations are allowed to be held in-person.</p><p>In the case where both a midterm and final exam can be held, the final course grade will be calculated from the following components and weights:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Component</th><th>Final Grade Weight</th></tr><tr><th>Assignments (A1-A5)</th><th>40</th></tr><tr><th>Midterm</th><th>20</th></tr><tr><th>Final</th><th>40</th></tr><tr><th>Total</th><th>100</th></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Note:</strong> The weight of the final exam will be increased by 1/3 of the value of the marks lost on the midterm. This provides a "second chance" to earn up to one third of those lost marks back, with good final exam performance. This and the weekly tutorial problems are the only adjustment to grades that will be made in the middle of the term. All other grade adjustments (if any) will be applied at the discretion of the instructors, at the end of the term.</p><p>If the midterm exam cannot be held in person, the midterm will have a weight of 5. Thus, the final weighted score will be out of a final weight total reduced by 15.<br/>If the final exam cannot be held in person, the final exam will have a weight of 15. Thus, the final weighted score will be out of a final weight total reduced by 25.<br/>Regardless of case, the final weighted score will be converted to a final course grade out of 100 based on the appropriate final weight total.</p><p>To pass the course, you must satisfy these three conditions:</p><ul><li>A grade of at least 45% on the weighted average of assignments A1-A4</li><li>The following weighted average of the midterm and final exam is at least 50%: (20*Midterm% + 40*FinalExam%)/60. (Note: This weighted average does NOT include the weight shift of 1/3 of the value of marks lost on the midterm and does NOT include marks earned from tutorials.)</li><li>A final course grade of at least 50%</li></ul><p>We will apply the following algorithm to determine your final course grade:</p><ul><li><code>Assignments1to4  = (A1*5 + A2*6 + A3*6 + A4*8) / 25</code></li><li><code>Exams = (Midterm*20 + Final*40) / 60</code></li><li><code>OnlineMid = (Midterm*5 + Final*40) / 45</code></li><li><code>OnlineFinal = (Midterm*20 + Final*15) / 35</code></li><li><code>OnlineExams = (Midterm*5 + Final*15) / 20</code></li><li><code>Normal = A1*5 + A2*6 + A3*6 + A4*8 + A5*15 + Midterm*20 + Final*(40-0.5*TutorialsCompleted) + 0.5*TutorialsCompleted</code></li><li><code>MidtermOnline = A1*5 + A2*6 + A3*6 + A4*8 + A5*15 + Midterm*5 + Final*(40-0.5*TutorialsCompleted) + 0.5*TutorialsCompleted</code></li><li><code>FinalOnline = A1*5 + A2*6 + A3*6 + A4*8 + A5*15 + Midterm*20 + Final*(15-0.5*TutorialsCompleted) + 0.5*TutorialsCompleted</code></li><li><code>AllExamsOnline = A1*5 + A2*6 + A3*6 + A4*8 + A5*15 + Midterm*5 + Final*(15-0.5*TutorialsCompleted) + 0.5*TutorialsCompleted</code></li><li><code>if (MidtermInPerson==TRUE &amp;&amp; FinalInPerson==TRUE)</code><ul><li><code>if (Assignments1to4 &lt; 45% OR Exams &lt; 50%)</code><ul><li><code>CourseGrade = min (Normal, 46)</code></li></ul></li><li><code>else</code><ul><li><code>CourseGrade = Normal</code></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><code>if (MidtermInPerson==FALSE &amp;&amp; FinalInPerson==TRUE)</code><ul><li><code>if (Assignments1to4 &lt; 45% OR OnlineMid &lt; 50%)</code><ul><li><code>CourseGrade = min (MidtermOnline/75*100, 46)</code></li></ul></li><li><code>else</code><ul><li><code>CourseGrade = MidtermOnline/75*100</code></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><code>if (MidtermInPerson==TRUE &amp;&amp; FinalInPerson==FALSE)</code><ul><li><code>if (Assignments1to4 &lt; 45% OR OnlineFinal &lt; 50%)</code><ul><li><code>CourseGrade = min (FinalOnline/85*100, 46)</code></li></ul></li><li><code>else</code><ul><li><code>CourseGrade = FinalOnline/85*100</code></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><code>if (MidtermInPerson==FALSE &amp;&amp; FinalInPerson==FALSE)</code><ul><li><code>if (Assignments1to4 &lt; 45% OR OnlineExams &lt; 50%)</code><ul><li><code>CourseGrade = min (AllExamsOnline/60*100, 46)</code></li></ul></li><li><code>else</code><ul><li><code>CourseGrade = AllExamsOnline/60*100</code></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><p> </p>

Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student's educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner's permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h3>Late Add Policy</h3><p>Students may not join the course after the add deadline has passed.</p><h3>Generative AI</h3><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
