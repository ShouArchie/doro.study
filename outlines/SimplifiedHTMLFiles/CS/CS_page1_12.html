  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>Modules will be released on a weekly basis. Some modules will take a bit longer and this extra time is built into the structure of the course. The reasoning for the weekly release is that we want to let ideas simmer and for you to remember content from previous modules. Modules will be released on Mondays and students will have approximately one week to go through the content of the module and the assignments.</p><p>All times are given in Eastern Time. See <a href="https://24timezones.com/time-zone/et">https://24timezones.com/time-zone/et</a> for more information about Eastern Time and <a href="http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_CA-ON.aspx">Ontario, Canada Time Converter</a> for more details on converting.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><th><strong>Module</strong></th><th><strong>Release Date</strong></th><th><strong>Wrap-Up Quiz Due Date</strong></th><th><strong>Assignment Due Date</strong></th></tr><tr><th>1</th><th>Monday January 6th, 2025 at 12:01am ET</th><th>Monday January 20th, 2025 at 11:59pm ET</th><th>Wednesday January 22nd, 2025 at 10:00am ET</th></tr><tr><th>2</th><th>Monday January 13th, 2025 at 12:01am ET</th><th>Monday January 27th, 2025 at 11:59pm ET</th><th>Wednesday January 29th, 2025 at 10:00am ET</th></tr><tr><th>3</th><th>Monday January 20th, 2025 at 12:01am ET</th><th>Monday February 3rd, 2025 at 11:59pm ET</th><th>Wednesday February 5th, 2025 at 10:00am ET</th></tr><tr><th>4</th><th>Monday January 27th, 2025 at 12:01am ET</th><th>Monday February 10th, 2025 at 11:59pm ET</th><th>Wednesday February 12th, 2025 at 10:00am ET</th></tr><tr><th>5</th><th>Monday February 3rd, 2025 at 12:01am ET</th><th>Monday February 24th, 2025 at 11:59pm ET</th><th>Wednesday February 26th, 2025 at 10:00am ET</th></tr><tr><th>6</th><th>Monday February 10th, 2025 at 12:01am ET</th><th>Monday March 10th, 2025 at 11:59pm ET</th><th>Wednesday March 12th, 2025 at 10:00am ET</th></tr><tr><th>7</th><th>Monday February 24th, 2025 at 12:01am ET</th><th>Monday March 17th, 2025 at 11:59pm ET</th><th>Wednesday March 19th, 2025 at 10:00am ET</th></tr><tr><th>8</th><th>Monday March 3rd, 2025 at 12:01am ET</th><th>Monday March 24th, 2025 at 11:59pm ET</th><th>Wednesday March 26th, 2025 at 10:00am ET</th></tr><tr><th>9</th><th>Monday March 10th, 2025 at 12:01am ET</th><th>Monday March 31st, 2025 at 11:59pm ET</th><th>Wednesday April 2nd, 2025 at 10:00am ET</th></tr><tr><th>10</th><th>Monday March 17th, 2025 at 12:01am ET</th><th>Friday April 4th, 2025 at 11:59pm ET</th><th>N/A</th></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3>Detailed Daily Course Schedule</h3><p>In this section we give an outline of approximately what we'll be covering on each day.

<p><strong>Important!</strong> You <strong>must</strong> pass the weighted exam average (at least 50%) of the midterm exam and the final exam to pass the course. Failure to pass the weighted exam average will result in a final grade of either 46% or your weighted exam average, whichever is lower.</p><p>Â </p><h3>Quiz Questions</h3><p>The quizzes will each have one attempt for non-programming problems and unlimited attempts for programming problems. The quizzes will be weighted equally (not according to how many problems solved per quiz as some quizzes might have more problems than others) so each quiz is worth 1% of your final grade. We will take your best 10 of 11, including the first warm-up quiz which is an orientation quiz to help you get acquainted with the website.</p><h3>Concept Checks</h3><p>Please note that concept checks are included here only for practice purposes. They will not be graded in any way. However, students are free to ask questions on discussion forums and in office hours.</p><p>Solutions to concept checks <strong>will not be provided to students</strong>. There are several reasons for this:</p><ol><li>We often don't have solutions to the problems. (Most of our test cases are done using the <code>check</code> module).</li><li>Out of concern for academic integrity this term and across different terms, we do not feel we should release either test data or solutions.</li><li>With respect to the above, more is learnt when you <strong>struggle to find the answer</strong> than is learnt when you quickly read a solution. In other words, active learning is far better than passive learning. Note that we will still post solutions to all assignments so you will get solutions to some problems. However it cannot be stressed enough that struggling to find the answer is worth more than being given it. This being said, staff is more than happy to help students get to the answer via office hours either before or after the due dates.</li></ol><p>In order to maintain a level of success in the course, students should not miss the completion of any modules.</p><h3>Assignments</h3><p>Assignments will be submitted to MarkUs through our online platform. The assignment that is marked is the last on time submitted version per question [on time according to the time on MarkUs which sometimes allows for a few minutes of grace period near the deadline]. Once you submit an assignment to MarkUs, you will receive an email consisting of basic tests that you passed or failed. Students should check their basic tests email to ensure that the code meets the specification exactly. We will not accept submissions that do not match our test output exactly.</p><p>There will be no extensions on assignments. If sick, please email our ISC a sick note to discuss alternate arrangements. Reweighting of assignments is not automatic even with a valid doctorâs note and is up to the sole discretion of the ISC or instructor to allow for reweighting.</p><p>Assignments are weighted evenly.</p><p>We will also only take your best 8 assignments of the first 9 assignments so you can miss a week if your workload becomes too onerous. However, <strong>if you join the course late and cannot complete Assignment 1 on time, this assignment will still count as your lowest assignment grade!</strong> In other words, you do not get to drop two assignments if you join after the deadline of Assignment 1.</p><p>Remark requests for assignments can be made up to one week after the assignment has been returned.</p><h3>Missed Assessments</h3><p><strong>There will be no extensions on assignments and late assignments will not be accepted!</strong> Make sure you understand what time zone you are in and when our due dates are in Eastern Time. If sick, please email our ISC a sick note to discuss alternate arrangements. Reweighting of assignments is not automatic even with a valid doctor's note and is up to the sole discretion of the ISC or instructor to allow for reweighting. We will only accept doctor's notes on at most 3 assignment components so make sure you are on top of your studies.</p><h3>Saving Work</h3><p>When you press on the <strong>Run Code</strong> button or the <strong>Submit Code</strong> button, your work will save. Please make sure you do this often! There is often no recourse if you fail to save your work so please run your code often!</p><h3>Academic Integrity</h3><p>Please note that if you do get caught in an academic integrity offense - the assignment you cheated on cannot be the dropped assignment.</p><h3>Late Adds</h3><p>This course does not support students adding after the two week add period as stipulated in the University Calendar under no exceptions. It is too difficult to miss one sixth of this course and catch up meaningfully.</p><p><strong>Up to date and more detailed information can be found on EdX (online.uwaterloo.ca)</strong></p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use ofÂ Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation ofÂ <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a>Â (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance).Â Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the authorâs original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental valuesÂ of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.).Â </p><p>You should be prepared to show yourÂ work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document.Â If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.Â </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the departmentâs administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about ârulesâ for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (TurnitinÂ®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. TurnitinÂ® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
