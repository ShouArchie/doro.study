<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>If you fail entirely to submit an assignment, a grade of zero will be recorded. Late assignments will have a penalty applied as discussed in the Assignments section below. The only exceptions are the following:</p><p>If you take a Short-Term Absence whose 2-day period covers an assignment deadline, your assignment deadline will be</p><p>correspondingly shifted back exactly two days. Please inform the instructor to make the deadline adjustment.</p><p>If you take a Self-Declared (COVID) Absence, which may cover up to 10 days, contact your instructor to arrange for appropriate accommodation. Depending on timing, circumstances, and preferences, we may either shift the deadline for you, or completely cancel that specific assignment for you as discussed in the next paragraph.</p><p>If you have another valid justification (e.g., illness with Verification of Illness Form [VIF], etc.) for missing an assignment deadline, the grade component of that assignment will be removed from your grade and the weight of the other assignments adjusted accordingly.</p><p>(e.g., if one assignment is missed, the remaining 3 assignments will each become worth 1/3 of the total assignment grade).</p><p><strong>Assignments</strong>:</p><p>Assignments will be made available through Crowdmark and LEARN. Check to ensure you are using the most recent version (if necessary, corrections will be made to the posted assignment and a corresponding announcement made on Piazza).</p><p>The assignments will consist of programming problems and analytical work. Your code is an important part of the assignment, and as such it should be readable and well-commented. Assignment figures and graphs should be carefully thought out and labelled to present the data and your conclusions in an effective and clear manner. Poor presentation of your work will result in a poor mark. Any code and algorithms you write should be sufficiently well documented through code comments or descriptions as to be readily understood. </p><p>There will be four assignments. Assignment submissions generally consist of both analytical/written work and programming problems. Late assignments received in the 24 hours following the due deadline will be marked, and receive (at most) 75% credit. Assignments submitted after 24 hours will not be marked. You cannot submit some questions on time and some questions late -- the whole assignment will be considered late in such a case.</p><p>Assignments and midterms will be returned electronically via Crowdmark. Complete written solutions will not be posted. You are instead encouraged to attend office hours to further discuss and review solutions as needed (or ask questions on Piazza).</p><p>Assignment/midterm marks will be posted on Crowdmark and LEARN. Notify the instructor or a TA immediately if you believe a mark was recorded incorrectly. The marks recorded on Crowdmark/LEARN are considered final two weeks after the grades are released for that specific course component.</p><p>Assignment Submission Procedures</p><p>You must submit your work in two parts:</p><p>1. Upload one or more PDF(s) to Crowdmark containing both your written/analytical work and your Maple implementation with the results/output included (including tables, figures, numerical data, etc). (i.e., the TA should be able to look at your PDF to immediately see your results and code, without needing to rerun the code themselves.)</p><p>2. Any and all Maple files you wrote/used to solve the programming problems should also be submitted electronically as a single ZIP file to the appropriate assignment Dropbox on LEARN. This code submission should allow the TAs to run your code if and when necessary to verify the results that your code produces.</p><p>If you submit one part before the deadline and one part after, by default the later of the two submission times will be used. Contact the instructor immediately if you have failed to submit [only] one part on time.</p><p><strong>Midterm</strong>:</p><p>The midterm exam has been scheduled for Tuesday, March 4 10:00-11:30 am (the usual time). </p><p><strong>Final Examination</strong>:</p><p>Students are strongly advised not to make any travel arrangements before the final examination schedule is posted. In the unusual event that the final examination is postponed, the final examination will be rescheduled for the day following the end of the regular examination schedule. Under no circumstances will alternate examinations be scheduled for students who have made travel arrangements that conflict with the final examination. Students must inform the registrar's office if they have a conflict in the final examination schedule, by the date posted on the registrar's web site. Note that there is a precise definition of conflict as defined by the registrar. Refer to: https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations.</p><p>The course instructor will then be contacted by the registrar's office to make appropriate arrangements. Under no circumstances will the instructor make alternate arrangements for a final examination unless given instructions by the registrar's office.</p><p><strong>Course Project</strong> (Grad students only):. </p><p>Graduate students are required to complete a course project. This could be a literature survey of a subtopic in numerical linear algebra, an empirical comparison/implementation of several related algorithms, an application of numerical linear algebra to another field, the design of a novel numerical linear algebra algorithm, or a theoretical analysis of the performance of a numerical linear algebra algorithm (new or old). A 1-2 page proposal will be due on Feb 10. The final project report will be due on the last day of classes.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignments and Midterm Marking Appeals:</strong></p><p>The names of TAs responsible for marking each question/component will be posted to Piazza after assignment grades are release. If you feel some element of your assignment/midterm was marked incorrectly, contact the relevant TA with a succinct, clear explanation of what specifically you would like reviewed, and why. (Vague, open-ended, or poorly justified requests for re-marking will be disregarded.) Requests for reviews of marking must be submitted within a week from the time the assignments/midterm grades are officially released. Note that your grade for the question in the remark request will be regraded, so the grade may go up or down.</p><p><strong>Assignment Screening</strong>:</p><p>No assignment screening software will be used in this course, although TAs will be watchful for (near-)duplicate assignment submissions and other academic integrity concerns.</p><p><strong>Administrative Policy:</strong></p><p><strong>Collaboration and Plagiarism:</strong></p><p>You are encouraged to discuss general assignment concepts with other individuals in the class. However, the submitted assignment must be your own work.</p><p>Plagiarism is representing the work of others as your own. Plagiarism on exams includes using unauthorized aids or communicating in any way with others (aside from instructors or TAs) during an examination. Plagiarism on assignments includes copying another student's solution and submitting it as your own, allowing another student to copy/adapt your solution, collaborating closely/excessively with another student, or obtaining solutions from any other source. Penalties for academic violations vary, but, for example, may include a zero on the assignment and a -5% to the course grade. Refer to Waterloo's Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties at: https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties. All academic offenses are reported to the</p><p>Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies and are recorded in the student's file. Subsequent academic offenses in the same course or in other courses will lead to more severe penalties, up to and including suspension and expulsion.</p><p>We encourage you to discuss general concepts and problems with classmates, TAs, and instructors. However, as noted above, the solution that you submit must be worked through by yourself and written in your own words. It is not acceptable to work on an assignment with someone else and then write it up individually. The only exceptions are assignments or projects which the instructor specifically designates as group activities. When discussing course matters with fellow students, do not take notes, and do not look at another person's partial solutions, or show them yours.</p><p><strong>Generative AI:</strong></p><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as [fill this in with your discipline-specific skills]. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of Policy 71 (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author's original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (ICAI, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes,</p><p>brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved</p><p>drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your</p><p>instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have</p><p>not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is</p><p>available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><p>Student Success Office for help with skills like notetaking and time management</p><p>Writing and Communication Centre for assignments with writing or presentations</p><p>AccessAbility Services for documented accommodations</p><p>Library for research-based assignments</p><p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructors, TAs, and/or the University of Waterloo.</p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><p>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</p><p>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</p><p>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams);</p><p>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</p><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student's educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner's permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository). Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through</p><p>the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Avoiding Academic Offenses</strong></p><p>Many students may be unaware of the line between acceptable and unacceptable academic behaviour, especially when discussing</p><p>assignments with classmates and using the work of other students. For information and tips related to academic integrity, students may</p><p>wish to refer to the Faculty of Mathematics Academic Integity page: https://uwaterloo.ca/math/academic-matters/academic-integrity</p><p><strong>Diversity</strong></p><p>It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, and that students learning needs be addressed both in and out of class. We recognize the immense value of the diversity in identities, perspectives, and contributions that students bring, and the benefit it has on our educational environment. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated.</p><p><strong>Health and Illness</strong></p><p>While Ontario and the University of Waterloo have long since suspended mandatory mask requirements in most settings, COVID-19</p><p>remains widespread and continues to evolve. The most severe COVID-related risks have lessened for many people, such as individuals</p><p>with fully up-to-date vaccinations. However, some risks of (re)infection and the potential for negative longer term health effects remain. For people with frequent or intense patterns of exposure (e.g., staff in or frequent visitors to healthcare settings) and/or certain types of home, caregiving, or other family circumstances and/or those who are immunocompromised or unable to receive vaccinations, the risk of (re)infection and significant negative health outcomes for themselves and family members may remain high. Traditional seasonal flus and colds can also have negative impacts on our collective health and learning to varying degrees. With these facts in mind, one way that everyone in our class can contribute to a safer and more equitable learning environment is to stay home when you are ill and, at minimum, wear a mask if you suspect you might be contagious. Course resources (lecture slides, course notes, etc.)</p><p>are made available online partly to facilitate catching up in such situations, and to reduce the need to attend class when you are sick.</p><p>For the most recent official University of Waterloo policy statements and updates related to COVID-19, refer to:</p><p>https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/</p><p><strong>Mental Health Resources</strong></p><p>If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, feelings like anxiety or depression, or any other concern regarding mental health, we strongly encourage seeking support. A range of on- and off-campus resources are available</p><p>including:</p><p>Campus Wellness: https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</p><p>Counselling Services: https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services</p><p>MATES: one-to-one peer support program offered by Federation of Students (FEDS) and Counselling Services:</p><p>https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/mates/</p><p>Health Services: https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services</p><p>Good2Talk (24/7): Free confidential help line for post-secondary students.
