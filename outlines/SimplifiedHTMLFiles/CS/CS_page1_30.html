<h4>Evaluation</h4><p>All assignments are individual assignments and group work or the use of Generative AI (see below) is NOT acceptable. </p><p>In order to pass CS 330, students are required to meet two requirements:</p><ol><li>pass the entire course (get at least a 50% overall grade) AND</li><li>pass the combined portion of the midterm + final exam, i.e. get 33 or more out of the 66 possible marks available.</li></ol><p>Otherwise, the course grade you would receive would be 46% or less<i>.</i></p><h4>Schedule of Exam and Assignment Due Dates</h4><p>Assignment 1:     Wednesday, Feb 5<sup>th</sup> at 5:00 pm</p><p>Assignment 2:     Monday Feb 24<sup>th</sup> at 5:00 pm</p><p>Midterm Exam:   Thursday, Mar 6<sup>th</sup>, 7:00-8:30 pm</p><p>Assignment 3:     Wednesday, Mar 19<sup>th</sup> at 5:00 pm</p><p>Assignment 4:     Wednesday, Apr 2nd at 5:00 pm</p><p>Final Exam:         Scheduled by Registrar’s Office</p><h4>Submission of Assignments</h4><p>Assignments will be submitted to, and graded using, Crowdmark. You will receive an email with a link to submit your assignment when each assignment is released. </p><h4>Late Assignments</h4><p>Late submissions will be accepted up to three days after due date. There will be a penalty of 10% per day for accepted late submissions. For example, an assignment that would have received a mark of 75% but was late by less than a day late would receive a mark of 75% - 10% = 65%.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Missed Quizzes, Assignments, Midterm or Final Exam</h4><p>If you have an self-declared absence due to a religious observance,  a COVID-19 related illness or a two-day absence, declare them in Quest (see<a href=" https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students"> https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students</a> for details) and let the instructor know within 24 hours that you want to apply it to a CS330 deliverable. For more information about short-term absences, see  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/academics/academics-undergraduate-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences">https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/academics/academics-undergraduate-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences</a>. </p><p>For other illnesses, submit the current version of the Verification of Illness Form to the instructor via email. The form is available at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/students/health-and-well-being/primary-care-appointments/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-vif-services">https://uwaterloo.ca/students/health-and-well-being/primary-care-appointments/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-vif-services</a>.</p><p>If you are in the Math Faculty then you must also submit a copy of the VIF to the MUO. For more details, see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations/submission">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations/submission</a>. Other faculties have their own rules for recording the VIF. It is up to you to inform yourself and follow your faculty’s VIF policy.</p><p>If you are ill seven days or less and an assignment is due during that period, you can receive an extension for the length of the absence. If it is more than seven days, the weight of the assignment will be shifted to the other assignments.</p><p>Assignments are a key component of this course, and you are expected to complete them all. Exceptions may be granted in the case of illness or other extenuating circumstances. However, no more than one assignments may be excluded from the final grade, regardless of your circumstances. If your circumstances are such that that level of accommodation is insufficient, consult an academic advisor to discuss your options.</p><p>There is no make-up for the midterm or final assessment. If you miss the midterm with a valid, documented reason, the weight will be shifted to the final assessment. If you miss the final assessment, you will be given an INC if there is a strong reason for missing it (generally a serious medical issue verified by a VIF).</p><p>There is no make-up for missed lecture quizzes. Instead I will drop the lowest 1/6 of the quiz results.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as designing information systems. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Regrading Request</h4><p>Requests for regrading will be accepted up to 14 days after students have received feedback for their assignments or midterm. Details of how to request a regrade will be posted in Piazza after the feedback has been published.</p><h4>Physical and Mental Health</h4><p>If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. See <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/ </a>for a list of on-campus supports and workshops.</p><h4>Diversity</h4><p>It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, and that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class. We recognize the immense value of the diversity in identities, perspectives, and contributions that students bring, and the benefit it has on our educational environment. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In particular:</p><ul><li>We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternate/preferred name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the semester so we may make appropriate changes to our records.</li><li>We will follow AccessAbility Services guidelines and protocols on how to best support students with different learning needs.</li></ul><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Contingency Plans</h4><p>CS330 will follow UW’s official decisions about course delivery. If UW becomes primarily online then any in-person components (such as in-person lectures, office hours, the midterm and the final exam) will be replaced by online versions.</p><p>If an instructor is sick or forced to isolate, lecture videos will be provided, and office hours may shift slightly and will be online.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, midterm and final exam); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience.  However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials.  However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><h4>Academic Freedom at the University of Waterloo<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><strong> </strong></a></h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33">Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6.</p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
