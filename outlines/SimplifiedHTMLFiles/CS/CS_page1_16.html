If a documented reason is approved, the weight of the missing assignment is distributed across the other assignments. If a Quest 48 hour self declared undocumented absence is used on an assignment, a 48 hour extension will be granted instead.  If a Quest 48 hour self declared undocumented absence is used on the midterm, the weight of the midterm will be shifted to the final assessment.  You may not miss more than 2 assignments over the term for any reason and still get credit for the course.  Please send your documentation and follow up email to the ISC, Scott King (sfking@uwaterloo.ca) before the deadline of the assignment.</p><h4>Assignment Submissions and Pickup:</h4><p>Assignments must be submitted using Marmoset, secret test results are available post-deadline.<br/>No assignments need to be picked up, new assignments appear in the downloads section after release.<br/>MOSS will be used to check for copied assignments / plagiarism.<br/> </p><h4>Remarking Policy</h4><p>Requests for remarking an assignment must be submitted to the ISA via the course email at most two weeks after the assignment is marked. Include any supporting evidence for your case. Minor code changes (~5 lines) to fix failing test cases may be permitted, but won't receive full marks. Major changes will be ignored. Re-marking is intended for situations where minor changes result in major mark boosts (i.e. a forgotten semicolon failed 4/5 secret cases).</p><p>To request a midterm remark, please fill this <a href="https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs138/RemarkRequestForm.pdf">form</a><a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs115/MidtermReMarkRequestFormAlt.pdf"> </a>and submitted it to the ISA via email.</p><h4>Rules for Group Work:</h4><p>There will be no group work allowed on any assessments (graded or not). Please see university policies about academic integrity.</p><h3>Piazza Guidelines:</h3><p>Here are some guidelines that you should keep in mind when posting items to Piazza:</p><p>Please remember that everything you post to Piazza is <strong>public</strong> - everyone enrolled in CS 138 will be reading it. As a result, in any posts you make, do <strong>NOT</strong> give away any details on how to do any of the assignments. This could be construed as <a href="https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs138/outline.shtml">cheating</a>, and you will be responsible as the poster. If you have questions about an assignment that requires you to give specific details of your solution, ask the tutor or the instructor by e-mail. If the tutor/instructor feels that posting it to Piazza is appropriate, he or she will do so.</p><p>Please try to use meaningful titles for all of your questions. Titles such as "Question about C++" or "Need help on Question 3" do not offer much insight into what your post is about. A better title would be something like "Iterating Over a Vector" or "Question About Maps."</p><p>Please consider tagging your question to help others who have questions similar to yours. Tagging is done by using the hash symbol (#) followed by a short string of text. In particular, if your question relates to a specific question on the assignment, for example Assignment 1 Question 3, try tagging your question #a1p3.</p><p>Keep posts to Piazza related to the course, concise, and topical. As all students are expected to read Piazza on a regular basis, try not to waste the time of readers.</p><p>Please <strong>read</strong> all questions and responses that are in Piazza before asking a question. If you ask a question that has already been answered, you are wasting everyone's time. In particular, please check for questions that have tags that relate to your problem.</p><p>Please don't post to Piazza things with little useful information to the readers. Posts like "I have the same question as this one just posted", or "I agree with this comment" provide little insights and waste everyone's time.</p><p>Please don't post complaints about the course to Piazza. If you have a concern about the course, please bring it to the instructor, tutor or the course ISC.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  MOSS (Measure Of Software Similarity):<br/><br/>Moss is an automatic system for determining the similarity of programs. As CS138 assignments are individual assignments (unless otherwise specified in the assignments), students are expected to finish them by themselves. As such, all submissions will be examined using MOSS.

<div>
<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as as writing and reading code, tracing, and algorithm design. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
