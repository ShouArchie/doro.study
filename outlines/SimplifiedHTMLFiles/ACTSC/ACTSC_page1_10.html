  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ACTSC 363:</div>
<p>Introduction to the collective risk model; models for loss frequency: (a, b, 0) and (a, b, 1) classes of distributions, compound distributions and mixtures; models for loss severity: exponential, gamma, lognormal, Pareto, Weibull, and mixtures; measures of distribution tails; impact of policy adjustments on loss frequency and severity; estimation of frequency and severity models.</p>

<h4>You need at least 60% in ACTSC 363 to fulfill ACTSC Honours requirements.</h4><p>60% in this course is a prerequisite for enrollment in ACTSC 431, which is also a required course. ACTSC 363 is an introductory property and casualty (P&amp;C) course and a prerequisite for more advanced and technical courses in the P&amp;C sequence: ACTSC 431, ACTSC 432, and ACTSC 463. </p><h4>This course helps fulfill FSA, FCAS, and FCIA requirements</h4><p>This course covers many learning objectives for the SOA FAM(-S) and ASTAM Exams, and CAS MAS-1 Exam. The course may treat topics differently than the SOA/CAS exams' syllabus, but can still help you prepare for the exams.</p><p>This course is accredited under the CIA accreditation program. More information on this program can be found on this <a href="https://www.cia-ica.ca/becoming-a-member/qualification-pathways/pathway-1/">CIA website</a> and this <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/current-undergraduate-students/canadian-institute-actuaries-cia-accreditation-society">UW website</a>.</p><p> </p>

While they will not be graded, completely them independently is critical for reinforcing your understanding of the underlying concepts. I highly recommend you to keep up with each chapter, and attempt each problem without looking at the provided solutions since there can often be multiple ways to solve a given problem.</p><p>Concepts build quickly on top of each other in this course, so it is essential to ask for clarification as soon as possible. You can ask questions before/during/after each lecture, or during instructor/TA office hours.</p><p>I also recommend Dan Wolczuk's <a href="https://wolczuk.com/learning.html">Learning How to Learn Series</a> and these <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/learning-support/quick-tips-and-tools">Student Success Office resources</a> related to time management, study skills, and stress management, among other topics.</p><h4>Assignments will be released on Crowdmark two weeks before the due dates.</h4><p>Your solutions to assignments also need to be submitted on <strong>Crowdmark</strong>. Detailed instructions for assignments will be provided when they are released. Since the intent of the assignments is to have you practice applying the material (and <i>supplement</i> the practice problem sets), they will be graded based on a mix of completion and accuracy.</p><h4>Midterm coverage and extra office hours will be announced one week in advance.</h4><p>The material covered in each exam will be announced on <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home">LEARN</a> one week before each assessment. The final exam covers all topics introduced in the course.</p><h4>Your exam seats will be assigned.</h4><p>Your seat location will be assigned a few days before each exam and can be found on <a href="https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/teaching/schedule">Odyssey</a>.</p><h4>You have 3 days to request an assessment regrade.</h4><p>Assessments will be graded and returned within one week using <a href="https://crowdmark.com/">Crowdmark</a>, and the solutions will be posted on <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home">LEARN</a>. You will have 3 days to file a regrading request. Instructions on how to file a request will be posted on <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home">LEARN</a> with the return of each assessment. The instructor/TA reserves the right to review the grading of your entire assessment, and after the review, your resulting grade can be higher, lower, or stay the same.</p><h4>Follow these policies for accommodation due to illness or extenuating circumstances.</h4><p>If you experience a significant illness, ongoing medical condition, or other circumstances that prevent you from meeting academic obligations, please refer to the Faculty of Mathematics' <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/absence-declarations">Absence Declarations</a> webpage for guidance on faculty policies. The weight of missed assessments due to approved declared absences will be shifted to the final exam. </p><p>Students who have been unable to engage with their courses for two weeks or longer, whether by illness or extenuating circumstances, should follow up with their individual instructors and their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/academic-advising">academic advisor</a> to assess whether maintaining their current course load is still viable.</p><p>For illness during the final exam, please refer to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/incomplete-process">Math Faculty’s INC policy</a>. If you miss the final exam for a valid reason, you can request a grade of INC and write the exam the next time the course is taught. Typically, a grade of INC is only awarded to a student who has done coursework well enough that they could reasonably be expected to pass the course.<strong> INCs will not be granted if you miss both midterms.</strong></p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
