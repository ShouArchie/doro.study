  Instructor &amp; TA (Teaching Assistant) Information
</h2>
<div>
<h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3><p>Howdy y'all! My name is Austin and I am very excited to be your instructor this term. I am a third year doctoral candidate and I have been a TA and given lectures for this course multiple times. I hold an ASA and I received a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics from The University of Texas at Austin. LTAM was my favorite exam, and I scored a 10 on it.</p><h3><strong>Contacting Austin</strong></h3><p>The best way to get ahold of me is my university email address which is acriisdu@uwaterloo.ca or on our course Piazza page. I will not be able to meet with you in my office on campus since it is a shared working space with another doctoral candidate, and for your privacy I would prefer to meet with you in our scheduled office hours or by appointment.</p><p><strong><u>I will be completely unavailable on any date during this term on which the Texas Longhorns are playing a football game.</u></strong></p><h3><strong>Office Hours</strong></h3><p>I will hold office hours weekly in M3 2101 on Wednesdays 8:45-9:45 A.M. (the hour before class), or by appointment. Teams appointments can also be made outside of these hours by email. <i><strong>These hours will be held except for February 5 when I will be in Brussels for an invited talk and March 12 when I will be at the Orlando FAC to be made an FSA</strong></i>.</p><p><strong><u>What is the purpose of office hours?</u></strong></p><ul><li>Ask specific questions regarding concepts or practice problems you're struggling with</li><li>Get help with the course material in general, even if you don't know what specific questions you may have</li><li>Stop in to say hi (either by yourself or with peers) and chat</li></ul><h3><strong>Discussion Board and Email</strong></h3><p>Our Piazza Discussion Board can be found at</p><p>https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/actsc331</p><p>Please ensure you register for the Piazza board right away as all <strong>content related questions will only be answered via Piazza</strong>. Before posting a question, search the existing posts to see if your question has already been asked by another student.</p><p>Non-content related questions that are of a personal nature can be asked by emailing me directly.</p><p>You can expect a response from me within <strong>approximately 24 hours</strong> <strong>during the week</strong>. Don't count on me to monitor my email or Piazza on evenings or weekends. Our TA will also be monitoring the Piazza forum regularly.</p><p> </p>

<h2><strong>Course Activities</strong></h2><h3><strong>Lectures</strong></h3><p>Slides will be posted as <strong>unannotated versions</strong> prior to lectures. My rationale is that deep learning typically requires the physical act of writing things down and annotating in your own words. I strongly encourage you to print out and annotate (or annotate on a tablet, or make your own notes on plain paper) the slides during class.</p><h3><strong>Practice Problems </strong></h3><p>Practice problem sets will be posted on LEARN every few weeks. You should attempt the questions before reviewing solutions to solidify your understanding of the concepts in lecture. Full solutions will be posted approximately 1 week after the problems are released. A list of recommended problems from the textbook will also be posted for each chapter.<i> Practice is crucial to your success in this course and in SOA exams. You have to understand patterns in wording that the SOA uses and how to approach a variety of problems, some of which you may not completely understand until you see examples. This is perfectly natural and part of the learning process to become a great actuary.</i></p>

<p><strong><u>The Assignments</u></strong> for this course solely consist of the exams. I am designing it this way because a major part of the course is your preparation to take the actuarial exams corresponding to the content we cover here. Treating my lectures as your learning material and the midterms and final as your practice exams for the SOA exam is a good way to think about what we're doing here.</p><p><strong><u>The Bonus</u></strong> consists of opportunities during lectures to contribute to the class discussion. This is an example based class where a lot of what we talk about in lecture is immediately applied. There are a multitude of "Checkpoints" throughout the lectures where I will ask you to contribute either by responding casually, giving an equation, or providing a numerical solution. When a response is given (correct or incorrect!) your name will be written in the annotated course notes for a later tally. Each contribution that you make will earn you 1 bonus point applied directly to your final grade, up to a maximum of five total possible bonus points. (e.g. if you contribute during lecture 6, 24, or 73 times you will receive 5 bonus marks on your final grade. If you contribute 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 times you would receive that many bonus marks on your final grade. If you have a final score of 100 in the class the bonus marks <strong><u>do not</u></strong> grant you a score in excess of 100.) This is to encourage your engagement and participation to aid everyone's learning experience. The best way to learn this stuff is by practicing with concepts and seeing examples. This helps us all do that together.</p><p><strong>If you miss any of the two midterms for any reason, the weight will automatically be shifted to the final exam.</strong> I understand that there are many reasons which a VIF may not cover that are perfectly valid for being unable to take an exam. I have had days like that myself, and so if for any reason you don't show up, understand that your weight for that exam will be transferred to the final. (e.g. If you have two events occur causing you to miss Midterm 1 and Midterm 2, your final exam will be worth 100% of your grade in our course. If you have an event causing you to miss exactly one of Midterm 1 or Midterm 2, your grade will be determined based on a 25% weight in the exam you took and a 75% weight on the final exam. I will do this regardless of VIF submission.) See the Administrative Policy section below for the policy for absence during the final exam.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
