  Instructor &amp; TA (Teaching Assistant) Information
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong><u>Office hours</u></strong></p><p>Office hours will be discussed in class to maximise availability. For now, I will be available every Wednesday after class, from 1:30pm to 2:30pm (M3 4113) to answer any questions you may have on the course material. These office hours will be held in my office (M3 4113). The first office hour will be held on Wednesday January 15th, 2025 and the last one on April 2nd, 2025. There is no office hour held during Reading Week (i.e., on Wednesday February 19th, 2025). Additional office hours may be posted on Learn before exams and assignment due dates. </p><p>Outside of these office hours, I encourage you to reach out to me by email at any time during the semester. I will do my very best to get back to you as soon as I can. </p><p><strong><u>Connecting and getting help</u></strong></p><p>I encourage you to ask questions during lectures so that you get the most out of them. Additionally, I will assign recommended problems on a weekly basis to supplement the learning done in class. It is my expectation that you will work on all these recommended problems in a timely manner. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you need any assistance. </p><p><strong><u>Course webpage</u></strong></p><p>D2L Course Environment - learn.uwaterloo.ca</p><p>Please regularly take a look at the News Announcement on Learn as this will be my primary method to communicate with you. All course material (lecture notes, recommended problems) will be posted under Content on Learn.</p><p><strong><u>Tutorials</u></strong></p><p>I do not plan to make use of the tutorials at the moment, although they may be used for content clarification and problem solving sessions if necessary. In case of a lecture cancellation, the tutorial timeslot may be used to make up for a missed lecture. Tutorials have been tentatively scheduled on January 6 (although obviously on the first day back it will not be used), January 20, February 3, March 3, March 17 and March 31 in QNC 1507 from 1:30pm to 2:20pm. I will post an announcement on Learn if I ever plan to make use of any of these tutorial timeslots (most probably if I get requests for problem solving sessions).</p>

<h2>
  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>

<tr>
<td>propose various probability models for the aggregate claim of an insurance portfolio</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>calculate distributional quantities of interest (mean, variance, VaR, ....) for these aggregate claim models</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>apply simulation methods in actuarial loss modelling</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>understand the basic principles of reinsurance to help insurers mitigate the risks of a portfolio of insurance</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<div>No materials required.</div>
<div>
<p>There is no mandatory textbook for this course. The lecture notes posted on Learn (under Content in the folder Lecture notes) will be the primary reference for this course.</p><p>However, if you'd like to get a second reference text, my recommendation is Loss Models: From Data to Decisions (5th Edition) by Klugman, Panjer and Willmot. In fact, there are a lot of similarities between the lecture notes and this reference text. Note that as a UW student, you can access an electronic copy of the book at https://lib.uwaterloo.ca/web/</p>

<ol><li>Your final mark must be at least 50% to pass the course.</li><li>It is strongly recommended that you follow the Weekly Schedule plan posted on Learn in the folder Course Information. The Weekly Schedule plan was designed to keep learning at a manageable pace throughout the semester.</li><li>Requests for re-grading an examination must be made within 1 week after the papers are returned to you. No request will be accepted after this deadline.</li><li>In the event that you are unable to write an examination, you should inform your instructor by email as soon as it is possible for you to do so. In your email, please provide the reason(s) why you are unable to write the examination. Additionally, you must follow the entire procedure as outlined by the Faculty of Mathematics at https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations. You will not be eligible for an accommodation until all requirements are met.</li><li>The final decision to grant or not a special accommodation rests with your instructor. In the event you miss a test and your instructor accepts to provide accommodation for the missed test, its test weight will be transferred to the final exam. Only in exceptional circumstances will a student be allowed to transfer both test weights to the final exam. Finally, in the event you miss the final exam and your instructor accepts to provide accommodation for the missed final exam, the final exam will be an oral exam that will take place during the final exam period at a time that does not conflict with your other final exams. More details will be shared with you in the event this situation applies.</li></ol><p> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
