<h3>Course instructor</h3><p><strong>Mirabelle Huynh</strong>, Associate Professor, Teaching Stream, PhD, FSA, FCIA, CERA<br/>m3huynh@uwaterloo.ca</p><h3>Teaching assistant (TAs)</h3><p>Ziyue Shi<br/>z85shi@uwaterloo.ca</p><h3>Instructor &amp; TA office hours</h3><p><strong>Fridays, 4:30-5:30 PM in M3 3109 </strong>with M. Huynh</p><p>TA office hours will be held in the week leading up to each of Midterm 1, Midterm 2, and the Final Exam. Specific times will be announced on LEARN. </p><p>No office hours will run during Reading Week (Feb 15–23). </p><h2>How to get support</h2><p>We’re here to help you succeed! There are several ways to get assistance:</p><h4>1. Piazza discussion board</h4><p>The <a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/actsc232">Piazza discussion board</a> is your online resource for course-related questions.</p><p><strong>Who responds:</strong> The instructor/TA will monitor the board and respond to questions. We aim to respond within 24 hours on weekdays or by the next business day on weekends and holidays.</p><p><strong>When to use Piazza vs. instructor office hours:</strong> Piazza is ideal for mild to moderate confusion about specific problems. If you're stuck on several problems (more than three per week) or have complex questions (e.g., "Can someone walk me through Problem 4.3?"), I suggest attending instructor office hours for more personalized support, allowing for follow-up questions and more comprehensive explanations. </p><p><strong>Piazza posting guidelines:</strong></p><ul><li>You can post anonymously to classmates by selecting "Show up as Anonymous," but instructors and TAs will see your name.</li><li>Use a clear subject line (e.g., "Problem Set 1 Q3(b)").</li><li>Indicate what you've tried and where you're stuck (e.g., "I thought the solution should be ... but my answer differs from the provided solution. What went wrong?").</li><li>If our response doesn’t fully address your question, reply and explain what you’re still confused about—don’t hesitate to ask follow-up questions. If you remain unclear after the back-and-forth exchange, attend instructor office hours for face-to-face support, which can often provide more nuanced explanations.</li><li>We encourage you to respond to classmates' questions. Teaching others is one of the best ways to learn and helps you build written communication skills valued by employers.</li></ul><h4>2. Instructor office hours</h4><p>I encourage you to join my weekly office hours. You can ask detailed questions about lecture content, seek help with specific problems, and discuss learning strategies.</p><p>If the first midterm doesn’t go as planned, don’t worry—office hours can be valuable for refining your learning strategies to improve in the rest of the course.</p><h4>3. Instructor email for personal matters</h4><p>For questions about personal circumstances (e.g., accommodations, scheduling conflicts) or to provide course feedback, please email your instructor directly.</p><h4>4. Other resources</h4><p>I highly recommend Dan Wolczuk's <a href="https://wolczuk.com/learning.html">How to Learn Series</a>, along with resources from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources">Student Success Office </a>on time management, study skills, and stress management.</p><p>If you are managing personal or academic challenges, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a> and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/academic-advising">academic advisors</a> are available to help with accommodations and course planning.</p>

<h3>Strategies for success</h3><p><strong>Attend all lectures</strong>: Regular attendance helps you grasp key concepts and stay on track with the material.</p><p><strong>Complete practice problems</strong>: Work through the assigned textbook problems (posted on <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home">LEARN</a>) multiple times. Independent practice is essential for developing and self-assessing your understanding. Compare your solutions critically with the provided answers to identify gaps in knowledge. I highly recommend watching <a href="https://wolczuk.com/video.html?id=_wlvN523tY4&amp;title=Effective%20Practice">Dan Wolczuk's video on effective practice</a>.</p><p><strong>Solve problems promptly</strong>: As new concepts are introduced, solve related textbook problems to reinforce your understanding while the material is fresh.</p><p><strong>Ask questions early</strong>: Don’t wait if something is unclear. Ask questions during or after lectures, on Piazza, or during instructor/TA office hours to get timely clarification.</p><h3>Assessments vary in difficulty based on their purpose.</h3><p><strong>Tutorial problem sets</strong>: Designed as learning tools to help you gauge your understanding of lecture material and stay current with content. </p><p><strong>Midterms</strong>: Serve as both learning and diagnostic tools. They assess whether you have a weak, satisfactory, or strong grasp of course content. Midterms include a few challenging questions to test your ability to apply concepts to more complex, unfamiliar scenarios, making them more difficult than quizzes. Reviewing your graded midterms offers a valuable learning opportunity.</p><p><strong>Final Exam</strong>: Primarily diagnostic, slightly more challenging than midterms, and designed to evaluate your overall understanding of the course material.</p><h3>You must use a nonprogrammable calculator. </h3><p>A financial calculator is not required, and all questions are designed so that full marks can be achieved with a standard non-financial calculator.</p><h3>Assessment coverage will be announced one week before each assessment.</h3><p>The material covered in each assessment will be announced on <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home">LEARN</a> one week before each assessment. The final exam covers all topics introduced in the course.</p><h3>Your seat will be assigned for the midterms and final exam, but not for tutorials.</h3><p>Your seat location will be assigned a few days before the assessment and can be found <a href="https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/teaching/schedule">here</a>.</p><h3>You have one week to request a regrade.</h3><p>All assessments will be graded within one week, and the solutions will be posted on <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home">LEARN</a>. You will have one week to file a regrading request. Instructions on how to file a request will be posted on <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home">LEARN</a> with the return of each assessment. The instructor/TA reserves the right to review the grading of your entire assessment, and after the review, your resulting grade can be higher, lower, or stay the same. </p><h3>Requests for academic considerations due to absence</h3><p>If you experience a significant illness, ongoing medical condition, or other circumstances that prevent you from meeting academic obligations, please refer to the Faculty of Mathematics’ <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/absence-declarations">Absence Declarations</a> webpage for guidance on faculty policies. The weight of missed assessments due to approved declared absences will be shifted to the final exam. </p><p>Students who have been unable to engage with their courses for two weeks or longer, whether by illness or extenuating circumstances, should follow up with their individual instructors and their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/academic-advising"><u>academic advisor</u></a> to assess whether maintaining their current course load is still viable. </p><p>For situations preventing you from completing the course, consult the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/incomplete-process">Faculty of Mathematics' INC process webpage </a>for more information. </p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
