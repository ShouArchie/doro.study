<p><strong>MOBIUS ASSIGNMENTS:</strong> Mobius assignments are auto-generated (algorithmic) questions that are test you on each section of the material. </p><p>As you complete the section, you will do a Mobius assignment.  It is marked by the system and you are provided with feedback.  You may do these as many times as you wish, and you get the highest mark attained. </p><p>On the class schedule (see the end of the outline), there are recommended due dates for each Mobius assignment.  These dates largely correspond to when you should be done a given week’s work.  I feel that you should attempt them after you finish the week’s studying to see how you are grasping the materials.  If you do not get to do the Mobius assignment by that date, it will remain open until the last day of lectures.  This class and learning the materials is iterative in nature. You may completely understand the week 3 material after doing the week 6 sections.  You may go back and redo the week 3 Mobius assignment and improve your mark. </p><p>Be careful, however, that you do not allow this freedom to neglect the timely study of the materials.  You still have assignments and tests to write, and those dates are set and will not be moved.</p><p><strong>TESTS:</strong> There will be five (5) tests and the lowest mark will be dropped for average calculations.  Tests are done in lecture time and in the lecture room, unless you are told otherwise.  <strong>No online test alternative will be made available.</strong></p><p><strong>ASSIGNMENTS:</strong> There will be five (5) assignments and all marks are included in the final grade calculation.   </p><p>These written assignments will be distributed through Crowdmark.  They will be distributed a minimum of 5 days before they are due, and they will be submitted via Crowdmark.  If for some reason an assignment is not distributed on time, the due date will be adjusted accordingly,</p><p><strong>FINAL EXAMINATION:</strong> The final exam is cumulative. <u>You must receive a passing mark on the final examination to pass the class.</u> It will be written on campus in a time slot determined by the Registrar’s Office.  I have no control over when that happens.</p><p>If you do not pass the final exam, then the grade you will receive will be the lower of the calculated mark or your final examination mark.</p><p><strong>POLICY REGARDING MISSED QUIZZES OR ASSIGNMENTS</strong></p><p>I have a very liberal missed quiz or assignment policy.  Here it is simply put:</p><ol><li>If you wrote all 5 quizzes, I drop your lowest quiz mark when calculating your final grade.</li><li>If you missed one quiz for any reason, I drop that no show mark when calculating your final grade since a missed quiz is a mark of zero.  I don’t care why you missed it.  Illness.  Home for Easter and can’t get back to campus on time…whatever.  It doesn’t matter to me.  It is the dropped quiz.</li><li>If you missed more than one quiz for any reason, I drop one of the no shows when calculating your final grade.  The other no shows go on the final.  Again, I don’t care why you missed them.  In all cases, you will only get 1 dropped quiz maximum.</li></ol><p>So, if you think you will get your lowest mark of the quizzes you wrote dropped, that is not how it works.  If you wrote 3, for example, and got 30%, 70% and 80%, then those marks are used for your grade.  One missed quiz is dropped and one missed is moved to the final exam.</p><p>In more detail:</p><ol><li>Wrote 5 = lowest dropped</li><li>Wrote 4 = no show dropped</li><li>Wrote 3 = one no show dropped, other no show on the final</li><li>Wrote 2 = one no show dropped, other no shows on the final</li><li>Wrote 1 = one no show dropped, other no shows on the final</li><li>Wrote 0 = one no show dropped, other no shows on the final</li></ol><p>That’s how it works.  If you have questions, please let me know.</p>

  University Policy

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
