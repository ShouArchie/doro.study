<p><strong>ACTSC 455 vs 855: </strong>If you are taking ACTSC 855, you may have additional or slightly different questions on the assignments, midterm, and final exam. You will also be responsible for doing a project. More details about this will follow near the end of term.</p><p><strong>Tutorials: </strong>Class sessions on Wednesdays will be used for interactive activities to both enhance and assess your comprehension of the course material, each worth 1% (lowest 2 dropped.)</p><p><strong>Assignments: </strong> There will be 5 written assignments throughout the term. Assignments are tentatively due at 10 pm on: <strong>Jan 31, Feb 14</strong>,<strong> Mar 7</strong>, <strong>Mar 21, </strong>and<strong> Apr 4</strong>. Assignments will include significant writing and/or computing components, and clear communication and documentation of work is important. Assignments may be completed in pairs or groups of three.</p><p><strong>Midterm: </strong>There will be one midterm test on <strong>Fri Feb 28</strong> from <strong>6:30 – 8:00 pm </strong>in<strong> MC 1056</strong>.  It will cover the first half of the course, up to the end of profit testing.</p><p><strong>Oral Exam:</strong> There will be a short (15-minute) one-on-one exam scheduled individually at a time that works for you. It will be open-book and you can bring in any materials you like. This is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your knowledge (and more importantly, your ability to communicate that knowledge) of the course material. More details about this will follow.</p><p><strong>Final Exam: </strong>There will be a usual 2.5-hour final exam during the exam period (Apr 9 – 25). </p><p><strong>You must have a passing weighted average for the Exam component (Midterm, Oral, Final) to pass the course.</strong></p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Regrading requests:</strong> You can ask for an assessment to be re-graded within 7 days of receiving the marked assessment, by submitting a written note with your concerns to the TA.</p><p><strong>Missed Assessments:</strong> If you miss an Assignment deadline due to illness or emergency, a 48-hour extension will be provided (there is no need to use a 2-day or self-declared absence for assignment deadlines.) If you miss a Tutorial activity, depending on the week you may be offered the chance to complete the activity on your own outside of class time and submit for full credit. The lowest two Tutorial activities are dropped. If you miss the Midterm due to illness or emergency, please contact Diana for an arrangement. The most likely accommodation will be an individual oral exam on the assessment material, rather than shifting weight to other assessments. If you miss your Oral Exam time, we will reschedule.</p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
