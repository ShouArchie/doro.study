<div>
<div>
<div>ACTSC 454 / ACTSC 854:</div>
<p>Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen estimators for survival functions. Kernel density models. Validation of mortality tables. Estimators for Markov multiple state transition intensities. Longevity models, including deterministic and stochastic models such as Lee-Carter and Cairns-Blake-Dowd.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>The objective of this course is to introduce statistical models for survival data. Building upon the concepts of ACTSC 232 and 331, we discuss estimation with both empirical and parametric models. Discussion of mortality improvement follows, including the introduction of stochastic longevity models.</p><p>ACTSC 854 students learn the same material as 454 students, but with extra or enhanced assessments.</p><h2><strong>Course Activities</strong></h2><h3>Lectures</h3><p>Lectures are given on the board for you to copy down, and I encourage an interactive class atmosphere. Please do not hesitate to ask questions so that we can all learn together and make learning as active (and enjoyable) as possible. </p><h3>Tutorials</h3><p>The scheduled tutorial time slot (Bi-weekly Fridays 10:30 - 11:20am in Phy 313) will only be used if needed for make-up lectures, or additional examples if needed. You can assume there are no tutorials unless one is specifically announced in class and on LEARN. </p>

<h3>Remark Requests </h3><p>You may appeal the way an assessment was marked by submitting a request within <strong><u>1 week</u></strong> of it being returned. Requests must be submitted in writing by email.</p><h3>Illness / Short Term Absences Policy</h3><p>If you are ill, you must submit a VIF indicating severe illness. (If you are self-isolating due to flu-like or COVID-19 symptoms, you can instead complete the self-declaration form in Quest). Details can be found here: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/absence-declarations">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/absence-declarations </a></p><ul><li>If you are ill for the midterm, you must provide satisfactory documentation within <u>48 hours</u> by emailing the instructor and submitting a copy of the VIF to the MUO. For satisfactory documentation, <strong>the midterm weight will be shifted to the final exam.</strong></li><li>In almost all cases, unless there are significant extenuating circumstances, there will be <strong>no shifting of weight for the assignments. </strong>This is because the assignments will be available for an approximately two-week period prior to the deadline, and they are submitted online. If you have significant extenuating circumstances, please email me to discuss appropriate accommodations to the late policy.</li><li>If you are ill for the final exam, you will receive an INC grade and be required to complete the exam during the next course offering, <strong>if you are achieving a passing grade going into the exam.</strong> Further, you <strong>must have written the midterm</strong> to qualify for an INC if you miss the final exam. If not, a grade of DNW will be assigned.</li></ul><p>The above accommodations also apply to self-declared short-term absences.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><h2><strong>Mental Health Support</strong></h2><p>The Faculty of Math encourages students to seek out mental health support if needed.</p><p>On-campus Resources:</p><ul><li>Campus Wellness <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</a></li><li>Counselling Services: <a href="mailto:counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca/">counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca/</a> 519-888-4567 ext 32655</li><li>MATES: one-to-one peer support program offered by Federation of Students (FEDS) and Counselling Services: <a href="mailto:mates@uwaterloo.ca">mates@uwaterloo.ca</a></li><li>Health Services: located across the creek from the Student Life Centre, 519-888-4096.</li></ul><p>Off-campus Resources: </p><ul><li>Good2Talk (24/7): Free confidential help line for post-secondary students.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
