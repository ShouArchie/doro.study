  Texts / Materials

<p><i>Note: Any prices provided in course outlines are best estimates based on recent online prices and do not include shipping or taxes. Prices may vary between retailers.</i></p>
</div>
<div>No materials required.</div>
<div>
<p>There is no textbook required for this course. The lectures, course notes, and supplementary learning material, along with the assignments and concept quizzes, are sufficient resources to enable a thorough understanding of course concepts. Students are encouraged to seek their own supplementary resource material (web-based or otherwise) if they so desire.</p><p>If you wish to use a published textbook as an additional reference resource on linear regression (as well as on some logistic regression content), one such text I could recommend is <i>Introduction to Regression Modelling, </i>by B. Abraham and J. Ledolter (Brooks/Cole pub., any edition). The text uses the same notation and terminology as that used in the lectures and lecture notes, and for the most part <u>roughly</u> follows the same content order as presented in lectures. </p>

To provide contingency for unforeseen circumstances, the instructor reserves the right to modify course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines if/when necessary. In the event of such challenges, the instructor will work with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty.</p><p>In the event of short-term cancellation due to instructor illness/unavailability or longer term university-wide cancellation of in-person classes and assessments:</p><ul><li>in-person lectures will be substituted with (asynchronous) online lesson delivery (narrated Mobius slides)</li><li>In-person concept quizzes will be replaced with online quizzes</li><li>the midterm exam will be replaced with an online version to be written at the same scheduled time</li></ul><p><strong>R Programming Language: </strong>We will use R for assignments, and R output in the lesson content. Both R and the more user-friendly environment, RStudio, are available as a free download. An installation guide for R and RStudio, as well as an introduction to RStudio and the R language are posted on the class website (LEARN). You will be responsible for understanding and interpreting R output on the concept quizzes, midterm, and final exam. <strong>The midterm may also include a component in which you are expected to fit and analysis regression models using R. </strong></p><p><strong>Assignments</strong>: Assignments are to be submitted via Crowdmark by 11:59 pm (midnight) of the deadline date. See the schedule above or the LEARN calendar for deadline dates. You are welcome to work with classmates, <strong><u>but you must each submit your own assignment and create/provide your own output</u></strong>. Answers to questions requiring verbal explanations <strong><u>must be in your own words</u></strong>. Any individuals from whom you have received assistance or to whom you have provided assistance <strong><u>must be acknowledged on the cover page of your assignment</u></strong>.</p><p><strong>Concept Quizzes</strong>: Quizzes<strong> </strong>will consist of two parts. Part 1, worth 1%, consists of an individual, closed book, proctored component. After Part 1 is submitted, students will write Part 2 of the quiz, worth 1.5%, for which they are encouraged to discuss the questions with classmates and ask questions of the instructor. Some of the questions may be the same for both parts. For Part 2, students may use their lecture notes and any ACTSC 623 W25 LEARN content. Electronic devices (e.g., laptops, smartphones, etc.) may be used only to access their lecture notes and/or ACTSC 623 W25 LEARN content. Varied format (multiple choice/select, true/false, short answer, …). Additional information will be posted on LEARN prior to each quiz.</p><p><strong>Midterm Exam: </strong>To be held in person on Friday, March 7. Time TBD. Proctored, short answer. Additional information on content coverage and format will be posted well prior to the examination date.</p><p><strong>Final Exam: </strong>Held in-person during final exam examination period. Proctored, comprehensive, short answer, closed book. Additional information on content coverage and format will be posted well prior to the examination date.</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
