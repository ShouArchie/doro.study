  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>HHUM 263 / ITALST 263:</div>
<p>This course will focus on representations of contagion and illness in Italian literature and film. Covering such topics as the portrayal of the Bubonic Plague in 14th-century novelle, Renaissance descriptions of syphilis, Verist and Neo-realist stories about contagion and poverty, and the projection of social malaise in art films, students will assess the ways in which disease is depicted in primary texts. Students will gain familiarity with contemporary contagion theories, as well as historicization and cultural criticism of literary and cinematic accounts of disease. In this course students will consider the psycho-social impact of contagion and disease from multiple perspectives - near and far, past, and present.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Late Work Policy</h4><p>All coursework is expected to be submitted by its due date. Penalty for late essay submissions: 10% first day, and 5% per day thereafter, including weekends. The dropbox in LEARN is designed to accept only work submitted on time: late tests and discussions cannot be accepted. </p><p>Whether you miss a test, quiz, essay deadline, or discussion, <strong>you will need</strong> a University of Waterloo Verification of Illness form to be considered for accommodation. Please respectfully communicate your situation to the instructor immediately or, at the very least, as soon as possible; late requests for accommodation will be difficult to substantiate or document <strong>and may be refused by the instructor</strong>.</p><p><strong>Please note</strong> that <strong>it is your responsibility </strong>to regularly consult the Course Schedule, your email, course content, announcements, discussions, and all relevant sections of the course in LEARN, and to annotate important dates in your planner.</p><h4>Student Conduct</h4><ul><li>After an assessment is returned, students should wait 24 hours to digest feedback before contacting their evaluator; to ensure a timely response, reach out within 7 days.</li><li>Students are expected to follow online etiquette expectations provided below.</li><li>All course materials created by the instructor <strong>are copyrighted and cannot be sold/shared</strong>.</li><li>Recordings of online sessions are not permitted (audio or video) without explicit permission.</li><li>Permitted recordings are not to be distributed.</li><li>All recorded sessions will remain within the course site or unlisted, if streamed.</li><li>Students may be asked to take an academic integrity pledge before some assessments.</li></ul><p>Please be aware that St. Jerome’s University has specific regulations in place concerning appropriate behaviour, both academic and otherwise.  You are expected to be familiar with these regulations and to abide by them at all times (for policies, visit to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/">Secretariat</a> site).  Please read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33">Section 33</a> concerning ethical behaviour.</p><h4>Email Policy</h4><p>Students are expected to utilize email appropriately. This implies that appropriate, respectful language should be used at all times. Students are also expected to stay abreast of communication about the course through lectures, links, and announcements posted in LEARN, and are therefore expected to log in to LEARN regularly. Emails from students are most welcome; however, please make sure that the answer to your question(s) is NOT already included in the Course Outline or in LEARN, <strong>before</strong> emailing your instructor. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the information in your Course Schedule and with the use of the online websites throughout the course.</p><p>For all other questions, I will do my best to reply as promptly as I can; however, please keep in mind that I may not always find sufficient time to give your email a same-day reply, especially later in the day, or on weekends. Emails will be monitored regularly; students will receive a response within up to 48 hours. Should a reply to a question require a meeting on Zoom, or the setting up of a phone appointment, students will be notified.</p><h4>Important Note on Plagiarism</h4><p>During subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, the issue of plagiarism has become increasingly pressing. Please understand the various forms that plagiarism may take and that it is a very serious academic offence. Furthermore, <strong>using ChatGPT or any other tools of AI while writing assignments/ take-home tests is strictly prohibited</strong>. Please note that the instructor <strong>may decide to hold oral tests to assess knowledge written about in the Midterm Test or Final Test.</strong> If a student does not demonstrate in extempore fashion clear knowledge of what they have written about in a test, the instructor <strong>may declare the Midterm Test or Final Test insufficient, and the student will FAIL the assignment in question</strong>.</p><p>According to the University's <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 - Student Discipline</a>, plagiarism is defined as "...the act of presenting the ideas, words, or other intellectual property of another as one's own. The use of other people's work must be properly acknowledged and referenced in all written material... Use of [source material] without complete and unambiguous acknowledgement...is an offence under this policy."</p><p>According to UWaterloo’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/"><u>Office of Academic Integrity</u></a>, here are some (though not all) of the types of plagiarism that constitute an academic offence:</p><ul><li>Word-for-word use of part or all of any written work (print or electronic) without quotation marks and/or without citation of the source (footnotes, endnotes, or parenthetic citations) and/or without a complete ‘works cited’ section.</li><li>Word-for-word use of text spans (phrases, sentences, paragraphs, longer segments) patched together from two or more sources without quotation marks and/or without citation of the source and/or without a complete 'works cited'.</li><li>Word-for-word use of primary source materials without quotation marks and/or without citation of the source and/or without a complete 'works cited'.</li><li>Word-for-word use of source materials with some text enclosed by quotation marks and provided with citations, but with other text not identified as quoted, and/or not cited, and/or without a complete 'works cited'.</li><li>Combination of word-for-word use of sources with close paraphrases of source texts, with accurate use of quotation marks and citations (note or parenthetic) to identify word-for-word use, but without citations to identify paraphrases and summaries, and/or without a complete ‘works cited’.</li><li>Completely paraphrased material without complete citations and/or without a complete ‘works cited’.</li><li>Giving a citation for only the first or last sentence in a paragraph, even though the rest of the paragraph also contains material in need of direct attribution.</li></ul><p><strong>In general:</strong> A complete and accurate 'works cited' page constitutes only one part of the fulfilment of the requirement for complete and unambiguous acknowledgement of sources. A very large proportion of plagiarized essays do have perfectly or nearly adequate 'works cited' pages. If the paper's reader has to go to (or hunt for), and has to look directly at, the text of the source in order to identify where the student's own thoughts and words end and the source's thoughts and words begin, then the paper is plagiarized.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or St. Jerome’s University. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p><strong>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. </strong></p><p>For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or St. Jerome’s University for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system. The faculty and staff in Arts encourage students to seek out mental health support if they are needed.</p><p><strong>On campus supports</strong></p><p>All of us need a support system.

Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details.
