<h2>
  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Understand basic properties of polymer molecules (both micro-structural properties, formed in the reactor, and final application properties), such as molecular weight averages, molecular weight distribution, average chain composition, copolymer composition distribution, average sequence length and distribution, crystallinity, glass transition temperature, etc. Students will be able to appreciate what makes polymer molecules unique (and so different from low molecular weight molecules) and hence so popular in nowadays applications (both commodity and specialty applications) (1, 2)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Be fluent with Polymer Reaction Engineering (PRE) tools (mathematical modelling and reaction engineering tools for understanding/designing/troubleshooting/optimizing polymerization reactors, and for controlling polymer product properties); optimization and control strategies in order to deliver desirable properties for final applications (3, 4, 5)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Differentiate between design scenarios vs data analysis (safety/toxicity/effects on the environment/consumer) (6, 7, 8, 9)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Understand basic polymer characterization or sensing techniques to monitor polymer properties; bridge between Polymer Science/Chemistry and Polymer Processing/ Modification/Rheology) (3, 4, 5, 9)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Understand basics of Polymerization Production processes and how they relate to product design and properties (multicomponent polymer products, branched vs linear vs crosslinked molecules; emulsion/suspension vs bulk/solution; chain growth vs step growth vs ionic/coordinated systems with a catalyst vs controlled free radical or other specialty cases, etc.) (3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12)</td>
</tr>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Lecture Schedule/Room: <u>first </u>lecture on Mon, Jan 6, 2025</strong></p><p><strong>See above under 'Class Schedule'</strong></p><p><u>Last lecture</u> on<strong> </strong>Wed, April 2, 2025</p><p><strong><u>Note:</u></strong> Winter Reading week/Study break: Feb 15-23, 2025; no lectures. </p><p><strong>Course Objectives</strong></p><p>This is a <u>quantitative course</u>. The course will discuss the role of Polymer Reaction Engineering (PRE) as part of modern Polymer Production Technology. <u>The emphasis</u> is on PRE and production technology (process/product) troubleshooting aspects. Interspersed in the course are aspects of polymeric material properties (both micro-structural and final application properties) and some related material from Polymer Characterization techniques. Hence, PRE is the bridge between Polymer Science/Chemistry and Polymer Processing/ Modification/Rheology. The idea is to become fluent with polymer reactor aspects and the basic tools of PRE from mathematical modelling in aid of polymerization process (and polymer product) understanding, operation troubleshooting and, finally, optimization/control. </p><p><strong>Very few undergrad (or grad) curricula cover this (internationally) from a Chemical Engineering perspective!</strong></p><p>Assignment and homework problems, along with examples in notes (and other practice exercises/questions given in class during lectures) are important to understand principles and techniques.</p><p>Interactions (via e-mail) between instructor/students are encouraged (for addressing quick/simple questions and for other clarifications); if a question is longer, then individual/ group meetings will be scheduled via e-mail; if you have questions, the time to ask them and clarify them is <strong>during the course</strong>, in advance, and not 5 minutes before the assignments (or other homework problems or project components) are due!</p><p><strong>Course Outline (tentative) (6 main chapters in course notes (more extensions depending on time and/or class appetite), covering the general themes that follow):</strong></p><p>CH 0:  Introduction (to polymerization and polymeric materials)</p><p>CH 1:  Basic Concepts/Definitions</p><p>CH 2:  General Introduction; Polymerization Process Information</p><p>CH 3:  Homogeneous Polymerizations-Chain Growth (contains 5 major parts)</p><p>CH 4:  Heterogeneous Polymerizations-Emulsion/Dispersion (contains 2 major parts)</p><p>CH 5:  Other Polymerization processes-Ionic</p><p>CH 6: Other Polymerization Processes-Coordination</p><p>Given the generalized development of the course material, applicable to different types of reactors and processes, CH 0 to 3 constitute the main course. CH 4-6 are more specialized topics. Some parts of posted notes may be reading material or special topics. The above chapters will be complemented by 11 Addenda files (with either additional practical hints and/or more information on polymer applications/uses); the topics above are the hard-core PRE topics; discussions on polymeric material properties (both micro-structural and final application properties) will be<strong> </strong>interspersed in all chapters.</p><p>CH 0 to 2 represent review/overview material, so they will be covered more quickly.</p><p>Course notes will be posted on LEARN before a specific chapter starts.</p><p><strong>Please check LEARN regularly for course related announcements/postings and information.</strong></p><p><strong>More specific details about all aspects of the whole course will be posted on LEARN in an 'Introduction/Outline/Admin Details' file, just as lectures start. Check especially under 'Course Delivery Specifics'.</strong></p><p><strong>Anything else?</strong> I am here to help you! <u>Talk to and clarify with me as soon as possible!</u> Ask questions before the due dates, not 5 minutes before the due date (or at mid-night)! Try to clarify your questions in a timely fashion! Do not delay and do not postpone! Now is the time!</p>
