<p><strong>Course Description</strong></p><p>Welcome to ChE640: Principles of Polymer Science. This course is designed to provide a practical foundation in polymer science. We will start with a general introduction to polymers and then learn about how to synthesize, characterize, design, and apply polymers. We will also emphasize the sustainability challenges associated with polymers and emerging strategies to deal with those challenges. Finally, we will discuss some of the emerging applications of polymer-based materials. This course will also emphasize the skills needed for a career in polymer science: critical analysis of the literature, research proposal development, and communication. Please see the learning outcomes below for more details.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Course Structure</strong></p><p>The course consists of three lecture hours each week split into two 90-minute sessions. Lecture slides for each week will be posted on Learn on the Sunday evening before class at the latest. Assigned readings for the literature discussions will be provided <i>at least</i> one week in advance. Thirty minutes of lecture time each week will be dedicated to discussing a research article from the literature. The grade evaluations in the course include lecture participation, midterm and final exams, and a research proposal project.</p>

<p><strong>Lecture Participation (10%)</strong></p><p>The lecture participation grade is split into two components: </p><ol><li><u>In class problem solving and concept check questions</u><i><u> (5%)</u> </i><ul><li>Vevox, a Q&amp;A and polling platform, will be used multiple choice for in-class problem solving and concept check questions. The questions will be designed to prepare you for the midterm and final exams.</li><li>One mark will be given for answering each question. A bonus mark will be given for providing the correct answer. Bonus marks from correct answers can be used to make up for points missed when absent from lectures.</li></ul></li><li><u>Literature discussion reflections </u><i><u>(5%)</u> </i><ul><li>Critical analysis of the literature is a key learning outcome of this course.</li><li>One research article will be assigned for each unit (see lecture schedule, there are 7 total literature discussions throughout the course).</li><li>We will have a 30min in class discussion on each article at the end of lecture on Thursdays.</li><li>To receive participation marks, in groups of 2-3, students will write me at least one sentence response to each of the following questions by the end of class on Thursday: <i>1. What was a strength of the study? 2. What was a weaknesses of the study? 3. What would you do next as a follow up to this study?</i></li><li>Each response will be worth one mark.</li><li>In the last two weeks of the course you will earn participation grades by asking at least two questions during student presentations.</li><li>At the end of the term, I will divide the literature discussion marks by 0.7. In other words, you only need to receive 70% of the marks to get full marks for literature discussion reflections.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Midterm Exam (20%)</strong></p><p>The midterm exam will be held in class on February 13th. The midterm exam will cover content taught in weeks 1-5. Questions will have a similar format to the in class example problems and concept check questions.</p><p><strong>Final Exam (30%)</strong></p><p>The final exam will be held during the final exam period. The final exam will be cumulative. Questions will have a similar format to the in-class example problems and concept check questions.</p><p><strong>Proposal Project (40%)</strong></p><p>Developing and proposing research ideas is one of the key skills you should gain as a graduate student. Through it this course you will learn how to critically analyze studies done by various research groups in polymer science. You will use those skills to propose your own research project. You will select a research group that works in polymer science and then develop proposal for a project you would work on during a two-year postdoctoral fellowship within that research group. The proposal will follow the format of an NSERC Postdoctoral Format (2 page written proposal, not including references). The project is divided into three parts:</p><ol><li><u>Outline </u><i><u>(5%, due on February 10)</u></i><ul><li>The outline will be maximum 1 page and will include:<ul><li>The name of the research group you selected.</li><li>The title of the proposal.</li><li>A 3-4 bullet point description the the motivation for the proposal.</li><li>The overall all objective of the proposal.</li><li>Two to three sub-objectives with a brief description of methods used in each.</li><li>A 1-3 bullet point description of the project's impact.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><u>Proposal </u><i><u>(25%, due on March 17)</u></i><ul><li>The proposal will follow the format of an<a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/onlineservices-servicesenligne/instructions/201/pgs-pdf_eng.asp#appinfo"> NSERC Postdoctoral Fellowship Proposal. </a>(scroll down to the heading "<i>Outline of Proposed Research</i>")</li><li>The proposal must be 2 pages, and figures are optional. The page limit does not include references.</li><li>More details on specific exceptions will follow.</li></ul></li><li><u>Pitch Presentation </u><i><u>(10%, presentations, presentations will take place from March 18th to April 3)</u></i><ul><li>You will do a 10-minute presentation to pitch your proposed research project, followed by up to 4 min of discussion.</li><li>More details on specific exceptions will follow.</li></ul></li></ol><p><u>Late Submission:</u> Late submissions for the outline and proposal will be accepted, but 10% will be deducted from the assignment's grade for each day late. Exceptions to this rule include AccessAbility accommodations, self-declared absences, and VIF.</p>

<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
