However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights and academic integrity.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.</p><p><strong>Continuity Plan - Fair Contingencies for Unforeseen Circumstances (e.g., resurgence of COVID-19): </strong>In the event of emergencies or highly unusual circumstances, the instructor will collaborate with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty. This may include modifying content delivery, course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines with due and fair notice to students. Substantial changes after the first week of classes require the approval of the Associate Dean, Undergraduate Studies.</p><p><strong>Declaring absences:</strong> [<i>undergraduate students and/or courses only</i>]  Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, students are responsible for reaching out to their instructors as soon as possible. The course instructor will determine how missed course components are accommodated. Self-declared absences (for COVID-19 and short-term absences up to 2 days) must be submitted through <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students"><u>Quest</u></a>. Absences requiring documentation (e.g., Verification of Illness Form, bereavement, etc.) are to be uploaded by completing the form on the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/"><u>VIF System</u></a>. The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services"><u>UWaterloo Verification of Illness form</u></a>, completed by a health professional, is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not send documentation to your advisor, course instructor, teaching assistant, or lab coordinator. Submission through the VIF System, once approved, will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Rescheduling Co-op Interviews: </strong>Follow the co-op process for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts"><u>rescheduling co-op interviews</u></a> for conflicts to graded assignments (e.g., midterms, tests, and final exams). Attendance at co-operative work-term employment interviews is not considered to be a valid reason to miss a test.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Recommendations for how to cite GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.
