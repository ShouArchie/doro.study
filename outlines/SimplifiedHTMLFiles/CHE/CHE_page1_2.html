<h4>Concept Checks<br/> </h4><p>Each week, excluding Midterm Week, a Concept Check question will be introduced in the first lecture session. These questions will cover material discussed during that lecture. Time will be allotted at the end of the same lecture period to complete the question and enter an answer on LEARN. No calculations or rough work will be submitted.<br/> </p><p>The lowest of the 11 Concept Check grades will be dropped and the total grade based on the remaining 10.</p><p> </p><h4>Tutorial Problems</h4><p><br/>Each week, excluding Midterm Week, a Tutorial Problem will be assigned at the beginning of the week. These Tutorial Problems will cover material discussed during that week's lectures, and will be slightly more complex than the basic Concept Checks. There will be dedicated time and TA support to solve these problems during each week's tutorial period.</p><p>The lowest of the 11 Tutorial Problem grades will be dropped and the total grade based on the remaining 10.</p><p> </p><h4>Discussion</h4><p><br/>To assist in clarifying and expanding upon topics discussed in class, students are expected to submit a Discussion post to a LEARN Dropbox at the end of each week.</p><p>The Discussion posts must include either of the following (but may include both, if desired):</p><ul><li>A question or request for clarification or expansion upon a topic covered during that module</li><li>Stop, Start, Continue (any or all of the following)<ul><li>What have we been doing in class that we might/should stop doing?</li><li>What have we not being doing in class that we might/should start doing?</li><li>What are we doing right, and should continue doing?</li></ul></li></ul><p>Discussion posts will be responded to individually by the instructor on LEARN. A portion of the next module’s first lecture will be dedicated to addressing the most common or urgent questions or feedback submitted in class. </p><p> </p><h4>Module Assignments<br/> </h4><p>There will be three Module Assignments which use several of the skills developed in their respective modules (1, 2, and 3-4) to solve a design problem. Each Assignment will include some open-ended aspects and involve some design decisions and rationale. Specific guidelines will be provided for the deliverables of each Assignment. </p><p> </p><h4>Midterm Test and Final Examination<br/> </h4><p>There will be one Midterm Test and one Final Examination administered during this course. The assessments are summative, meaning that they may assess students on all material covered until the date of the assessment. A 8.5 x 11" double-sided study sheet is permitted at both the Midterm Test and Final Examination. A summary booklet of required data and equations will be provided for both the Midterm Test and Final Exam, and released on LEARN prior to the test/exam dates. A portion of the final lecture prior to both the Test and Exam will be dedicated to review of material covered up to that point.</p><p>The Midterm Test will occur during Week 7 (Midterm Week, immediately following Reading Week).</p><p>The Final Examination will occur during the Final Examination Period at a date, time, and location to be specified by the Registrar’s Office.</p><p> </p><h4>Laboratory<br/> </h4><p>Laboratory assessments will be specified by the Laboratory Instructor during the first laboratory information session in Week 1.</p><p> </p><h4>Schedule of Lecture Assessments</h4><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Assessment</strong></td><td><strong>Due Date and Time</strong></td><td><strong>Submission Method</strong></td><td><strong>Individual or Group</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Concept Checks</td><td>1: Tuesday, January 7, 11:30 AM<br/>2: Monday, January 13, 3:30 PM<br/>3: Tuesday, January 21, 11:30 AM<br/>4: Tuesday, January 28, 11:30 AM<br/>5: Monday, February 3, 3:30 PM<br/>6: Tuesday, February 11, 11:30 AM<br/>7: Tuesday, March 4, 11:30 AM<br/>8: Tuesday, March 11, 11:30 AM<br/>9: Tuesday, March 18, 11:30 AM<br/>10: Tuesday, March 25, 11:30 AM<br/>11: Tuesday, April 4, 11:30 AM</td><td>LEARN Quiz (answer only)</td><td> Individual</td></tr><tr><td>Tutorial Problems</td><td><p>All due at 11:59 PM</p><p>1: Friday, January 10<br/>2: Friday, January 17<br/>3: Friday, January 24<br/>4: Friday, January 31<br/>5: Friday, February 7<br/>6: Friday, February 14<br/>7: Friday, March 7<br/>8: Friday, March 14<br/>9: Friday, March 21<br/>10: Friday, March 28<br/>11: Friday, April 4</p></td><td><p>As .pdf file</p><p>Written/scanned, written electronically, or typed</p><p>Crowdmark</p></td><td>Group (up to 2 members)</td></tr><tr><td>Discussion</td><td><p>All due at 11:59 PM</p><p>1: Sunday, January 12<br/>2: Sunday, January 19<br/>3: Sunday, January 26<br/>4: Sunday, February 2<br/>5: Sunday, February 9<br/>6: Wednesday, February 12<br/>7: Sunday, March 9<br/>8: Sunday, March 16<br/>9: Sunday, March 23<br/>10: Sunday, March 30<br/> </p></td><td><p>As text submission (no attached files)</p><p>LEARN Dropbox</p></td><td>Individual</td></tr><tr><td>Module Assignments</td><td>1: Friday, January 31, 11:59 PM<br/>2: Monday, February 24, 12:00 AM<br/>3: Friday, March 28, 11:59 PM</td><td><p>As .pdf file</p><p>Written electronically or typed</p><p>Crowdmark</p></td><td>Individual</td></tr><tr><td>Midterm Test</td><td><p>Thursday, February 27</p><p>12:30 - 2:20 PM</p></td><td><p>Written</p><p>In-person (graded on Crowdmark)</p></td><td>Individual</td></tr><tr><td>Final Examination</td><td>TBD</td><td><p>Written</p><p>In-person (graded on Crowdmark)</p></td><td>Individual</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p> </p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Delivery Mode<br/> </h4><p>Lectures will be delivered in-person, using "guided slides". Slides will be posted as .pdf files in advance of lectures; students are encouraged to bring hard copies or digital copies of the slides to lecture. During lecture, segments of slides, diagrams, examples, definitions, etc. will be discussed and filled in by the instructor. It is recommended that students follow along and complete their own copies of the slides for the week.</p><p>Any other materials needed for a lecture, such as reference materials, solved examples, videos, etc. will be posted or linked within the course content associated with the lecture's Module on LEARN. </p><p>Annotated slides (filled in with solutions, markup, etc.) will be posted at the end of each Module.<br/> </p><h4>Progression Policy</h4><p><br/>All 4 of the following criteria must be met to receive a passing grade in CHE101:</p><ol><li>Students must receive a passing total grade (50%/100%), as per Department policy.</li><li>Students must receive a passing grade (40%/80%) in the classroom (non-laboratory) component. Students who do not pass the classroom component will receive a course grade equal to their classroom component grade.</li><li>Students must receive a passing grade (10%/20%) in the laboratory component. Students who do not pass the laboratory component but do pass the classroom component will receive an <strong>INC</strong> in the course. Students who have already completed CHE101 with an <strong>INC </strong>grade due to failing the laboratory component may be considered for an exemption from the laboratory or classroom component upon repeating the course, at the instructor’s discretion.</li><li>Students must receive a passing grade (25%/50%) on the <strong>total</strong> of the Midterm Test (20%) and the Final Examination (30%). If a student does not meet this criterion, they will be assigned a course grade equal to the total of their Midterm Test and Final Examination grades.<br/><br/>Example 1: A student receives a course grade of 54.4%, meeting Criteria 1 and 3, with a lab grade of 16.2%/20% and a lecture grade of 38.2%/80%. This does not meet Criterion 2, and so the student will receive a course grade of 38.2/80 or 47.8%.<br/><br/>Example 2: A student receives a course grade of 54.4%, meeting Criteria 1 and 2, with a lab grade of 8.2%/20% and a lecture grade of 46.2%/80%. This does not meet Criterion 3, and so the student will receive a course grade of <strong>INC</strong>.<br/><br/>Example 3: A student receives 22/50 on the Midterm Test and 27/60 on Final Examination, but an overall grade in the course of 54.4%, with a lab grade of 12.2%/20% and a lecture grade of 42.2%/80% meeting Criteria 1, 2, and 3. However, their test grades correspond to 8.8%/20% and 13.5%/30% respectively, preventing the student from passing the course, according to Criterion 4. The student will be assigned a course grade of 8.8 + 13.5 = 22.3 out of 50, or 44.6%.<br/> </li></ol><h4>Missed or Late Assessments</h4><p><br/>Missed or late submissions of any assessment will be assigned a grade of 0. </p><p>Exceptions may only be made to this policy if:</p><ul><li>A student has an appropriate accommodation through the AccessAbility office allowing for an extension on assessments; usually this extension is 72 hours from the original due date. Extensions must be requested formally through the AccessAbility office, after which the instructor will contact the student directly with a revised due date and time.</li><li>A student has a verified illness and has submitted the appropriate Verified Illness Form (VIF). An extension, exemption, or make-up assessment details  will be made at the instructor's discretion and communicated directly to the student.</li><li>A student declares a Short-Term Absence. An extension, exemption, or make-up assessment details will be made at the instructor's discretion and communicated directly to the student. Short-Term Absences cannot be declared during the Final Examination period.</li></ul><p>If an exemption is made, the assessment will have no grade assigned. The instructor will communicate how the grade of the missed assessment will be distributed amongst the remaining assessments in the course.</p><p> </p><h4>First-Year Office<br/> </h4><p>The First-Year Engineering office is available to help with the transition to the university life and academics. They provide academic advisors, counsellors, and tutors to help with academic support, assessments, scheduling, etc. To connect with an advisor or find more information: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/undergraduate-students/first-year">https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/undergraduate-students/first-year</a>.</p><p> </p><h4>Faculty of Engineering Guiding Practices</h4><p> </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
