<p><strong>Problem Sets: </strong>There will be six problem sets during the course of this term designed to reinforce your understanding of the course material.  Problem sets will be graded based on the correctness and presentation of your solutions. You may work with your peers to complete the assignment; however, the final work you submit should be your own personal, hand-written solution. Assignments submitted after the due date will receive a grade of zero. To allow for a short-term absence during the term or other extenuating circumstances only the best 5 of 6 problem set grades will be included in your course grade. All assignments will be submitted and marked using CrowdMark. Tentative due dates for the problem sets are: <strong>Jan. 20, Feb. 3, Feb. 24, Mar. 10, Mar. 24 &amp; Apr. 4</strong>.</p><p><strong>Project:</strong> There will be a joint project for this course and CHE322. A separate handout with details about this project will be provided. The final project submission is due on <strong>Apr. 4</strong>.</p><p><strong>Quizzes:  </strong>In lieu of a midterm there will be five quizzes throughout this course. These quizzes are tentatively scheduled for <strong>Jan. 23, Feb. 6, Feb. 27, Mar. 13 &amp; Mar. 27</strong>. To allow for a short-term absence during the term or other extenuating circumstances the lowest quiz grade will be dropped. All quizzes will be closed book and closed notes. </p><p><strong>Final Exam:  </strong>The final exam will be scheduled by the registrar. You will be notified of the format of the exam on the last day of class.</p>
