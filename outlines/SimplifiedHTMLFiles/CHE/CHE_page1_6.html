Your answers to these questions will contribute to your lesson participation grade. Lesson participation grades for each lesson are evenly weighted in the total lesson participation grade. Lesson completion due dates are indicated on the course schedule above. You can view your lesson participation grades at any point in the Mobius gradebook and after the due date for each unit in the LEARN gradebook.</p><h4>Mobius Assignments</h4><p>Assignments are designed to reinforce course content. These assignments will be administered approximately biweekly using Mobius and can be accessed through LEARN.  The assignments are evenly weighted in the total assignment grade. You can view your assignment grades in the LEARN gradebook and Mobius gradebook. Assignment due dates are indicated on the course schedule above.</p><h4>Correct and Continue Assignments</h4><p>After completing Unit 1 - 5, and the associated assignment, you will be asked to dig a little deeper. You will receive a single, multi-part assignment question that has been started for you. However, there will be some errors in the provided solution. Your job is to identify the issues with the partial solution, correct them, and then finish the rest of the question. These assignments will be submitted through Crowdmark.</p><h4>Late Assignments</h4><p>No late submissions will be accepted. If you are unable to complete work due to illness or other extenuating circumstances the weight will be shifted to the remaining grade items in that category.</p><p> </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
