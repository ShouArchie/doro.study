<p>The weight of the laboratory is 20 % of ChE 101.  A minimum 50 % overall mark in the laboratory <u>is required for</u> ChE 101. </p><h4>Lab Safety Orientation and Quiz</h4><p>Students are responsible for completing the lab safety worksheet individually  and submitting to dropbox.  Submitting the safety orientation form is a pre-requisite to receive the safety quiz mark. The safety quiz is available on UW-LEARN and must be completed by your first scheduled lab session.</p><h4>Teamwork Module</h4><p>Students are responsible for completing the online teamwork module posted on LEARN, submitting the pre-class activity (individual), and participating in the in-class activity with your lab group.  </p><h4>Lab Attendance and Performance</h4><p>Students are responsible for attending the laboratory period and reading announcements made on UW-Learn. Students must act professionally in the laboratory period, be aware of the safety for each experiment and hazards in the laboratory, and wear proper protective equipment in the laboratory.  Lab Performance is assessed individually and details for assessment are in the lab manual posted on UW-Learn.</p><h4>Lab Quizzes (4 quizzes in total)</h4><p>The lab quiz for the lab you are performing <strong>must be completed by 11:59 PM the day of your scheduled lab</strong>.  Review the lab manual, virtual lab (Lab 3 and Lab 4), lab procedure, chemical safety data sheets (SDS) for the lab, and general lab safety information.  See the links on UW-Learn. There is no time limit on the quiz. <strong>Failure to submit the quiz on time includes a deduction of lab performance marks.</strong></p><h4>Lab Report</h4><p>The lab reports are due two weeks from the experiment date (by 11:59 PM on the due date) and must be submitted electronically to the proper folder on UW-Learn. Exceptions to the two week lab report due date are noted on the lab schedule or on UW-Learn. Refer to the lab report requirement in the lab manual, marking scheme posted on UW-Learn, presentation on report writing and error analysis and example report template on UW-Learn for guidance. </p><p><strong>Group Laboratory Report</strong></p><p>Students will submit two group laboratory reports on UW-Learn.  Marked reports will be distributed in UW-Learn. Report requirements are in the lab manual and marking scheme on UW-Learn.</p><p><strong>Individual Laboratory Report</strong></p><p>Students will submit two individual laboratory reports on UW-Learn.  Marked reports will be distributed in UW-Learn. Report requirements are in the lab manual and marking scheme on UW-Learn.</p><p><strong>Full Laboratory Report</strong></p><p>Requirements for a Full Laboratory report are in the lab manual and marking scheme on UW-Learn.</p><p><strong>Partial Laboratory Report</strong></p><p>Requirements for a Partial Laboratory report are in the lab manual and marking scheme on UW-Learn.</p><h2>Other Course Notes</h2><h4>Late Work </h4><p>Extensions are available for lab reports <strong>upon request to the course instructor (</strong><a href="cheryl.newton@uwaterloo.ca"><strong>cheryl.newton@uwaterloo.ca</strong></a><strong>) before the report due date</strong>. Available no penalty extensions are two business days. Late penalty is 10 % a week (2 % each business day).<strong> </strong>Weekends, reading days, midterm week, and holidays do not accumulate late penalties. For example, if you miss the an extended deadline of Friday and hand in before Monday at 11:59 PM it is a 2 % deduction. All late penalties are at the discretion of the course instructor. Dropboxes do not close past the due date and close the last scheduled day of classes.  Late work is not accepted to after the last day of classes without instructor permission.</p><h4>Regrading</h4><p>A request for lab report regrading must be received by the TA or instructor <strong>no more than 3 days after the grade was issued</strong>.  Please speak to the TA first regarding grade clarification. All regrading requests are at the discretion of the course instructor.</p><h4>A note about group work</h4><p>Unacceptable collaboration includes not completing the data analysis for your individual report and any word for word or figure/graph duplication of material from another report, lab manual, or any other reference<strong>. Word for word duplication in your lab report is flagged by Turnitin® and investigated by the course instructor.</strong> Use your own data for your analysis and always complete your own calculations for the individual report.  It is expected that group reports are worked on collaboratively and as a result all group members are responsible for the material in the report.  For example, if one group member commits an academic misconduct offence in part of the report they prepared all the group members are also responsible for the academic offence. </p><p>Individual lab quizzes are completed by accessing course content available on UW-Learn and information from the safety orientation.  Collaboration on the lab quizzes is acceptable with classmates, TAs and the course instructor.</p><p>Examples of student academic misconduct include:</p><ul><li>Obtaining, distributing, or receiving unauthorized academic material without the express consent of the course instructor.  Unauthorized materials include lab manuals, quizzes and other course material available in-class and on UW-Learn.</li><li>Sharing unauthorized course-related materials via hard-copy, email, social media or UW-Learn.</li><li>Using laboratory data, calculation workbooks, lab reports from other groups or students.</li><li>Using images or schematics from another source without proper referencing.</li><li>Not preventing your work from being used by others (facilitating plagiarism)</li></ul><h2>Attendance Policy</h2><p>Lab attendance in the lab session is required of all students in each group. If there is a reason you cannot make it to the lab session (for example illness, co-op interview, self-declared absence), you must contact the course instructor prior to the lab period so that an alternative arrangement may be made.  Any missed labs due to Quest self-declaration will need to be made up in the next lab session if available or at an agreed upon time with the course instructor.  <strong>Lab attendance is a prerequisite to lab report. If you do not attend the laboratory session you will receive zero on the corresponding lab report.</strong></p><h2>Generative AI</h2><ul><li>The laboratory course permits the use of generative AI (GenAI) such as ChatGPT, MS CoPilot, GitHub Copilot, etc. as a tool to enhance laboratory learning, particularly in report writing, Python programming.</li><li>Lab submissions, whether aided with GenAI or not, will be strictly assessed based on the relevance of the contents, required deliverables, and lab report format stipulated in the lab manual and marking rubric.</li><li>The use of GenAI needs to be acknowledged in terms of where and how the GenAI is used as a learning tool in the lab submissions.</li></ul><p> </p>

Substantial changes after the first week of classes require the approval of the Associate Dean, Undergraduate Studies.</p><p><strong>Declaring absences:</strong> [<i>undergraduate students and/or courses only</i>]  Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, students are responsible for reaching out to their instructors as soon as possible. The course instructor will determine how missed course components are accommodated. Self-declared absences (for COVID-19 and short-term absences up to 2 days) must be submitted through <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students"><u>Quest</u></a>. Absences requiring documentation (e.g., Verification of Illness Form, bereavement, etc.) are to be uploaded by completing the form on the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/"><u>VIF System</u></a>. The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services"><u>UWaterloo Verification of Illness form</u></a>, completed by a health professional, is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not send documentation to your advisor, course instructor, teaching assistant, or lab coordinator. Submission through the VIF System, once approved, will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Rescheduling Co-op Interviews: </strong>Follow the co-op process for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts"><u>rescheduling co-op interviews</u></a> for conflicts to graded assignments (e.g., midterms, tests, and final exams). Attendance at co-operative work-term employment interviews is not considered to be a valid reason to miss a test.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
