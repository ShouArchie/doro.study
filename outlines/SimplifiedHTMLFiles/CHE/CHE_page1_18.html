<p>Dropboxes for group and individual submissions are available on LEARN.   </p><p><strong>* GROUP REPORT RESPONSIBILITIES and MARKS ARE SHARED BY ALL MEMBERS.  </strong>Group-based marks will be adjusted based on 2nd Reflection Exercise responses, if applicable.  <strong> </strong></p><p><strong>TEAM REFLECTION EXERCISES (worth 1%):  </strong>Upon submission of group reports, you will be granted access to a post-group submission reflection exercise in LEARN quizzes.  If you are experiencing problems with the distribution of workload between group members, please contact the lab instructor about your concerns as soon as possible --- do not wait.  Your instructor will arrange to meet with any group that indicated problems to discuss potential remedies. If problems have not been resolved within the group by end of term, a distribution of effort evaluation may be used to adjust the portion of each member group report mark to reflect their effort. Please note that no member of the group will receive greater than the original group mark awarded.  <strong>For mark adjustments, uncompleted evaluations will be assumed to mean that effort by all members was balanced/no concerns exist.</strong></p><p><strong>PRELAB 1-4 QUIZZES (worth 1% per lab):  </strong>Each member of a group should complete and submit the online quiz on LEARN prior to lab session.  Must achieve min. 70% on quiz.  Multiple attempts are permitted.  Full mark earned for completion of quiz <strong><u>before start of scheduled lab session, otherwise zero points</u></strong>. Prelab quizzes can be accessed from LEARN Submit tab.  </p><p><strong>LAB PERFORMANCE (worth 1% per lab):  </strong>Your TAs will be assessing each member’s participation during lab sessions. Performance Mark criteria are posted on LEARN and include: </p><ul><li><strong>GENERAL CONDUCT: </strong><i>on-time, focus, professional behaviour, interest, use of time. </i></li><li><strong>PREPAREDNESS: </strong><i>familiarity with equipment, procedure, theory, calculations, and expected observations. Blank datasheet prepared in advance. </i></li><li><strong>ATTENTION TO SAFETY PROTOCOL: </strong><i>you must wear <strong>eye protection, lab coat </strong>and <strong>closed-toe shoes </strong>during lab sessions. Please review Lab Safety Rules in lab manual. </i></li><li><strong>TEAMWORK DURING LAB SESSION: </strong><i>coordination of duties, sharing info/ideas, etc. </i></li><li><strong>SAFETY ASSESSMENT: </strong>TA poses questions to <strong>each member </strong>asking for:<ul><li>a brief overview of the purpose or theory of the experiment,</li><li>specifications about function/theory of equipment or procedures,</li><li>potential hazards in procedure to be highlighted (<i>e.g. </i>electrical shock, exposures, pressurized systems, <i>etc.</i>) and steps to be taken to circumvent such hazards,</li></ul></li><li>Get started on your own. Work independently during labs.  Ask for clarification of procedures or calculations as needed.</li></ul><p><strong>In-LAB COMPONENT (worth 0.5% per lab):</strong></p><ul><li>Use the time between measurements to plot observed data and begin calculations.
