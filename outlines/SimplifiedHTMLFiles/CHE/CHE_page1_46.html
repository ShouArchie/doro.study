This problem will be briefly discussed in class and will be due one week after it is assigned.</p><h4>Design Projects</h4><p><br/>Design Projects comprise a summary report of a process, product, or facility that students will design based on the previous Module. Design Project 2 will also incorporate an in-class presentation (<strong>Pitch Meeting</strong>) in the form of a business pitch meeting for the designed facility, with an opportunity for instructors and colleagues to ask questions to the group. Each project will require submission of a report containing sections specified by an appropriate rubric. In the case of Design Project 2, each group member will be responsible for specific sections of the report and presentation as specified in its rubric, and will be graded individually on those sections.</p><p>Detailed calculations, simulation, modeling, etc. may be submitted as un-graded appendices to each project.<br/> </p><h4>Case Study</h4><p><br/>The Case Study involves the examination of an operating process and its contextualization within the broader socioeconomic environment. A specific series of questions regarding this process will be provided for students to answer. A summary document of these answers will be submitted.</p><p>Detailed calculations, simulation, modeling, etc. may be submitted as un-graded appendices to the Case Study.<br/> </p><h4>Debate</h4><p><br/>During Week 9, the lecture periods will be used to host a debate on a module topic. In groups of 3, students will present their case for or against a particular resolution assigned to their group, with 4 groups participating in debate on each day. Performance in the debate will be assessed via a detailed rubric distributed prior to the debate, and graded both by the instructor and by student peers.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Delivery Mode<br/> </h4><p>Lectures will be delivered in-person, using "guided slides". Slides will be posted as .pdf files in advance of lectures; students are encouraged to bring hard copies or digital copies of the slides to lecture. During lecture, segments of slides, diagrams, examples, definitions, etc. will be discussed and filled in by the instructor. It is recommended that students follow along and complete their own copies of the slides for the week.</p><p>Any other materials needed for a lecture, such as reference materials, solved examples, videos, etc. will be posted or linked within the course content associated with the lecture's Module on LEARN. <br/> </p><h4>Progression Policy</h4><p><br/>Both of the following criteria must be met to receive a passing grade in CHE516:</p><ol><li>Students must receive a passing total grade (50%/100%), as per Department policy.</li><li>Students must receive a passing grade (30%/60%) on the total of the Design Projects/Pitch Meeting. Students who do not meet this criterion will receive a final grade equal to their total grade on the Design Projects.<br/><br/>Example: A student receives 80/100 on the Biweekly Problems, 20/60 on Design Project 1, 25/45 on the Case Study, 32/45 on the Debate, 36/75 on Design Project 2, and 27/45 on the Pitch Meeting. This represents a grade of 54.7% per the Subject Outline, and meets Criterion 1 above.<br/><br/>However, the total of the Design Projects/Pitch Meeting is 83/180 or 27.7%/60%. Since this total is not greater than or equal to 30%, Criterion 2 is not met. The student will be assigned a grade of 83/180 or 46.1% in the course.<br/> </li></ol><h4>Missed or Late Assessments</h4><p><br/>Missed or late submissions of any assessment will be assigned a grade of 0. Missed presentations or debates will also result in a grade of 0 for the group member who missed the presentation or debate; other group members will not be penalized. Missing sections from the Design Project 2 report will only affect the grade of the group member who was responsible for them.</p><p>Exceptions may only be made to this policy if:</p><ul><li>A student has an appropriate accommodation through the AccessAbility office allowing for an extension on assessments; usually this extension is 72 hours from the original due date. Extensions must be requested formally through the AccessAbility office, after which the instructor will contact the student directly with a revised due date and time.</li><li>A student has a verified illness and has submitted the appropriate Verified Illness Form (VIF). An extension, exemption, or make-up assessment details  will be made at the instructor's discretion and communicated directly to the student.</li><li>A student declares a Short-Term Absence. An extension, exemption, or make-up assessment details will be made at the instructor's discretion and communicated directly to the student. Short-Term Absences cannot be declared during the Final Examination period. <br/><br/>A missed presentation or debate will not have a make-up or extension option and may only be exempted.</li></ul><p>If an exemption is made, the assessment will have no grade assigned. The instructor will communicate how the grade of the missed assessment will be distributed amongst the remaining assessments in the course.</p><p> </p><h4>Faculty of Engineering Guiding Practices</h4><p> </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
