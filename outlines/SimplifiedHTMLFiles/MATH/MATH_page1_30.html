<p>What is calculus? In essence, it is the study of the infinite and the infinitesimal. The infinitely large and infinitely small. We will study these ideas as they relate to sequences and functions. Then, we will use the tools we discover to solve problems and expand our knowledge. The main focus of the course will be approximation, as we examine how to approximate solutions to difficult (or even impossible) to solve problems. The course can be broken down into three main parts. First, we will examine sequences and what it means for one to converge. Next, we will use our knowledge of sequences to discuss functions, including limits and derivatives. This will allow us to develop a powerful theorem, the Mean Value Theorem, and we will examine its many applications. </p>

<p><strong>PIAZZA/EMAIL</strong></p><p><a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/math137/home">Piazza</a> is an elegant way to organize various communications throughout the course. This includes certain announcements and questions that you may have. You should think of Piazza as the place to ask questions about math. If you have a question regarding any of the problems, content, or basically anything you think would help others then please post a public question on Piazza so that everyone can see the answer. You can make yourself anonymous on a post‐by‐post basis if you feel the need. Private questions are acceptable too just think about the nature of your question before deciding the visibility status. Note that Piazza supports LaTeX syntax for Math. There’s also a built‐in formula editor that ultimately pastes the LaTeX code. Click <a href="http://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf">here</a> for a good LaTeX primer.<br/><br/>For administrative questions (e.g. enrollment changes, technical problems etc.) please use<strong> math137@uwaterloo.ca.</strong> You should think of this email address as the place to ask non‐math questions (including remark requests).</p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as writing clear and well-organized mathematical solutions and proofs. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. <strong><u>To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes.</u></strong> You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>
