<p>In this course, we will learn certain advanced topics in linear algebra. It turns out that the term “vector space” applies not only to the n-dimensional real vector space R<sup>n</sup>, but also to collections of m-by-n matrices with real coefficients M<sub>mxn</sub>(R) and polynomials of bounded degree P<sub>n</sub>R. We will see that such familiar terms as the dot product, norm, distance, orthogonality, and projection can be generalized in a natural way to these vector spaces. We will also extend the theory of matrix diagonalization to these new settings. The course will also touch upon some topics that find many real-world applications, such as the Method of Least Squares, Singular Value Decomposition and Linear Programming.</p>

  Administrative Policy

<div>
<h3><strong>Course Policies</strong></h3><h4>Calculators</h4><p>For the final exam, only calculators approved by the Faculty of Mathematics will be permitted. Please refer to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/calculator-regulation"><u>Calculator Regulation</u></a> to see a list of approved calculators.</p><p>If you are unable to acquire one of these calculators, you must contact your instructor in the first week or two of the course so an equivalent alternative can be identified and added to the exam proctors' list of permitted aids.</p><h4>Avoiding Academic Offences</h4><p>The Möbius Assignments, Written Assignments, and Final Examination are individual exercises. They must not be completed in pairs or groups. Other resources may be used to supplement the material in lessons, but looking up solutions to assignment questions is prohibited. You are capable of meeting the expectations for this course. If you are concerned about how well you are doing in this course, please contact your instructor for a discussion instead of considering academic misconduct.</p><h4>Course Conduct</h4><p>In this course, diverse perspectives are recognized and valued as a source of strength. Your instructor will work with you to create a class culture based on open communication, mutual respect, and inclusion. All discussions should be approached with respect and civility. Disagreements and debates in academic discourse are expected and welcome, but personal attacks are never OK, and will not be tolerated. Your instructor strives to ensure an open and welcoming classroom for all students.</p><h4>Caregiver Responsibilities Policy</h4><p>Some of you may be balancing your pursuit of education with the responsibilities of caring for children or other family members. If you run into challenges or if your caregiving responsibilities are interfering with your ability to engage in online learning, please contact your instructor.</p><h4>School-Life Conflict</h4><p>Many students face obstacles to their education as a result of work or family obligations or unforeseen personal difficulties. If you are experiencing challenges throughout the term that are impacting your ability to succeed in this course, or in your undergraduate career more broadly, please reach out to your instructor to work together to form a plan for your academic success. If you are unable to attend student drop-in hours, please email your instructor to set up a time that works for you or arrange a meeting.</p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
