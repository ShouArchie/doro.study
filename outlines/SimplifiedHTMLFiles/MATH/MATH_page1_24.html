<h3>Weekly Assessments</h3><p>Weekly Assessments includes quizzes and assignments. Refer to the course schedule on LEARN for specific dates.</p><p>The quizzes are designed to provide a simulated testing experience at a lower risk. Quizzes will take place during the tutorial time slot, with assigned rooms and seats indicated on Odyssey. Each quiz will last for 40 minutes, from 4:35 PM to 5:15 PM, so you must at the assigned room at 4:30 PM.</p><p>Assignments must be scanned and submitted electronically via Crowdmark. Detailed instructions are available on LEARN, and students must follow them carefully. While collaboration in understanding the material is encouraged, the work submitted must be your own, written independently. Do not seek out solutions from the Internet or printed sources. Refer to the Academic Integrity FAQ on LEARN for more details.</p><p><strong>Late Submission Policy:</strong><br/>Late submissions are accepted with a penalty of 1% per minute for the entire assignment, starting immediately after the deadline. For example, submitting 60 minutes late will result in a maximum possible score of 40%, assuming a perfect score. Only one submission is allowed after the deadline, and this is only possible if no submissions were made before the deadline. Ensure your submission is complete by uploading all files and clicking the "submit" button.</p><h3><strong>Midterm</strong></h3><p>The midterm exam will be held on Monday, February 10th, from 7 PM to 8:50 PM EST.</p><h3><strong>Final Exam</strong></h3><p>The final exam will be scheduled between Wednesday, April 9th, and Friday, April 25th. The exact date will be announced later.</p><h3><strong>Assessment Policies</strong></h3><p>All in-person assessments, including quizzes, the midterm, and the final exam, are closed-book. Calculators are not permitted during these assessments. Information on how to submit a regrade request is available on LEARN.</p><p>Our goal is to return grades and feedback within one week.</p><h4><strong>Accommodation Requests</strong></h4><p>All quizzes and assignments will count towards your final grade. However, if you are unable to complete an assessment due to circumstances beyond your control, such as health-related issues, you may be eligible for an exemption. </p><p>Please visit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations/submission">this link</a> for detailed information on how to request an accommodation. It is your responsibility to understand the requirements and limitations associated with each type of accommodation.</p><p>The first time an exemption is granted for a quiz or assignment, the weight of that component will be redistributed among the other weekly assessments. Should additional exemptions be granted, or if an exemption applies to the Midterm Exam, the weight of those components will be transferred to the Final Exam.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Submission of Medical Documentation:</strong> If you are forced to miss an assessment, e.g., due to illness or late enrollment, an accommodation may be provided to you. For more details, please review the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations/submission">Accommodations</a> page.</p><p><strong>Accommodations: </strong>If accommodation for a missed component is warranted, an exemption will be granted for this component.</p><p><strong>Personal and Mathematical Struggles: </strong>It is a common experience to have assignment questions that you cannot solve, to be disappointed by an assignment mark when you thought you had done the question perfectly, to struggle to balance the workload in your courses amidst everything happening in your life. You are not alone. Reach out to others in the course to form a study group. Don't be afraid to ask questions - probably others have the same question.</p><p>If you miss more than two assignments, or struggle to follow a few lectures, you may find it difficult to keep up with the course.

If you are unable to attend your instructor's office hours, please email to set up a time that works for you or arrange a meeting by Skype.</p><h4><strong>Generative AI</strong></h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as reading and writing proofs. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
