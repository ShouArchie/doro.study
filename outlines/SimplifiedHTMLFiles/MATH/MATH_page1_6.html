<h2><strong>Course Description</strong></h2><p>This course focuses on studying Euclidean space, also known as <strong>R</strong><sup>n</sup>. We will learn how to describe various objects such as vectors, lines, and planes in <strong>R</strong><sup>n</sup>. Next, we will focus on objects called matrices, which are often used to solve systems of linear equations. We will see how to solve systems of linear equations using matrix methods before studying matrices as algebraic objects in their own right. Next, we will learn about the fundamental concepts of span, linear independence, and basis and learn how to determine whether a set is a subspace of <strong>R</strong><sup>n</sup>. After studying subspaces, we will study linear mappings, which map subspaces to subspaces. We will discuss the geometric interpretation of these mappings and study their fundamental subspaces. Finally, we will learn how to calculate the determinant of a matrix and use this knowledge to diagonalize square matrices.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3><strong>Late Submission Policy</strong></h3><ul><li>Submission of Medical Documentation: If you become seriously ill and are forced to miss an assessment, an accommodation may be provided. For more details please review the Accommodation <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp">https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp. </a></li><li>Exceptions will only be made under unforeseeable and extraordinary circumstances. Evidence of such circumstances must be provided to the instructor in the form of supporting documentation from an appropriate source e.g., doctor’s certificate or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services"><u>Verification of Illness</u></a> form, copy of obituary, police report, etc.</li><li>Students with acceptable documentation must contact the instructor no later than 48 hours after a due date to make alternative arrangements. In special unforeseeable circumstances where due dates cannot be met, it is the student’s responsibility to provide acceptable written documentation substantiating the reasons for not meeting the deadline. When there are exceptional circumstances, there will be no penalty assigned; if no contact is made, a mark of “zero” will be given.</li></ul><h3><strong>Calculators</strong></h3><p>For the final exam, a scientific calculator is permitted.</p><h3><strong>Avoiding Academic Offences</strong></h3><p>The Möbius Assignments and Written Assignments are individual exercises. They must not be completed in pairs or groups.</p><p>Other resources may be used to supplement the material in lessons but looking up solutions to assignment questions is prohibited.</p><p><strong>You are capable of meeting my expectations for this course.</strong> If you are concerned about how well you are doing in this course, please come speak with me instead of considering academic misconduct.</p><h3><strong>Course Conduct</strong></h3><p>I am committed to creating a learning environment where diverse perspectives are recognized and valued as a source of strength. I request that all students work with me to create a class culture based on open communication, mutual respect, and inclusion. As a class we will approach all discussions with respect and civility. Disagreements and debates in academic discourse are expected and welcome, but personal attacks are never OK, and will not be tolerated. I strive to ensure an open and welcoming classroom for all students. If I ever miss the mark, please don’t hesitate to contact me. We are all learning together.</p><h3><strong>Caregiver Responsibilities Policy</strong></h3><p>I have great respect for students who are balancing their pursuit of education with the responsibilities of caring for children or other family members. If you run into challenges or if your caregiving responsibilities are interfering with your ability to engage in online learning, please contact me.</p><h3><strong>School-Life Conflict</strong></h3><p>Many students face obstacles to their education as a result of work or family obligations or unforeseen personal difficulties. If you are experiencing challenges throughout the term that are impacting your ability to succeed in this course, or in your undergraduate career more broadly, please reach out to me so that we can work together to form a plan for your academic success. If you are unable to attend my student drop-in hours (see more information on the Student Drop-In page in the Course Information on LEARN), please email to set up a time that works for you or arrange a meeting.</p><h3><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement</strong></h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p>
