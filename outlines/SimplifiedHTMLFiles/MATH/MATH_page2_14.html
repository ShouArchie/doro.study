<div>MATH 648:</div>
<p>This course explores the foundations of integral calculus and the use of series in approximating the basic functions of mathematics.  Topics include:  Understanding the Riemann Integral and its flaws, the idea of Lebesque, the geometric meaning of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, numerical integration, numerical series, uniform convergence of functions and the extraordinary nature of power series, Fourier Series.</p>

<p>This course will focus on the foundations of Integral Calculus and on the fundamental properties of both numerical series and power series.</p><p>The course begins with a brief review of the basics of the Riemann Integral. We then move on to give the formal definition of the integral and show that if a function f is continuous on [a, b] or if it is monotonic on [a, b], then the integral always exists. We then state and prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. This is one of the most celebrated results in all of mathematics. It provides the fundamental link between differential and integral calculus, hence its name.</p><p>The second chapter introduces Improper Integrals which will will need later in our study of series. This is followed by a short chapter on what should be familiar applications of integration. </p><p>Chapter 4 introduces the basics of differential equations. This may be new to many of you. </p><p>As a precursor to our in-depth look at  power series, in Chapter 5 we study in detail the properties of numerical series. Here the emphasis is on positive series. In addition to various integration a tests for determining convergence, we will look at some simple but effective techniques for analyzing series numerically.</p><p>Finally, in Chapter 6, we study the rather remarkable nature of power series and the functions they represent. Along the way we introduce the concept of uniform convergence and illustrate why this is preferable to the much simpler pointwise convergence. The course culminates with Taylor series, a topic which brings us back to where we finished off in MATH 647.</p><p>Throughout the course, I encourage you to use MAPLE or any other available software both a device for exploration and as a tool for numerical calculations.</p>

<div>
<h3>Course Policies</h3><p>Your assignments and quizzes must be uploaded by <strong>11:00 PM</strong> on the <strong>due date</strong> of the appropriate week (outlined in the Course Schedule). These days and times are those of the Eastern Time Zone. We cannot accept late submissions.</p><p>The assignments and quizzes are both individual exercises. They must not be completed in pairs or groups.</p><p>Other resources may be used to supplement the material in lecture modules, but looking up approaches or solutions to assignment questions is prohibited.</p><h3>Program Policies</h3><p>Students must maintain an overall average of 75% in the program, with individual course marks of at least 70%.</p><h3>Intellectual Property</h3><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience.  However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials.  However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.  The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Relevant University Policies:</strong></p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/node/97">Policy 71 – Student Discipline</a></p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/node/70">Policy 73 – Intellectual Property Rights</a></p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
