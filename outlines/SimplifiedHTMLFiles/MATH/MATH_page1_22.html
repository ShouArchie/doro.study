  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Submission of Medical Documentation:</strong> If you are forced to miss an assessment, e.g., due to illness or late enrollment, an accommodation may be provided to you. For more details, please review the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations">Accommodations</a> page.</p><p><strong>Accommodations: </strong>If accommodation for a missed component is warranted, the weight of the missed assessment will be shifted to the final exam.</p><p><strong>Personal and Mathematical Struggles: </strong>It is a common experience to have assignment questions that you cannot solve, to be disappointed by an assignment mark when you thought you had done the question perfectly, to struggle to balance the workload in your courses amidst everything happening in your life. You are not alone. Reach out to others in the course to form a study group. Don't be afraid to ask questions - probably others have the same question.</p><p>If you miss more than two assignments, or struggle to follow a few lectures, you may find it difficult to keep up with the course. While there are no alternate assignments, we recommend you check in with your instructor as soon as you can about how to keep up if you are falling behind.</p><p><strong>Math Assignment Planner:</strong>¬†We strongly encourage you to use <a href="https://lib.uwaterloo.ca/web/assignment-planner/math-assignment"><u>Math Assignment planner</u></a>, which provides students with step-by-step guidance for the completion of assignments. The math assignment planner will help you to:¬†</p><ul><li>Break down math assignments into manageable steps based on due dates</li><li>Allocate time appropriately towards the completion of the assignment which reduces the procrastination and cramming cycle</li><li>Incorporate time to get help on difficult questions which may reduce cheating/sourcing answers</li><li>Consider steps in completing assignments that they may not normally consider (i.e. taking time to understand the questions, taking time to review the material before attempting the questions, etc.)</li><li>Recognize the importance of taking time to consolidate understanding of the content</li><li>Appreciate the importance of reviewing marked assignments</li></ul><p><strong>Appeals:</strong> A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances (other than a petition) or Policy 71, Student Discipline may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to Policy 72, Student Appeals.</p><p><strong>Mental Health Support:</strong> The Faculty of Math encourages students to seek out mental health support if needed.</p><p>On-campus Resources:</p><ul><li>Campus Wellness¬†<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</u></a></li><li>Counselling Services:¬†<a href="mailto:counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca/"><u>counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca</u></a>¬†519-888-4567 ext 32655</li><li>MATES: one-to-one peer support program offered by Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) and Counselling Services: <a href="mailto:mates@wusa.ca"><u>mates@wusa.ca</u></a></li><li>Health Services: located across the creek from the Student Life Centre,¬†519-888-4096.</li></ul><p>Off-campus Resources:¬†</p><ul><li>Good2Talk (24/7): Free confidential help line for post-secondary students.

Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In particular:</p><ul><li>We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternate/preferred name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the term so we may make appropriate changes to our records.</li><li>We will honour your religious holidays and celebrations. Please inform of us these at the start of the course.</li><li>We will follow AccessAbility Services guidelines and protocols on how to best support students with different learning needs.</li></ul><p><strong>School-Life Conflict:</strong> Many students face obstacles to their education as a result of work or family obligations or unforeseen personal difficulties. If you are experiencing challenges throughout the term that are impacting your ability to succeed in this course, or in your undergraduate career more broadly, please reach out to your instructor or your TA immediately so that we can work together to form a plan for your academic success. If you are unable to attend your instructor's office hours, please email to set up a time that works for you or arrange a meeting by Skype.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as¬†reading and writing proofs. Therefore, the use of¬†Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of¬†<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a>¬†(plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance).¬†Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author‚Äôs original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values¬†of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.).¬†</p><p>You should be prepared to show your¬†work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document.¬†If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.¬†</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee:¬†<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a>¬†</p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:¬†</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a>¬†for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a>¬†for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a>¬†for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a>¬†for research-based assignments</li></ul><p>¬†</p>
