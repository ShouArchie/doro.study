  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>This course covers a selection of topics from multivariable vector calculus. In particular, we will aim to cover one item per week from the following list:</p><ol><li>A review of vectors and multivariable functions.</li><li>Geometry and particle motion in three dimensions.</li><li>Arc length and line integrals.</li><li>Quadric surfaces and coordinate systems.</li><li>Double and triple integrals.</li><li>Partial derivatives and linearizations in three dimensions.</li><li>Chain rule, directional derivatives, and gradients.</li><li>Vectors ﬁelds, divergence, and curl.</li><li>Path independence and Green’s theorem.</li><li>Surface integrals.</li><li>Divergence theorem and Stoke’s theorem.</li><li>Extrema of multivariable functions and Lagrange multipliers.</li></ol><p>These topics will be discussed in the context of real‐world applications in electromagnetism, gravity, and other areas of physics. A previous course in linear algebra is strongly recommended.</p>

<p>There is no required textbook. You will have access to the course content in Mobius as well as a PDF of the course notes posted to LEARN. I will also share short videos each week in which I work through examples and/or discuss particularly important concepts. I will also post problem sets with full solutions each week so that you have plenty of practice problems to work through. You will be expected to work through this material on your own to prepare for course assessments.</p><p>A textbook is not required but you may ﬁnd it helpful to have one on hand for extra practice. I recommend <i>"Essential Calculus"</i>, 2nd Edition by James Stewart which was prepared specifically for our course in a previous term. However, this textbook is difficult to come by now, so if you cannot find a copy of this book, then James Stewart’s full textbook (<i>"Calculus: Early Transcendentals"</i>) on calculus would also be a great resource since it is a superset of the recommended text.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You must earn a minimum grade of 50% on the final exam to pass the course. If you earn less than 50% on the final exam, then your grade in the course will be the lesser of your grade as determined by the grading scheme and 49%.</p><p><strong>Quizzes</strong></p><p>There will be weekly online quizzes consisting of problems similar to ones covered in the lessons/course notes and/or which have appeared on the Practice Problem Sets. These quizzes are in Mobius and can be accessed via Learn. You only have one attempt per quiz but there is no time limit, so you can open each quiz to view the questions, work on them at your leisure, and return to enter solutions anytime before the quiz due date.</p><p><strong>Assignments</strong></p><p>Assignments will be administered through Crowdmark approximately biweekly requiring clearly presented, full solutions to all questions unless specified in the question otherwise.</p><p><strong>Final Exam</strong></p><p>The ﬁnal exam will be scheduled by the registrar. Information on exams scheduled by the registrar can be found at https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/ﬁnal‐examinations/exam‐schedule.</p><p><strong>Discussion</strong></p><p>We will use Piazza (an online discussion forum) to engage with one another throughout the term. Putting a question that you have into words (and math) and/or explaining the solution to a problem are excellent ways to learn and Piazza is a place where you can do both of these things. I will also be active on Piazza marking answers as good, adding my own thoughts, and answering any questions that are going unanswered (or require prompt responses).</p><p>You can join our Piazza forum at</p><p><a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/math227">piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/math227</a></p><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  The instructor, teaching assistants, and markers will be routinely check for similarities between the work submitted by different students to screen for potential plagiarism or breaches of academic integrity. Websites that offer to complete students' homework for them will also be monitored. To be clear - such websites are not allowed to be used for the completion of any assessment in MATH 227.
</p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Missed Assessments</strong></p><p>If you miss or expect to miss an assessment, you must inform the instructor as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours after it takes place. In exceptional circumstances, the weight of a missed course component will be shifted to the final exam. In most cases, some form of documentation will be required and, for illnesses, a Verification of Illness Form must be submitted to the undergraduate office for your home faculty (e.g., the Science Undergraduate Office if you are a student in the Faculty of Science).</p><p>Requests to defer the final exam will only be considered in exceptional circumstances if appropriate documentation is provided and course progress suggests that a passing grade in the course would be expected.</p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
