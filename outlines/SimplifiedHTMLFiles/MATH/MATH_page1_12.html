<p><strong><u>Tutorial Assignments</u> - Distributed, submitted, and returned during weekly tutorials.</strong></p><p>Each tutorial will feature a graded problem set designed to get you thinking at a deeper level about the material. You may also see some new content that augments what was discussed in class. It is recommended that you prepare for the tutorials in advance by reviewing your notes from the previous week of class and attempting the practice problems posted on LEARN and in the textbook.</p><p>You may solve the problems in groups, or individually if you prefer. If working in a group, each group member must write and submit their own solutions in their own words. Exchanging ideas is encouraged, but the final submission must be your own work. You are permitted to use your personal notes, any resources on the MATH 119 LEARN page, and a scientific (non-graphing) calculator. No other resources are permitted. The Tutorial Assignments must be handed in by the end of the tutorial; no extension on submission is allowed. We will take the best 8 out of 10 assignments when computing your final grade. If a student misses a tutorial (due to illness, etc.), then that missed assignment will be counted as one of the dropped assignments. Students who miss more than 2 assignments will have the weight(s) of those assignments transferred to the final exam.</p><p><strong><u>Exams</u></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Midterm: </strong>In-person on Tuesday, February 25, 12:30-2:30 PM.</li><li>There will be no make-up midterm. Students who miss the midterm and provide proper documentation will have the weight of the midterm transferred to the final exam. Otherwise a grade of zero will be awarded to those who miss the midterm.<br/>Â </li><li><strong>Final Exam: </strong>In-person. Date TBD by the Registrar's Office during the period April 9 - 25.</li><li>Absence from the final exam may result in a grade of INC or DNW at the discretion of the instructor.</li></ul><p>Â </p>

  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>If directed by University policy, activities for this course may involve recording, in partial fulfillment of the course learning outcomes. You will receive notification of recording via at least one of the following mechanisms: within the Learning Management System (LEARN), a message from your course instructor, course syllabus/website, or other means. Some technologies may also provide a recording indicator. Images, audio, text/chat messaging that have been recorded may be used and/or made available by the University to staff and students of course MATH119 - Winter 2025 for the purpose of understanding material and allowing staff and students in other time zones to benefit from discussed information. Recordings will be managed according to the University records classification scheme, WatClass (https://uwaterloo.ca/records-management/records-classification-and-retentionschedules), and will be securely destroyed when no longer needed by the University. Your personal information is protected in accordance with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31) , as well as University policies and guidelines(https://uwaterloo.ca/privacy/) and may be subject to disclosure where required by law.</p><p>The University will use reasonable means to protect the security and confidentiality of the recorded information, but cannot provide a guarantee of such due to factors beyond the Universityâs control, such as recordings being forwarded, copied, intercepted, circulated, disclosed, or stored without the Universityâs knowledge or permission or the introduction of malware into computer system which could potentially damage or disrupt the computer, networks, and security settings.

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
