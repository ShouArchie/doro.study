  Instructor &amp; TA (Teaching Assistant) Information
</h2>
<div>
<p>The following conventions will be used throughout the term:</p><ol><li><strong>All times listed are in Eastern Time</strong> - the time of day in Waterloo, Ontario!<br/> </li><li><strong>All official announcements will be done through Learn.</strong> You should be checking Learn daily, for all of your courses!<br/> </li><li>Questions about course content (concepts, assignment questions, etc) should be asked on <a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/math235_081_cel_1251/home">Piazza</a>. If you have a question, it's quite possible another student has that same question as well!<br/> </li><li>Personal questions (discussing your performance in the course, regrading requests, need for accommodations, etc) should be done through email to me. Emails are easier for me to track later than <a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/math235_081_cel_1251/home">Piazza</a> posts!<br/> </li><li>It is important that your email is sent from your @uwaterloo.ca email address. <strong>External addresses will not be responded to.</strong><br/> </li><li>Office hours will be announced later. I also keep an active <a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/math235_081_cel_1251/home">Piazza</a> presence so I'll be able to answer your questions there!</li></ol><p>The Math Tutorial Center is also available for both in-person and on-line hours. See <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/tutoring-centre">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/tutoring-centre</a> </p><p>Although help for completing assignments is available (from instructors, tutors, or classmates), you should keep in mind that you will be on your own during the final exam. Therefore, when you seek help, the objective is not getting the problem/assignment completed - your objective should be learning and understanding the material as best possible.</p>

<h2>LECTURES AND COURSE CONTENT</h2><p>The intended mode of delivery for this course is <strong><u>asynchronous</u></strong>, which means course content (and most support) will not usually be done in a live setting. In Learn you'll find the <strong>Course Lecture Content</strong> folder, which contains the links to the content in Mobius for each week. You are strongly encouraged to work through the content and attempt the questions in the lessons until you understand them.</p><h2>Piazza / Email</h2><p>A <a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/math235_081_cel_1251">Piazza</a> page has been set up for our course this term. You may choose to post anonymously on Piazza - I will know who posted, but other students will not.</p><p>As well, please feel free to use this as a forum for discussion with other students. Regarding topics in the course, I will be sure to signal which responses are correct and correct those which need modification.</p><p><strong>Do NOT publicly post your written solutions on Piazza, nor answer Assignment questions in full. Doing so may be considered a violation of Academic Integrity policies and may result in the appropriate penalties.</strong></p><p>A full list of <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/le/content/1093587/viewContent/5752712/View"><u>rules/guidelines for Piazza</u></a> have been posted on Learn.</p>

<h3>Mobius and Written Assignments</h3><p>Each week you will receive one Mobius assignment on Wednesday mornings. These will be due on Tuesdays at 5pm, beginning on January 14. So there will be 12 Mobius Assignments in total. The lowest grade from your Mobius Assignments will be dropped.</p><p>There will be 5 Written Assignments due on Tuesdays at 5pm of week 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. </p><p><strong><u>Mobius Assignments:</u></strong> You may attempt each Mobius assignment as many times as you like before the deadline and your highest grade will count. These are accessible from the Mobius Assignments folder on Learn. All Mobius Assignments are available at the start of the term, and practice versions of assignments that are past due will be made available.</p><p><strong><u>Written Assignments:</u></strong> These will be submitted on Crowdmark, and should consist of 5-6 questions per assignment. These will help you practice your ability to write proofs and check your understanding of the week's concepts. You may complete these in groups of up to 3 students. You do not need to be in a group, and you do not need to be in the same group for each assignment.  I will post a note to <a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/math235_081_cel_1251/home">Piazza</a> to help students form groups.</p><p>Remember: the assignments are here to help your learning, and are even more crucial in an asynchronous environment! You should be striving each week to understand the material on the assignments and the posted solutions. You won't be in a group setting on the final exam, and it is worth most of your grade, so you will need to understand the material yourself in order to pass the course. This is not a course you can "cram" and survive - you must build the intuition for the material gradually throughout the term.</p><h3>Final Exam</h3><p>The Final Exam will be scheduled by the Registrars Office. Information will be provided on LEARN regarding locations for the exam. This will be a <strong>closed book exam, with no calculators permitted.</strong> It will be a cumulative exam, covering topics from the entire course.</p><h3>Passing the Course / Grade Calculation</h3><p>In order to pass the course, you must receive a grade of at least 45/100 on the Final Exam. Otherwise, the highest your final grade will be is 45.</p><p>If you pass the Final Exam, your minimum possible course grade will be 50%.</p><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong><u>Regrade Requests:</u> </strong>If you feel there has been an error in the marking of an assessment,<strong> you have one week from the time you receive your graded work</strong> to request a regrade.  Your regrade request should include the question(s) you would like regraded as well as a brief justification as to why you believe a regrade is necessary.  Regrade requests received after one week has elapsed will not be considered. Please note that if the mark assigned to the question you're asking about was too high, it may be adjusted to the lower, appropriate grade.</p><h2><strong>Mental Health Support</strong></h2><p>The Faculty of Math encourages students to seek out mental health support if needed.</p><p> On-campus Resources:</p><ul><li>Campus Wellness: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</a></li><li>Counselling Services: <a href="mailto:counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca/">counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca/</a> 519-888-4567 ext 32655</li><li>MATES: one-to-one peer support program offered by Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) and Counselling Services: <a href="mailto:mates@wusa.ca">mates@wusa.ca</a></li><li>Health Services: located across the creek from the Student Life Centre, 519-888-4096.</li></ul><p> Off-campus Resources:  </p><ul><li>Good2Talk (24/7): Free confidential help line for post-secondary students.

We recognize the immense value of the diversity in identities, perspectives, and contributions that students bring, and the benefit it has on our educational environment. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In particular: </p><ul><li>We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternate/preferred name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the term so we may make appropriate changes to our records.</li><li>We will honour your religious holidays and celebrations. Please inform of us these at the start of the course.</li><li>We will follow AccessAbility Services guidelines and protocols on how to best support students with different learning needs.</li></ul><h2>Generative AI</h2><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as writings proofs and communicating mathematical ideas. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
