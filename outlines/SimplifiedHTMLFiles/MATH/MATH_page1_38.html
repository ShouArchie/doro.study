<div>MATH 146:</div>
<p>MATH146 is an advanced-level version of MATH136.</p>

<p>This course is a rigorous treatment of the theory of finite dimensional vector spaces over an arbitrary field. We also cover the theory of determinants over an arbitrary commutative ring with identity, and some aspects of the theory of polynomials in one variable over a field. The ultimate goal is the Primary Decomposition Theorem, which characterizes a linear operator on a finite dimensional vector space in terms of invariant subspaces annihilated by the primary factors of its minimal polynomial.</p><p>The course prerequisite is Math 145 [Algebra (Advanced Level)]. This course is for Honours Mathematics students only. You are expected to have had some previous exposure to and be comfortable with rigourous mathematical proofs. We will cover a large amount of difficult material at a fast pace.</p>

<p>There is no required text for this course. Much (but not all) of my lectures will closely follow the first six chapters of this book:</p><ul><li>“Linear Algebra: Second Edition” by Kenneth Hoffman and Ray Kunze; Prentice Hall, 1971.</li></ul><p>This book is unfortunately out of print. Another useful text for this course is:</p><ul><li>“Linear Algebra: Fourth Edition” by Friedberg, Insel, and Spence; Prentice-Hall, 2003. (This text has been used for MATH 146 in recent years and many used copies should be readily available.)</li></ul><p>If you attend all the lectures (and you should) then you can get by without needing to purchase a textbook.</p>

<p>You may use calculators/computers to do the assignments, but you will not be permitted to use them for the midterm or the final exam. Please note that you are strongly encouraged to work together with your classmates on the assignment problems, but you must write up and turn in your own solutions to the problems. The assignments are an integral part of your evaluation in this course and I encourage everyone to take them very seriously. I will not be sympathetic to requests for leniency after the exam if you have not done the assignments. There will not be an opportunity to base your entire course mark on the final exam. This course will cover a large amount of difficult material at a fast pace. If you do not work hard in this course from day one, you will not do well.</p><p>There will be no opportunity for a make-up midterm test. A student who misses the midterm test without a valid, acceptable excuse (accompanied by documented proof, such as a medical note) will receive a score of zero on the test. Students who miss the midterm for valid reasons will have the 15 points missed transferred to the final exam.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Do not attempt to submit work that you have simply copied (or generated) from other sources. The TAs and I will be easily able to identify if you do not understand what you have written. It is not in your best interests.

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
