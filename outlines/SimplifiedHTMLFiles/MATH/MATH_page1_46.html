<p><strong>Tests and final exam</strong></p><ul><li><u>Dates</u>:  There are three 45-minute tests, held during tutorial slots as indicated in the Course Schedule above.  The 2.5-hour final exam will be centrally scheduled by the Registrar's Office.</li><li><u>Assigned seating</u> is used, with seating details available at <a href="https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/teaching/schedule">https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/teaching/schedule</a> about a week before each test or final exam.</li><li><u>Permitted aids</u>:  For each of the tests, you may use a non-programmable calculator.  For the final exam, you may use a non-programmable calculator and you may prepare and use one double-sided handwritten aid sheet (on normal 8.5 x 11 inch paper).  Full test and exam rules will be provided no later than one week before the test or exam dates.</li><li><u>Rule about collaboration</u>:  The tests and the final exam must be done individually.</li><li><u>Weightings of the tests</u>:  For each student, assuming all three tests are written, the lowest-score test will be dropped and each of the other two is worth 15%.</li><li><u>Missed tests</u>:  No make-up or alternatively-scheduled tests are being offered in this course.  The only reasons deemed valid for missing a test are severe illness (either self-declared covid-related or otherwise verified by a Verification of Illness form), or a self-declared short-term absence on Quest (one of the two days must overlap the test date), or other extreme circumstances approved by the course instructor.  A test that is missed without a valid reason counts as if the test was written with an earned grade of zero.  If one of the three tests is missed for a valid reason, the remaining two tests are each worth 15% of the final course grade.  If two tests are missed for valid reasons, the remaining test is worth 15% of the final course grade, and the weight of the final exam is increased to 60%. If all three tests are missed for valid reasons, the weight of the final exam is increased to 75%.</li></ul><p><strong>Assignments</strong></p><ul><li><u>General information</u>:  There are six assignments.  Each assignment involves completing and submitting exercises selected from those included at the end of each chapter in the course notes.  The instructor may also create additional exercises per assignment.</li><li><u>Format of submissions</u>:  Solutions should be neat, well organized, and well labelled.  They may be hand written or typed.  Only pdf files are accepted.</li><li><u>Submission location and date</u>:  Submit in the relevant LEARN dropbox by 11:59pm (Waterloo time).  Deadlines are included in the Course Schedule table above.</li><li><u>Late submission policy</u>:  Missing the deadline by up to 1 hour results in a grade reduction of 25% of the possible marks, while missing it by up to 24 hours results in a grade reduction of 50% of the possible marks, and beyond that the grade reduction is 100%.  Late penalties may be waived at the course instructor's discretion, but only in cases of severe illness (either self-declared covid related or otherwise verified by a Verification of Illness form), or if a student submits a self-declared short-term absence on Quest (one of the two days must overlap the deadline), or in other extreme extenuating circumstances approved by the course instructor.  In no case will an assignment submission be accepted more than three days after the due date.</li><li><u>Assignment grading</u>:   Grading will factor in completeness, neatness, and organization.  Due to limited TA resources, only a small subset of exercises will be graded in detail for correctness.</li><li><u>Weights of assignments</u>:  The lowest-scored assignment will be dropped for each student.  The remaining five assignments are equally weighted (i.e., each of those five is worth 5% of the final course grade).</li><li><u>Allowable collaboration/aids:</u><ul><li>You may collaborate with other students in the current MATH213 class, but you must individually write up and submit your own solutions.</li><li>For the most part, calculations should be done manually with the help of a basic calculator.  However, you may use Matlab (or equivalent computational software) where indicated in the exercise questions or to double-check answers or to do routine calculations such as factoring polynomials.</li><li>You may not post assignment questions or answers on any social media or website.</li><li>You may not use “homework services” such as chegg.com or coursehero.com.</li><li>You may not use AI/ML software such as ChatGPT to help with the assignments.</li></ul></li></ul><p> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
