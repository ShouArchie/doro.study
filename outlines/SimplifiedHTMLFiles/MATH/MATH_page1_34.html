<p>The goal of this course is to further expand your knowledge of calculus and its applications for one-variable functions. The course can broadly be split into three parts. First, we will explore areas under curves and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, integration techniques, and applications of integration including finding the area between two curves, volumes of solids of revolution, and the average value of a function. Secondly, we will examine differential equations. We will study how to solve separable differential equations and linear differential equations as well as their applications to population growth and Newton's Law of Cooling. Finally, we investigate infinite series. Various tests of convergence will be introduced for series of numbers. Then, we study power series with a focus on Taylor series and look at their applications. </p><p><strong>Note on physics-based section 010:</strong> The fundamental ideas of calculus were developed in an effort to understand natural phenomena, including gravitation, mechanics, fluid flow, heat transfer, etc. We will use this connection to physics to motivate and apply the calculus concepts discussed in this course.</p>

<p><strong>PIAZZA/EMAIL</strong></p><p><a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/math138">Piazza</a> is an elegant way to organize various communications throughout the course. This includes certain announcements and questions that you may have. You should think of Piazza as the place to ask questions about math. If you have a concern about the practice problems or quizzes, or basically anything you think would help others then please post a public question on Piazza so that everyone can see the answer. You can make yourself anonymous on a post‐by‐post basis if you feel the need. Private questions are ok too just think about the nature of your question before deciding the visibility status. Note that Piazza supports LaTeX syntax for Math. There’s also a built‐in formula editor that ultimately pastes the LaTeX code. Click <a href="http://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf">here</a> for a good LaTeX primer.<br/><br/>For administrative questions (e.g. exemption requests due to illness, enrollment changes, technical problems, etc.) please use <strong>math138@uwaterloo.ca</strong>. You should think of this email address as the place to ask non‐math questions (including re-mark requests).</p>

<h2><strong>Quizzes (20%)</strong></h2><p>Quizzes will be written during your tutorial timeslot on <strong>Wednesdays </strong>from <strong>5:30 - 6:20 PM. </strong>You will have an <strong>assigned </strong>seat each week and you <strong>MUST </strong>write your quiz in that assigned seat. The seating will be available a few days before each quiz on Odyssey. </p><p>Quizzes will be <strong>closed book </strong>with <strong>no aids allowed </strong>and you will have <strong>35 minutes</strong> to complete each quiz.</p><p>Missed quizzes will be given a mark of zero unless valid documentation is provided (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations</a>).</p><p>To help you prepare for the quizzes, practice problem sets and practice quizzes will be posted on LEARN 1-2 weeks before the quiz. There will be at least one similar (or even identical) problem that is common to both the practice problem sets and the quiz you will be writing!<br/> </p><h2><strong>Midterm (30%) and Final Exam (50%)</strong></h2><p>The midterm is currently scheduled for<strong> Monday, February 24th, 7:00 pm - 8:50 pm.</strong> If you are unable to write the midterm (for example, you are sick) then valid documentation (such as a University of Waterloo Verification of Illness form) should be submitted to the Math Undergraduate Office (MC 4022, mathuo@uwaterloo.ca) and to your instructor, following the instructions here: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations</a>. In this case, the weight of the midterm will shift to your final exam. That is, if you are exempted from the midterm, your final will be worth 80%. <strong>There will be NO make-up midterm.</strong><br/><br/>The final exam will be scheduled by the registrar's office. Details will be posted on LEARN. If you miss the final exam, you must have a valid reason and provide appropriate supporting documentation to the Math Undergraduate Oﬃce (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations</a>). Absence from the ﬁnal exam may result in a grade of INC or DNW at the discretion of the instructional team. To be considered for an INC, you must have a passing grade on the midterm test and an overall average of at least 50% on the quizzes. (See <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/incomplete-procedure">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/incomplete-procedure</a>.)<br/> </p><p> </p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
