<p>The purpose of this course is to introduce students in physics, chemistry, and other fields to differential equations. Differential equations capture how some variable of interest, such as the position of a planet, changes as a function of some independent variable, such as time. Differential equations are very widely used in the sciences because of the broad range of real-world phenomena they can describe in a mathematical framework. Therefore, a basic familiarity with how to characterize them, how to solve them, and how they behave is very valuable. In this course, students will be introduced to the universe of differential equations, including first-order equations, second-order linear equations, series solutions, the Laplace transform method, and both exact and numerical methods for solving differential equations. Applications in physics and chemistry will be emphasized.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You must achieve at least 50% on the final examination to pass the course. If the student fails the final exam (mark of 49% or lower), their course mark is the lower of (1) their course average computed using the grade breakdown, or (2) 49%, if their course average is 50% or higher.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  The instructor and teaching assistant will be routinely checking for similarities between the work submitted by different students to screen for potential plagiarism or breaches of academic integrity. Websites that offer to complete students' homework for them will also be monitored. To be clear - such websites are not allowed to be used for the completion of any assessment in MATH 228.

<div>
<h3>Course Policies</h3><h4>Missed Assignments or Quizzes</h4><p>Late assignments or quizzes will not be accepted and will receive a mark of zero.</p><p>If assignments or quizzes are missed due to medical reasons, students must provide documentation verifying the events that have precluded them from meeting their academic deadlines.</p><p>Contact the instructor as soon as you realize there will be a problem, and preferably within 48 hours, but no more than 72 hours, have a medical practitioner complete a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/students/health-and-well-being/primary-care-appointments/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-vif-services">Verification of Illness Form</a>. <strong>Email</strong> a scanned copy of the Verification of Illness Form to your instructor.</p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
