<div>
<div>
<div>MATH 103:</div>
<p>An introduction to applications of algebra to business, the behavioural sciences, and the social sciences. Topics will be chosen from linear equations, systems of linear equations, linear inequalities, functions, set theory, permutations and combinations, binomial theorem, probability theory.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>The course begins with a review of operations with real numbers and fundamental algebra skills. The solutions of polynomial equations, both linear and quadratic, in one and two variables and their graphical representation are studied. An extension is made to linear systems with their solutions being expressed both algebraically and graphically. To solve linear systems, matrices and the associated row reduction strategies are used. The interpretation of an equation or system of equations in various applications will be studied.</p><p>The relationship between exponential functions and logarithmic functions is examined. The basic properties of logarithms are introduced and used to solve logarithmic and exponential equations. Various applications involving exponential growth and decay and logarithmic scales are presented.</p><p>Probability theory is the primary focus of the final three units. Concepts in set theory and counting theory support the study of probability theory. </p><figure><img src="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/content/enforced/669401-MASTERMATH103Online/media/images/infographic-0.svg?_&amp;d2lSessionVal=gspWfkDjApSDFKRDEEXlfVirX&amp;ou=669401"/></figure><p>khvost/iStock/Getty Images</p>

<p><strong>Möbius Assignments</strong> are designed to test your initial understanding of the course content. It is recommended you complete them as soon as possible after completing the associated lessons.  No late submissions of Möbius Assignments will be accepted.<br/><br/><strong>Written Assignments</strong> provide a valuable opportunity for feedback on your written work. Consistent, appropriate work on assignments is highly correlated with success in the course.  You are able to ask questions of your instructor and discuss the questions with other students in the course, but the solutions that you submit must be your own work and so should be written up without any consultation with your colleagues and should include the names of any students you discussed problems with.  Written assignments received after the date and time listed in the <strong>Course Schedule</strong> in LEARN will be deducted 1% per minute that the assignment is late.  </p><p><strong>Unit Tests</strong> are to be solved independently.  You are not permitted to discuss the questions with others.  You are welcome to use any of the course materials (lecture notes, course notes, past assignments) as needed; however, it is recommended that you treat these unit tests as preparation for the final examination, and attempt to complete them with only the aids that are allowed for the final examination.   <strong>You will be given a time-limit of 3 hours to complete and submit your work. </strong>Unit Tests received after the date and time listed in the <strong>Course Schedule</strong> in LEARN or after the 3 hour time-limit will be deducted 1% per minute that the assessment is late.</p><p>The <strong>Final Examination</strong> will be scheduled by the Registrar's Office, and the details will be provided in the published <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/exam-schedule">Final examination schedule</a> when available.  The Final Examination is closed-book and will cover material from the entire course.  The only permitted aids for the final exam are: </p><ul><li>A double-sided "cheat sheet". The maximum paper size is 8.5" x 11" (A4). All content on your "cheat sheet" must be hand-written. At the end of the exam, your "cheat sheet" will be submitted to the proctors along with your final examination paper.</li><li>A non-programmable, non-graphing scientific calculator. Please refer to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/calculators">Calculator Regulation</a> page for recommended models available for purchase at the <a href="https://wstore.uwaterloo.ca/">W Store</a> or MathSoc (MC 3038).</li></ul><p><strong>Accommodations for missed assessments </strong>require proper documentation.  Please review the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Accommodation for illness or extenuating circumstances</a> page, which maintains current and clear information for students about the process.  If the assessment is a Written Assignment or Möbius Assignment and the absence is less than 48 hours, then a 48-hour extension will be granted.  For longer absences or for Unit Tests, the weight of the missed assessment will be shifted to the Final Exam.  In all cases, you must email your instructor to receive an accommodation.  </p>
