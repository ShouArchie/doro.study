  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>MATH 699:</div>
<p>The capstone course is designed to give students an opportunity to showcase the knowledge they have gained and to provide a forum for bringing that knowledge into their own classroom.  As part of this course students will design a mini-course on an approved subject in mathematics.</p>
<div>

</div>
<div>
<h3>Editorial Review</h3><p>After your project proposal has been accepted by the course instructor, every student will be introduced to their Editorial Reviewer. Your Editorial Reviewer will be responsible for your credit/no credit evaluation in MATH 699.</p><h3>Peer Review</h3><p>Should you choose to opt into the (optional) peer review process, you will also be introduced to your Peer Reviewer after your proposal has been accepted by the course instructor. Your peer will review your Capstone and you will review theirs.</p>

<h2>
  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>No explicit learning outcomes defined for this course.</div>
<div>
<h3> Project Requirements</h3><ul><li>Students create a mini-course on a single mathematical enrichment topic. The course created will be roughly three one-hour lessons that include both teaching and mathematical problem solving.</li><li>An enrichment topic means a topic that is outside of the union of the curriculum documents (including courses that are not mathematics) for a generic jurisdiction. For example, teaching calculus to Grade 10 students would not count as an enrichment topic.</li><li>The mini-course can be aimed at any level from Grade 9 to Grade 12 (or college for college teachers).</li><li>The mini-course can be approached from a number of different angles, including an historical angle, a contest preparation angle, etc.</li><li>We encourage you to create a written mini-course (eg. course notes, lesson plans, problem set with solutions) rather than a multimedia mini-course, because of the time investment required in the latter. We will not prevent you from doing a multimedia version, but wont encourage you in this direction.</li><li>It is hoped (but not a strict requirement) that all written work is completed in LaTeX.</li><li>It is hoped (but not a strict requirement) that students use the APA citation style. See the <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/MMT?hs=a">University of Waterloo MMT Library Guide</a> resource under the tab Cite/reference for further direction regarding the APA citation style. The Avoid Plagiarism link gives many examples on how to cite and paraphrase properly.</li><li>Students are to submit a maximum of 30 pages of written work; roughly 18 pages of course notes (lessons), 3 pages of problems (student exercises), 9 pages of solutions. Please note that Editorial Reviewers will not read (and thus not evaluate) past the 30th page of your project (with the exception of Appendices and/or Bibliography).</li><li>Students may propose a different type of idea for their capstone project, but acceptance of this will depend on many factors, including suitability and availability of supervisors, and is not guaranteed.</li></ul><p><strong>The capstone project is intended to be an independent project. While there will be some support available to students working on their projects, the intention is that the projects be completed largely independently and that students consult outside sources for help.</strong></p>

<figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Project Elements</th><th>Due Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Project Proposal</strong> </td><td><p>The <i>Project Proposal </i>identifies the topic, target audience and presentation format that you have chosen. You will be asked to provide a detailed outline which includes a course description, a list of student learning objectives, exercise examples and identifying source material. View the document <i>Proposal Example.pdf</i> to see an illustration. Modify the document <i>Proposal Form.tex</i> and submit the corresponding pdf file. You are also required at this time to indicate whether or not you will be participating in the voluntary peer review. Please answer yes or no to this question at the bottom of the Proposal Form. </p><p>The Capstone Coordinator's evaluation of your proposal will be left for you within the course dropbox in LEARN.</p></td><td>Friday, January 17, 2025</td></tr><tr><td><strong>First Edition and Annotated Bibliography</strong></td><td><p>The First Edition is a complete version of your project. A second, revised edition will be required later. Use the quality of a typical high school mathematics textbook as a standard. For a marking rubric of sorts, see the document <i>Editorial Guidelines.pdf</i>. Some projects from a previous offering of this course will be made available in the "Project Examples" folder as samples. </p><p>An <i>Annotated Bibliography</i> provides content summaries of your source material. This First Edition will include an Annotated Bibliography. See the section Source Material within<i> Proposal Example.pdf</i> or view past Capstone projects in the Project Examples folder for illustrations of an Annotated Bibliography. </p><p>In LaTeX, a bibliography can be created and stored separately in a .bib file. While not necessary, this approach to creating your bibliography is much easier than doing so manually and also simplifies your document citations. Students may refamiliarize themselves with creating Bibliographies in LaTeX using the Math 600 resources posted to the Resources page in LEARN.</p><p><strong>In addition to submitting to the course drop box, you will email your Editorial Reviewer (and if participating, your Peer Reviewer) a copy of your </strong><i><strong>First Edition</strong></i>. Please note that your Editorial Reviewer and your Peer Reviewer do NOT have access to your course drop box. </p><p>Any student who submits their <i>First Edition</i> and subsequently withdraws from MATH 699 or receives an NCR grade for the course will be required to choose a different Capstone topic the next time they enrol in MATH 699.</p></td><td>Friday, March 21, 2025</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Peer Review</strong></td><td><p>If you are participating in the <i>Peer Review</i>, you will receive a random classmate's First Edition on or before Friday, March 28, 2025. You will be expected to edit the writing, and verify the mathematics. Expectations are contained in the document <i>Peer Review Guidelines.pdf</i>. </p><p>Modify the document <i>Peer Review Form.tex</i> and email the corresponding pdf file to the classmate whose project you have reviewed.</p></td><td>Friday, March 28, 2025</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Final Edition</strong></td><td><p>The <i>Final Edition</i> should take into account editorial suggestions, peer suggestions if applicable, additional research and your own revisions. The Final Edition will also include an Annotated Bibliography. </p><p>Submit your Final Edition to the course drop box and email it to your Editorial Reviewer. Final Editions are not sent to Peer Reviewers.</p></td><td>Friday, April 11, 2025</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Please see the <strong>Course Schedule</strong> in LEARN for additional details.</p>

<div>
<h3>Academic Integrity</h3><p>Academic integrity is important in the MMT. As teachers, we expect you to maintain at least as high a standard of integrity as you would expect of your own students. It is your responsibility to understand where these boundaries lie. For example,</p><ul><li>reusing material that you produced in another course without consulting your instructor and acknowledging this reuse would be considered an academic offence, and</li><li>reproducing the work of others, including mathematics, without giving credit to the author or creator is an academic offence.</li></ul><p>The University has resources to help with this that can be accessed from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/integrity-students">Office of Academic Integrity's Integrity for Students</a> page.</p><p>MMT instructors and program personnel are happy to discuss any concerns that you have.</p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p><h3>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) </h3><p>This course includes the independent development of a mini-course on a mathematical enrichment topic. Therefore, the use of GenAI trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete any portion of your Capstone is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the authors original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (ICAI, n.d.). You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of your work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not succiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https: //uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence ">https: //uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence </a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h3>Diversity</h3><p>It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, and that students learning needs be addressed both in and out of class. We recognize the immense value of the diversity in identities, perspectives, and contributions that students bring, and the benefit it has on our educational environment. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. </p><p>In particular: We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternate/preferred name or gender pronoun. If you change your name or pronoun information in Quest after the first day of class, please let us know so we can update our records. Quest does not send instructors notifications of these changes. We will honour your religious holidays and celebrations. Please inform us of these at the start of the course. We will follow AccessAbility Services guidelines and protocols on how to best support students with different learning needs.</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
