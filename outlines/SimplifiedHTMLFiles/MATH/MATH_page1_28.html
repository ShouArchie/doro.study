<p>What is calculus? In essence, it is the study of the infinite and the infinitesimal. The infinitely large and infinitely small. We will study these ideas as they relate to sequences and functions. Then, we will use the tools we discover to solve problems and expand our knowledge. The main focus of the course will be approximation, as we examine how to approximate solutions to difficult (or even impossible) to solve problems. The course can be broken down into three main parts. First, we will examine sequences and what it means for one to converge. Next, we will use our knowledge of sequences to discuss functions, including limits and derivatives. This will allow us to develop a powerful theorem, the Mean Value Theorem, and we will examine its many applications. </p>

<p><strong>PIAZZA/EMAIL</strong></p><p><a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/math137/home">Piazza</a> is an elegant way to organize various communications throughout the course. This includes certain announcements and questions that you may have. You should think of Piazza as the place to ask questions about math. If you have a question regarding any of the problems, content, or basically anything you think would help others then please post a public question on Piazza so that everyone can see the answer. You can make yourself anonymous on a post‐by‐post basis if you feel the need. Private questions are acceptable too just think about the nature of your question before deciding the visibility status. Note that Piazza supports LaTeX syntax for Math. There’s also a built‐in formula editor that ultimately pastes the LaTeX code. Click <a href="http://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf">here</a> for a good LaTeX primer.<br/><br/>For administrative questions (e.g. enrollment changes, technical problems etc.) please use<strong> math137@uwaterloo.ca.</strong> You should think of this email address as the place to ask non‐math questions (including remark requests).</p>

<h2><strong>Quizzes (20%)</strong></h2><p>Quizzes will be written during your tutorial timeslot on <strong>Wednesdays </strong>from <strong>5:30 - 6:20 PM. </strong>You will have an <strong>assigned </strong>seat each week and you <strong>MUST </strong>write your quiz in that assigned seat. You seat will be available a few days before each quiz on Odyssey.  <strong>Note that you should ignore your tutorial location on Quest and follow the information on Odyssey!!</strong></p><p>Quizzes will be <strong>closed book </strong>with <strong>no aids allowed </strong>and you will have <strong>35 minutes</strong> to complete each quiz. In general, the testable content for Quiz N is covered in Week N of the course schedule.</p><p>Missed quizzes will be given a mark of zero unless valid documentation is provided (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations</a>).</p><p>To help you prepare for the quizzes, practice problem sets will be posted on LEARN 1-2 weeks before the quiz. There will be at least one very similar (or even identical) problem that is common to both the practice problem sets and the quiz you will be writing!</p><p>Your quiz average will be calculated based on the best 9 of 10 quizzes. That is, your lowest quiz score will be dropped.</p><h2><strong>Midterm (30%) and Final Exam (50%)</strong></h2><p>The midterm and the final exams will be written in person. <strong>The midterm is scheduled for February 24th, 7:00 pm - 8:50 pm.</strong> If you are unable to write the midterm (for example, you are sick) then valid documentation (such as a University of Waterloo Verification of Illness form) should be submitted to the Math Undergraduate Office (MC 4022, mathuo@uwaterloo.ca), following the instructions here: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations</a>. In this case, the weight of the midterm will shift to your final exam. That is, if you are exempted from the midterm, your final will be worth 80%. <strong>There will be NO make-up midterm.</strong><br/><br/>The final exam will be scheduled by the registrar's office. Details will be posted on LEARN. If you miss the final exam, you must have a valid reason and provide appropriate supporting documentation to the Math Undergraduate Oﬃce (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations</a>). Absence from the ﬁnal exam may result in a grade of INC or DNW at the discretion of the instructional team. To be considered for an INC, you must have a passing grade on the midterm test and an overall average of at least 50% on the quizzes. (See <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/incomplete-procedure">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/incomplete-procedure</a>.)<br/> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
