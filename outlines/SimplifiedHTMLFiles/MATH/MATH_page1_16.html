<p><strong>QUIZZES</strong><br/>Quizzes will be held during the weekly tutorial (TUT) time slot on Mondays from 5:30-6:20 PM. There will be 9 quizzes throughout the term (see schedule above). <strong>All quizzes will use assigned seating.</strong> You can find your assigned seat here: <a href="https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca">https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca</a>.  Seat assignments will vary from week to week.<br/><br/>The questions on the quizzes (both multiple choice and full answer) can be anything covered in the course up to and including the section listed in the Assessment Schedule (posted on LEARN).  The quizzes will reflect the expectations for the midterm and final exam. To receive full marks on long answer questions, your solutions must be stated in a clear and logical form, and you must show all required steps. Marks may be deducted if your work is difficult to read or understand. The course notes contain mid-section exercises and end-of-section problems to help you prepare for the quizzes. There are also sample quizzes posted on LEARN. Complete solutions for the quizzes will be posted on LEARN shortly after they have been written.</p><p><strong>QUIZ POLICIES</strong><br/>(1) Instructions for what to do if you miss a quiz due to illness or other extenuating circumstances can be found <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/guidelines-undergraduate-science-instructors/policies-and-accommodations#vif">here</a>.<br/>(2) There are no make up quizzes. If you are excused from a quiz, the weight will be shifted to other assessments.<br/>(3) Once your graded quiz is returned you should review the solutions (posted on LEARN) and your own graded quiz. <strong>If you notice an error in the grading, you should contact your instructor.</strong> Requests to have your grade changed must be specific (indicating the relevant question(s) and what error was made) or they will be ignored. <strong>Requests to change quiz grades will only be accepted for seven (7) days following the date when the graded quizzes are returned to you. </strong>NOTE: regrade requests may result in your grade being lowered.</p><p>---------</p><p><strong>MOBIUS ASSIGNMENTS</strong><br/>Mobius Assignments will be due on Fridays at 11:59 PM approximately every two weeks (see schedule above). The Mobius assignments are designed to give you practice using technology to explore content from the course. You will have an unlimited number of attempts to complete each Mobius assignment before the 11:59 PM deadline. Complete solutions for the Mobius assignments will be posted on LEARN shortly after they have<br/>been written.</p><p><strong>MOBIUS ASSIGNMENT POLICIES</strong><br/>(1) Instructions of what to do if you miss a Mobius assignment due to illness or other extenuating circumstances can be found <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/guidelines-undergraduate-science-instructors/policies-and-accommodations#vif">here</a>.<br/>(3) If you miss a Mobius assignment that you were not excused from, that Mobius assignment will be given a grade of 0.<br/>(4) There are no make up Mobius assignments. If you are excused from a Mobius assignment, the weight will be shifted to other assessments.<br/>(5) Since you have unlimited attempts before the deadline, there are no regrade requests for Mobius assignments.</p><p>---------</p><p><strong>MIDTERM &amp; FINAL EXAM</strong><br/>The midterm and final exam will be proctored exams held in person.</p><p>The <strong>midterm will be held on Thursday February 27th, 4:30-6:20 PM.</strong> Location to be determined.</p><p>The final exam will be scheduled by the Registrar's office and held during the final examination period .<br/><br/><strong>EXAM POLICIES</strong><br/>(1) <strong>You must bring your Watcard to the midterm &amp; final exam.</strong><br/>(2) If you miss the midterm due to illness, you must provide appropriate documentation within 48 hours of the midterm. If you are excused from the midterm the weight of the midterm will be transferred to your final exam. If you do not provide appropriate documentation within 48 hours or if you miss the midterm for any other reason, you will be given a midterm grade of 0.<br/>(3) If you miss the final exam due to illness, you must provide appropriate documentation and contact your instructor as soon as possible to discuss possible accommodations. </p><p>---------<br/><br/><strong>OPTIONAL MIDTERM REWRITE</strong><br/>This is an opportunity to improve on your midterm grade!<br/><strong>NOTE: </strong>You must have written the midterm on Thursday February 27th and register for the rewrite to be allowed to do the rewrite. Information on how to register will be given once the midterm grades are released.<br/><strong>When: </strong>Monday March 10th from 5:30 - 6:50 PM in your tutorial (TUT) time slot (there is no quiz that day).<br/><strong>Location: </strong>To be determined.<br/><strong>Information: </strong>The questions on the rewrite will be very similar to those on the midterm. The idea is that you can demonstrate that you have improved your understanding and corrected the mistakes you made on the original midterm. To facilitate that, you will receive your marked midterm several days before the optional midterm rewrite to give you time to do further study and to decide whether you want to write the optional midterm rewrite.</p><p><strong>How it affects your grade:</strong> If you write the optional midterm rewrite, then your midterm grade will be recalculated as:<br/>maximum [ original midterm score, (original midterm score + optional rewrite score)/2 ]<br/>For example:<br/>- If you get 50% on the midterm and get 80% on the rewrite, then your midterm grade would be recalculated as (50 + 80)/2 = 65%.<br/>- If you get 60% on the midterm and get 50% on the rewrite, then your midterm grade will be 60%.<br/><br/><strong>Writing the optional midterm rewrite cannot lower your midterm grade.</strong><br/><br/><strong>OPTIONAL MIDTERM REWRITE POLICIES</strong><br/>(1) <strong>You must bring your Watcard to the optional midterm rewrite.</strong><br/>(2) You must have written the midterm on February 27th to be allowed to do the rewrite.<br/>(3) Due to the nature of the optional midterm rewrite, there are no accommodations if you are unable to write it at the scheduled time.</p>

Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
