<p><strong><u>Assignment 0 - Due by 11:59pm EST on Friday, January 10.</u></strong></p><p>This multiple choice "assignment" is designed to assess your understanding of our course outline and the structure of the course. You can access it from the LEARN homepage by clicking the <i>Submit</i> button and then navigating to <i>Quizzes </i>or by using the following <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/lms/quizzing/admin/quizzes_manage.d2l?ou=1097666&amp;dst=1">link</a>. You may attempt this assignment as many times as you like until the deadline. Only your highest score will count.</p><p><u>While this assignment is not for marks, completing it with a score of 100% will make you eligible to drop your lowest tutorial assignment of the term.</u> </p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Tutorial Assignments:</u></strong></p><p>Each tutorial will feature a graded problem set designed to get you thinking at a deeper level about the material. You may also see some new content that augments what was discussed in class. It is strongly recommended that you prepare for the tutorials in advance by attempting the practice problems on LEARN and reviewing your notes from the previous week of class.  Additional practice problems can be accessed using the Mobius link on the LEARN homepage. Mobius problems are purely optional.</p><p>Tutorial assignments need to be completed within the timeslot of the tutorial, in your assigned tutorial room.  The tutorial assignment questions will be given to you at the beginning of your tutorial, and your completed solutions must be submitted (on paper; electronic submissions will not be accepted) by the end of the tutorial session.<br/> </p><ul><li><strong>Group Work on Tutorial Assignments:</strong>  You may solve the problems in a group of up to 3 people, or individually if you prefer. If working in a group, you must indicate on your assignment who you worked with. Each group member must write and submit their own solutions, in their own words. <br/><br/>The objective in allowing you to work with other students is to help with the learning process; so long as you are discussing the concepts and teaching each other math, it is permitted.  It is NOT permitted to copy solutions that you didn’t write or do not understand, in whole or in part, including solutions written by other students or somebody online. Exchanging ideas is encouraged, but the final submission <u>must</u> be your own work.<br/> </li><li><strong>Permitted Resources: </strong>In the tutorial you are permitted to use your personal notes, any resources on the MATH 118 LEARN page, and a scientific (non-graphing) calculator. No other resources are permitted.  You may not use any online resources other than the MATH 118 LEARN site.<br/> </li><li><strong>Tutorial Bonus: </strong>Students who attend all tutorials for their section and effortfully attempt all tutorial assignments will receive a 1% bonus to their final course grade. <u>Verified absences reported through Quest or approved by your instructor will not prevent you from earning the tutorial bonus.</u><br/> </li></ul><p><strong><u>Exams:</u></strong></p><p>MATH 118 features two in-person exams. Calculators are not permitted.</p><ul><li><strong>Midterm: </strong>Monday, February 24, 2:30-4:00<br/> </li><li><strong>Final Exam: </strong>The final exam schedule will be posted at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/exam-schedule">this link</a> in early February.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><u>Regrade Requests:</u></strong></p><p>A regrade on an assignment or exam may result in an increase, decrease, or no change in grade. You must be specific when asking for reconsideration of your work: requests for more marks without justification or reference to a specific question will not be considered. </p><ul><li><strong>Tutorials: </strong>Please direct tutorial regrades to the attention of your tutorial TA. After receiving a graded tutorial assignment, any concerns about the grading should be brought to the attention of your TA by the end of the next tutorial session.<strong> </strong>(e.g., if a graded assignment is returned to you during Tutorial 2, please bring any grading concerns to your TA by the end of Tutorial 3.)<br/> </li><li><strong>Exams: </strong>Please direct exam regrade requests to the attention of your instructor.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><u>Declaring absences:</u></strong> </p><p>Self-declared absences (for COVID-19 and short-term absences up to 2 days) and religious accommodation requests must be submitted through <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students"><u>Quest</u></a>. Absences requiring documentation (e.g., Verification of Illness Form, bereavement, etc.) are to be uploaded by completing the form on the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/"><u>VIF System</u></a>. The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services"><u>UWaterloo Verification of Illness form</u></a>, completed by a health professional, is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not send documentation to your advisor, course instructor, teaching assistant, or lab coordinator. Submission through the VIF System, once approved, will notify your instructors of your absence.</p><p> </p><p>An approved absence from a tutorial will typically result in its weight distributed amongst the other tutorials. An approved absence from the midterm will typically result in its weight shifted to the final exam. There will be no make up midterm. </p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Rescheduling Co-op Interviews:</u> </strong></p><p>As best as possible, coop interviews should be scheduled around your academic commitments. Unavoidable tutorial conflicts with coop interviews should be communicated to your instructor by email. Attendance at coop interviews is not considered to be a valid reason to miss an exam, hence you will be expected to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts"><u>reschedule any co-op interviews</u></a> that conflict with midterms or finals.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
