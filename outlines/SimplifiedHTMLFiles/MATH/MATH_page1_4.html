<div>
<p>This course provides an introduction to the applications of differential and integral calculus in business, the behavioural sciences, and the social sciences.</p><p>The course starts with the general idea of a limit, which underlies the various branches of calculus. A special type of limit will give rise to the derivative, the central idea in differential calculus. The interpretation of the derivative in applications such as rates of change and optimization, where the situations can be modelled by algebraic, exponential, or logarithmic functions, will be examined.</p><p>The concepts of the antiderivative and the indefinite integral will be studied. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus will relate the integral to the derivative. The problem of calculating the area under a curve will lead to the definite integral, a basic concept of integral calculus. The interpretation of the integral in various applications will be studied.</p>

<p><strong>Mobius Quizzes (10%):</strong> Mobius quizzes provide opportunities to practice the mechanics of the material. Mobius Quizzes are due on Thursdays at 5:00 p.m. ET.  You have 3 attempts at each quiz.  Your highest mark on a quiz will count toward your final grade.  After submitting a quiz, you will receive your grade immediately, however you will not be told which questions you had correct or incorrect until after the quiz deadline has passed. The time needed to complete each quiz will vary, and thus it is recommended that you begin your first quiz attempt as soon as possible.  Quizzes submitted after the due date will not be graded.</p><p><strong>Crowdmark Written Assignments (30%):</strong> Written assignments allow you to go more in depth with the material and familiarize yourself with the theory and conceptual side of the course. Written Assignments are due on Thursdays at 5:00 p.m. ET.  Each of these written assignments will be submitted through Crowdmark.  Crowdmark is set to apply a 1% per minute late penalty to all written assignments.  Written Assignments will be marked for clarity and completeness and accuracy.  Simple stating a correct final answer without the required explanation will not earn full marks.  Assignments will be released one week in advance of the due date.  Collaboration is inevitable, but the work you turn in must be your own. You are strongly encouraged to discuss high level ideas with your peers, but not to look at your peer's written answers - this is where issues begin. No copying, partial or whole, is allowed.</p><p><strong>Final Exam (60%): </strong>The final exam will take place in person and administered through the Centre for Extended Learning. It will be a closed book, cumulative exam (inclusive of content from the first lesson to the final lesson) lasting 150 minutes.  If you miss the final exam, you must have a valid reason and provide appropriate supporting documentation to the Math Undergraduate Oﬃce (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations</a>). Absence from the ﬁnal exam may result in a grade of INC or DNW at the discretion of the instructional team. To be considered for an INC, you must have an overall average of at least 50% on your written assignments. (See <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/incomplete-procedure">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/incomplete-procedure</a>.)</p>

<h3>Course Policies</h3><p>You must pass the final examination (earn at least 50%) in order to pass this course.</p><h4>LATE SUBMISSIONS</h4><p>No late Quiz submissions will be accepted.</p><p>Dropping the value of 1 of each type of assignment (written and Möbius) will ensure that a poor outcome during the term, due to illness or other personal issues, will not negatively affect your overall performance in the course. </p><p>There will be a 1% penalty per minute for late written assignments.</p><p>For Crowdmark assignments and quizzes, you are encouraged to discuss the concepts with each other,  but you should sit down on your own and complete the problems individually. You are strongly advised to post your course-related questions on Piazza and encouraged to answer other students' questions but do not post partial or complete solutions to the assignments.</p><p>The assignments and assessments are protected by copyright. Reproduction or dissemination of these documents in any manner whatsoever (e.g., sharing the content with other students, or posting them online), without the express permission of the instructor, is strictly prohibited.</p><h4>RE-GRADE REQUESTS</h4><p>In the event you feel the TA marked your assignment or midterm incorrectly, you can request a re-mark. Note there is a 24-hour cool-down period. This means that I will NOT be accepting re-mark requests until 24 hours after marks are released.</p><p>Further, note that the entire assessment will be re-marked. This means your mark could <strong>decrease</strong>, stay the same, or increase. If you are still interested in having your assessment re-marked, please email me. In your re-mark request, you must explain where you think the TA made an error. It is not enough to say that you feel you deserve more credit; there must have been an error in the marking! You will only receive a response via email when re-marking is done, which is completed in bulk on a weekly basis.</p><p>You MUST review the posted solutions prior to requesting re-grading. If your query is answered by reading the solutions, or you email me during the cool-down period, then your request will be returned to you for re-submission prior to the deadline.</p><p>Re-grade requests and any re-submission of requests must be submitted no later than a week after you receive back your assessment results.</p><h4>DECLARING ABSENCES </h4><p>Self-declared absences (for short-term absences up to 2 days) must be submitted through <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">Quest</a>. Absences requiring documentation (e.g., Verification of Illness Form, bereavement, etc.) are to be uploaded by completing the form on the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">VIF System</a>. The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">UWaterloo Verification of Illness form</a>, completed by a health professional, is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not send documentation to your advisor, course instructor, teaching assistant, or lab coordinator. </p><p><strong>After you submit your absence through the appropriate avenue, it is your responsibility to reach out to me within 48 hours to specifically indicate which assessment marks require accommodation during your absence period.</strong></p><h4>MENTAL HEALTH</h4><p>Please don't hesitate to make use of the services below if you are feeling overwhelmed or have the slightest inclination that you are in need of some support. </p><p><strong>On-campus Resources:</strong><br/>Campus Wellness <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</a><br/>Counselling Services: <a href="mailto:counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca/">counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca/</a> 519-888-4567 ext 32655<br/>MATES: one-to-one peer support program offered by Federation of Students (FEDS) and Counselling Services: <a href="mailto:mates@uwaterloo.ca">mates@uwaterloo.ca</a><br/>Health Services: located across the creek from the Student Life Centre, 519-888-4096.<br/><br/><strong>Off-campus Resources: </strong><br/>Good2Talk (24/7): Free confidential helpline for post-secondary students.

We recognize the immense value of the diversity in identities, perspectives, and contributions that students bring, and the benefit it has on our educational environment. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. </p><p>In particular:</p><ul><li>We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternate/preferred name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the semester so we may make appropriate changes to our records.</li><li>We will try to honour your religious holidays and celebrations. Please inform of us these at the start of the course.</li><li>We will follow AccessAbility Services guidelines and protocols on how to best support students with diﬀerent learning needs.</li></ul><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as mathematical tool-building and function sketching. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples.
