<div>
<p>MATH 239 is an introduction to combinatorics with a particular focus on counting techniques and graph theory. We will approach the counting problems using algebraic techniques in the form of generating series. We will use generating series to count (0,1)-strings with various restrictions and to solve linear recurrence relations. In graph theory we will consider paths and cycles, connectivity, Euler tours, spanning trees, bipartite graphs, planar graphs, matching in bipartite graphs.</p>

<p><strong>Grading schemes</strong>.<strong> </strong>Your grade will be the <i>better</i> of Grading Scheme A and Grading Scheme B whether you write the midterm or not.</p><p>All students are encouraged to write the midterm exam. However, we understand that, due to illness, schedule conflicts, or other unforeseen circumstances, this may not be possible. For this reason we are providing all students the option of not writing the midterm exam. If you do not write the midterm exam, then your final exam will count for 80% of your grade (i.e. we will use Grading Scheme B for your grade).  <strong>Please be aware that in previous offerings of Math 239, roughly half of the students who chose the option of not writing the midterm failed the course. </strong></p><p><br/><strong>Assignments</strong>. Assignments are to be done individually. Students are encouraged to collaborate on solving the questions but each student must write their own solutions independently in their own words. This is in contrast to the tutorial questions which are to be done together with your tutorial groups.</p><p>Assignments are <strong>due on Fridays at 10pm Waterloo time</strong>.  Assignments will be submitted using crowdmark.  Late submissions will receive a grade of 0. To accommodate for minor technical issues that you may experience, the Crowdmark deadline will be set for 10:30, but the assigned deadline is 10pm. If you encounter technical issues at 10:30, then you have missed the deadline and no accommodations will be made. </p><p>The <i>two</i> lowest assignment grades will be dropped, to allow for unforeseen circumstances such as late enrolment or short-term illness. Accommodations will be made if you cannot complete two or more assignments due to  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/vif-submission">documented</a> illness; contact your instructor to be sure that they are aware that you require such accommodations. </p><p>Many of the assignment questions will require you to write proofs.  Aim to present your proofs at a level that would be understood by an average student in the class who has not thought about the problem yet. Your proofs will be evaluated on the logic and presentation of your ideas.</p><p>For assignments you are allowed to use only the following materials:</p><ul><li>all of the material posted on the MATH239 Learn course webpage</li><li>all of the material on the MATH239 Piazza webpage</li><li>all of the material presented during lectures, tutorials, oﬃce hours or provided to you directly by TAs and instructors.</li></ul><p>If you believe the grader has made an error in grading your assignment, you may request a regrade. Information about requesting a regrade will be posted on Learn. <i>Any such request must be made within 1 week of receiving the graded assignment.</i> The grader may look at all problems on the assignment and adjust your grade in any or all of them. Grades will only be changed if there was an error in grading, as opposed to subjective differences about the value of a particular solution.</p><p><strong>Accommodations. </strong>Other than accommodations offered through AccessAbility Services, the accommodations have mostly been incorporated into the grading scheme. They include: additional 30 mins time to submit assignments to accommodate technical issues. Dropping the two lowest assignment grades to accommodate for short term illness, late enrolment, or failure to meet the deadline. Two grading schemes to accommodate for students cannot write the midterm.  For the vast majority of students, there will be no additional need for accommodations. However, further accommodations will be made if you cannot complete two or more assignments due to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/vif-submission">documented</a> illness. Should you need further accommodations contact your instructor.  (<strong>Do not contact the TAs or instructors of other sections.)</strong></p><p><strong>Tutorials</strong>. Graduate student TAs will be responsible for the tutorials. The tutorials will begin on Monday January 16.</p><p><strong>Exams</strong>. There will be midterm exam (<strong>4:30-6:20pm on March 6)</strong> and a ﬁnal exam (to be scheduled by the registrar during the ﬁnal exam period). Both exams will take place on campus unless the university guidance prohibits in‐person exams for public health reasons.</p><p><strong>Incomplete grades (INC). </strong>Students who cannot write the final exam due to illness <i>may</i> be given the grade INC. Requests for an INC grade will not be automatically granted. Your instructor will consider your performance on the midterm and on assignments. A passing grade on the midterm, in addition to approved <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/vif-submission">VIF documentation</a>, will be sufficient grounds for granting an INC grade.</p>

Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In particular: We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternative/preferred name or gender pronoun.

Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
