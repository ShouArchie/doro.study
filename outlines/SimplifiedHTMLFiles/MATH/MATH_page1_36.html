<h3>Mobius and Written Assignments</h3><p>There will be 12 equally weighted Mobius Assignments and 11 equally weighted written assignments. The topics covered in assignment <i>n</i> are those of Week <i>n. </i></p><p>Mobius Assignments (accessed through LEARN) will be available from 8:30 a.m. on Monday of Week <i>n</i> to 8:30 a.m. on Monday of Week <i>n+1 </i>(<strong>exception: 12:00 a.m. Jan 7 to 5 p.m. Jan 16 for Week 1</strong>). There is no time limit but you must complete and submit your Mobius Assignments within these periods. Mobius assignments are graded for completion, rather than accuracy. No extensions will be granted except in the event of technical issues affecting the whole class.</p><p>Written Assignment questions will be posted in LEARN by 8:30 a.m. on Thursday of Week <i>n</i> and should be submitted in Crowdmark by 5:00 p.m. on Thursday of Week <i>n+1</i>. Late submissions will be accepted with a penalty of 2% per hour up to 24 hours after the deadline. The penalty will be waived for the first 10 minutes.</p><p>N.B. There is no Written Assignment for topics from Week 12 but these topics will be covered in the Final Exam.</p><p>Your lowest Written Assignment score will be dropped from the final grade calculation. If you miss more than one due to illness or other circumstances, please discuss this with the instructor. The weighting for your overall grade may be adjusted if you are given exemptions. </p><p>You are permitted to work together on assignment problems, with certain limitations. Rules for collaborative work can be found on the LEARN course site.</p><p>You may post questions and answers in Piazza about assignments but this should be limited to clarifications about the problems and brief hints.</p><h4>Re-mark Request Policy</h4><p>If you believe there is a problem with how your Mobius or written assignment was graded, you may request a re-mark on that assignment. Re-mark requests are sent to your instructor and then directed to the TA, who marks the relevant question/s.</p><p>Re-mark requests must be submitted within <strong>one week</strong> of receiving your graded work.</p><p>Your request must include a detailed description of the issues with the marking, referring to your solutions and those provided by the teaching team. If you submit a re-mark request without a description or explanation, you will be asked to provide details. An email template for re-mark requests is provided in LEARN.</p><h3>Final Exam</h3><p>The final exam will be registrar-scheduled and in-person, with a duration of 150 minutes. It will also be closed-book with no calculators permitted.</p><p>If you are taking on-campus courses, you will be scheduled to write the exam on-campus. Otherwise, you will need to make arrangements to write the exam at an exam centre or with a proctor. Please do this as soon as possible and be aware of the deadline for this. The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/extended-learning/learn-online/write-exams">CEL webpage</a> has more details about exam arrangements.</p><p><strong>You must earn a grade of at least 50% in the Final Exam to pass the course.</strong> If your Final Exam grade is below 50%, then it will be used as your Final Grade.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Late Enrollment:</strong> If you enroll in this course after the start of the term (up to the deadline for adding classes), you may be exempted from any assignments that have already been posted. It is, however, in your interest to make sure you are able to do them as part of catching up with the rest of the class. The TAs and instructor would be glad to help you catch up on topics that you missed.</p><p><strong>Generative AI:</strong> Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
