  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>PHIL 258 / SCI 267:</div>
<p>This course considers fundamental questions concerning the nature of science. Consideration is given to such topics as scientific methodology, scientific revolutions, natural laws, and the debate about whether scientific theories represent reality, or just our perceptions of reality.</p>

<p>The sciences are widely considered to be one of our best sources of knowledge about the world. In this course we will investigate the nature and status of scientific knowledge. Topics will include scientific methodology, the roles of values and social factors in scientific knowledge production, scientific revolutions, scientific explanation, and the scientific realism debate. We will study several different accounts of the methods used by scientists, including accounts proposed by Carnap, Popper, and Kuhn. We will also ask whether science describes reality. Does the real world actually contain electrons or genes, for example, or is a literal interpretation of our scientific theories unwarranted? This question is at the heart of the debate about scientific realism. Through readings and class discussions, students will learn how to apply and evaluate a range of accounts of how scientific knowledge is produced. In class activities and assessments will develop students’ reading comprehension and oral and written communication skills.</p><h2>Territorial Acknowledgement</h2><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p>

<h3>Expectations for Attendance and Participation in Class (not graded)</h3><p><strong>Regular attendance and participation in class is crucial because discussions are an essential part of the course content.</strong> In addition to the coursework requirements outlined below, it is expected that students will prepare for in class discussions by completing an initial reading of each of the required readings prior to the class for which they are assigned. If you are not able to attend a class due to illness or any other reason, you can catch up by doing the reading, reviewing lecture slides and class notes posted on LEARN, and coming to office hours to ask any questions you have about the material. (If you are unable to attend office hours, you may schedule an appointment with me at another time by email.)</p><h3>In Class Discussion Responses</h3><p>Each In Class Discussion Response will be a paragraph-length written response that follows an in class discussion. Students must be present in class for the relevant discussion to be eligible to submit an In Class Discussion Response. All students will be given 10 minutes to complete this 5 minute activity. Students may choose between either paper or electronic formats. Each submission will be graded out of a total of 3 marks and full marks will be awarded for a reasonable response. There will be three In Class Discussion Responses during the term and the best two out of the three will count towards your final grade. There will be no opportunity to make up missed In Class Discussion Responses. The flexible grading scheme is designed to accommodate typical reasons for occasional absences during the term (e.g., self-declared short-term absence, short-term illness, coop interviews). If there are extenuating circumstances (e.g., serious illness) that cause you to miss a significant amount of class time, contact Prof. Fraser to arrange an appropriate accommodation. Documentation of the extenuating circumstances may be required.  </p><h3>Quizzes</h3><p><strong>Quizzes will be written in person at the beginning of class on January 27, February 12, March 17, and April 2. </strong>Each quiz will consist of several short answer questions (i.e., requiring an answer of at most a few sentences) and one paragraph-length answer. Quizzes will cover material from class and from the assigned readings. Your best three quizzes (out of four) will count towards your final grade. Make up quizzes may only be written if there are extenuating circumstances (e.g., serious illness, death in the family) and if appropriate documentation is provided. Assessments in other courses do not qualify as an extenuating circumstance. If there are extenuating circumstances, you must contact me prior to the quiz (unless, of course, your extenuating circumstance prevents you from doing so). See the Declaring Absences subsection of the Administrative Policies section below for information about the process for submitting required documentation. </p><h3>Analysis of an Example</h3><p>Choose an example of a scientific discovery described in a contemporary source (e.g., <i>Globe and Mail</i>, <i>Science</i>). Explain how one of the accounts of science discussed in the course applies to your example. Maximum length 500 words (i.e., 2 pages doublespaced). A handout with a detailed description of the requirements will be posted on LEARN later in the term. Due <strong>before 11:59p.m. on</strong> <strong>March 10</strong>. Your assignment must be submitted electronically to the online Dropbox on the LEARN web site for this course. Late assignments will be penalized 10% per 24 hours unless there are extenuating circumstances (e.g., a grade of 72% would be reduced to 62% if the assignment is handed in up to 24 hours past the deadline). Extensions may be granted in extenuating circumstances (e.g., serious illness, death in the family). Assessments in other courses do not qualify as an extenuating circumstance. If there are extenuating circumstances, you must contact Prof. Fraser prior to the deadline (unless, of course, your extenuating circumstance prevents you from doing so). See the Declaring Absences subsection of the Administrative Policies section below for information about the process for submitting required documentation.</p><h3>Paper</h3><p>A short paper on a topic covered in the course. Maximum length 1,200 words (i.e., 4 pages doublespaced). A handout with paper topics and a detailed description of the requirements will be posted on the course web site later in the term. Due <strong>before 11:59p.m. on April 10</strong>. Your assignment must be submitted electronically to the online Dropbox on the LEARN web site for this course. Late papers will be penalized 10% per 24 hours unless there are extenuating circumstances (e.g., a grade of 72% would be reduced to 62% if the paper is handed in up to 24 hours past the deadline). Extensions may be granted in extenuating circumstances (e.g., serious illness, death in the family). Assessments in other courses do not qualify as an extenuating circumstance. If there are extenuating circumstances, you must contact Prof. Fraser prior to the deadline (unless, of course, your extenuating circumstance prevents you from doing so). See the Declaring Absences subsection of the Administrative Policies section below for information about the process for submitting required documentation.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Policies on Late Assignments for this Course</h4><p>The policies on late submission of assignments are set out in the Student Assessment section above. If there are extenuating circumstances that prevent you from handing in your work on time, please contact Prof. Fraser prior to the deadline to arrange accommodations. </p><h4>Policy on Laptops, Tablets, Phones, etc. in Class</h4><p>In the classroom, laptops and other electronic devices may only be used to access course materials. It is recommended that all electronic devices be placed in airplane mode during class. Please turn off the ringer on your phone prior to the start of class.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as formulating and evaluating arguments. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Writing and Communication Centre</h4><p>The Writing and Communication Centre (WCC) works with students as they develop their ideas, draft, and revise. Writing and communication specialists offer one-on-one support in planning assignments, synthesizing and citing research, organizing papers and reports, designing presentations and e-portfolios, and revising for clarity and coherence. </p><p>You can make multiple appointments throughout the term, or you can drop in at the Library for quick questions or feedback. To book a 25- or 50-minute appointment and to see drop-in hours, visit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/">the Writing and Communication Centre web site</a>. Group appointments for team-based projects, presentations, and papers are also available.</p><p>Please note that communication specialists guide you to see your work as readers would. They can teach you revising skills and strategies, but will not change or correct your work for you.</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system. The faculty and staff in Arts encourage students to seek out mental health support if they are needed.</p><p><strong>On campus supports</strong></p><p>For counselling (individual or group) reach out to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Campus Wellness and Counselling Services.</a> Counselling Services strives to provide a secure, supportive environment for students of all orientations and backgrounds.

If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6.</p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p>
