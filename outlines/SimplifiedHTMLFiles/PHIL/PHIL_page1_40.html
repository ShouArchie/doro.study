  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>PHIL 324:</div>
<p>An examination of central issues in social and political philosophy. This course draws on both contemporary and historical readings to discuss issues such as: Does the state have legitimate authority to govern? What is the just way to distribute resources? What is the value of equality? Of liberty? What rights, if any, do we have, and why?</p>

<div>
<p>How is political authority justified?  What is a just society? Students in this course will study a sample of key historical and contemporary texts addressing these questions, with an emphasis on liberal egalitarianism and its critics. A central focus of the course investigates the tension between natural freedom and political authority. We will look at various historical approaches to this tension on our way considering contemporary political philosophies that seek to resolve the tension in terms of considerations of egalitarian fairness. The later part of the course looks at criticisms of liberal egalitarian philosophy from work in feminism, disability theory, racial justice, and reparations. Theoretical developments that come from those criticisms are also examined. The themes of the course will be engaged critically, both in terms of readings that express opposing views, and in terms of students' own critical engagement with the issues in written work.</p>

<h3>Course Expectations</h3><p><strong>LEARN Access:</strong> This course requires regular access to the LEARN course site.

Make sure you read and understand these announcements.</p><p><strong>Weekly Readings and Lectures:</strong> Students are expected to keep up to date in the readings and lectures. Falling behind will make progress in the course difficult.</p><p><strong>Communication:</strong> All communication conducted through the LEARN site must be courteous and course-relevant. It is especially important that an atmosphere of mutual respect and course-focus be maintained in discussion forums.</p><h3>Course Policies</h3><p><strong>Late Policy for Essay Assignments: </strong>Late submission of essay assignments will be penalized at the rate of 10% per day late. This policy will apply without exception unless a documented excuse of sufficient weight is provided. See the section on "Declaring Absences" below for information on exceptions due to extenuating circumstances and how to provide documentation for them.</p><p><strong>Late Policy for Midterm and Final Take-home Examinations:</strong> Late submissions will ordinarily not be accepted. See the section on "Declaring Absences" below for information on exceptions due to extenuating circumstances and how to provide documentation for them.</p><p><strong>Note regarding AAS accommodation plans:</strong> Students entitled to accommodation through AccessAbility Services will need to submit a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/missed-course-component">Missed Course Component Form</a> in order to receive accommodation for any late assessments.</p><p><strong>Policy on Generative AI</strong><i><strong>: </strong></i>This course involves the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as critical thinking, textual analysis, evaluation of ideas and arguments, and academic writing. Since the assessments in this course are designed to evaluate your abilities with respect to these skills, <i><strong>the use use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools—for example, Chat GPT—at any stage in the production of content for submission on assessments is NOT permitted!</strong></i> Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/integrity-students">academic integrity</a>, including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).<i><strong> </strong></i></p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of your work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.   </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">Copyright Advisory Committee</a>.</p><h4><strong>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </strong></h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4><strong>Declaring absences</strong></h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
