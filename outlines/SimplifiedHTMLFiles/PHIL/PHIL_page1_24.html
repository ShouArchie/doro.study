<h3>Course Description</h3><p>When people arrive at implausible conclusions, it is common to say they are being “illogical". This everyday use of the word takes being illogical to be the same thing as engaging in bad thinking. Roughly speaking, bad thinking comes in two flavours: relying on bad information (“DeVidi is a platypus, platypuses originate in Australia, therefore his ancestors are from Australia") and making bad inferences ("DeVidi is a philosopher, therefore he is brave and good looking"), though the two are often combined ("DeVidi is a platypus, therefore he’s brave and good looking"). Being logical, then, would seem to amount to avoiding these two sorts of errors. But a more careful use of “logic" restricts it to avoiding the second sort of error, and that’s what we’ll do in this course. It is a course about good inferences, not about getting good information. We’ll be looking especially at those inferences which are, in a certain sense, the best possible — deductive inferences. These are the ones where the truth of the information we’re working with would guarantee the truth of the conclusions we draw from it. The systematic study of deductive inference is called Formal Logic.</p><p>Formal Logic is an ancient subject, going back at least to Aristotle, but for over 2000 years there was relatively little progress in logic, at least compared to other equally ancient subjects such as physics or mathematics. In the past 130 years or so, though, it has evolved and grown rapidly. Innovations and discoveries in formal logic lie at the heart of important developments in many disciplines, including cognitive science and artificial intelligence, theoretical computer science, linguistics, the foundations of mathematics, and others. Moreover, it is virtually impossible to read and understand large parts of the philosophical literature of the past 100 years without a good grasp of at least the basics of formal logic; this is most obvious in philosophy of science, philosophy of language, and epistemology, but is also true in areas like metaphysics, including meta-ethics and aesthetics.</p><p>In his Organon, Aristotle distinguishes two different reasons to study formal logic. You can regard it as a tool that helps you do a better job evaluating the reasoning of others and for improving your own. Or you can regard it as a science in its own right, the science of correct inference. This course will primarily be concerned with formal logic regarded as the science of correct inference. The systems of logic we will consider are theories about correct inference. As with any theory, the first step is to gain an understanding of the theory, and the bulk of our efforts will be devoted to helping students gain such an understand. But, as theories, it is appropriate to ask about them the sorts of questions one can ask about any theory: What evidence do we have that they are correct? To what range of phenomena do they apply? What idealizations are we making in supposing them to apply? If we produce a justification for belief in the correctness of the system, how do we know that the reasoning we use in our justification is correct if the inferences in the justification are part of the system? We shall also devote some attention to such theoretical and philosophical issues along the way.</p><p>We will begin with a short introduction to the basic concepts of logic, such as consistency, validity, and logical truth. The bulk of the course will introduce students to the two most widely used and discussed logical systems, namely classical propositional logic (which is also called classical sentential logic, or truth-functional logic) and classical predicate logic. If an ideal logical system would capture all (and only) the correct patterns of inference, each of these systems can be regarded as an approximation to this ideal which captures some but not all valid patterns of inference. For each system we will study: the relationship between the language of the system and ordinary languages like English; the relationship between validity in the system and logical validity; and various methods for showing validity (such as proof procedures) and invalidity (including semantic methods for producing counter-examples) of patterns of inference. We will conclude with a brief introduction to some of the metalogical concepts, such as soundness and completeness, that are the core of many more advanced studies in logic.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Course Access</h3><p>This course requires regular access to the Waterloo LEARN course site. Your instructor will use this site for communicating important information concerning course matters, returning graded assignments, etc. A reliable internet connection and regular checking of the course site (at least twice a week) is therefore mandatory.</p><h4>Late Assignments</h4><p>As a general rule, late assignments will not be accepted. However, sometimes things arise which quite legitimately make it impossible to complete work by the assigned deadlines — the world is all-too-full of unforeseeable catastrophes. If something of this sort happens, you will need to do two things. First, you will need to get documentation regarding your extenuating circumstances and submit it through the appropriate absence declaration process. (See the section below on "Declaring Absences".) Second, you will need to get in touch with your course instructor and let her or him know of the consideration you are seeking.  You will find that your instructor is quite reasonable about this... but remember that failure to budget your time doesn't count as an unforeseeable catastrophe!</p><p><strong>Note regarding AAS accommodation plans:</strong> Students entitled to accommodation through AccessAbility Services will need to submit a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/missed-course-component">Missed Course Component Form</a> in order to receive accommodation for any late assessments.</p><h3>Policy on Generative AI</h3><p>This course involves the independent development and practice of specific skills. Since the assessments in this course are designed to evaluate your abilities with respect to these skills, <i><strong>the use use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools—for example, Chat GPT—at any stage in the production of content for submission on assessments is NOT permitted! </strong></i>Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/integrity-students">academic integrity</a>, including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).<i><strong> </strong></i></p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of your work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.   </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</a>.</p><h4><strong>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </strong></h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4><strong>Declaring absences</strong></h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.
