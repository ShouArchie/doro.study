  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>PHIL 121:</div>
<p>This course surveys several controversial moral topics, and a range of philosophical views on each. Topics may include abortion, cloning, euthanasia and suicide, sexism, prostitution, pornography, torture, and animal rights.</p>
<div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>This course explores several pressing moral issues and considers some of the ways that the tools of Philosophy can help us to better understand and address those issues. Topics will include global poverty and inequality, climate change, structural oppression, the use of non-human animals, a topic that the class will choose together. The aim of the course is not to defend any particular conclusion on these moral issues. Rather, the aim is to give you the tools to think more clearly about some of the most pressing moral issues of our times, and to help you to develop and defend your own moral views.</p>

  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I hope you get a lot out of this class. I have two broad goals for every student. First, I hope that by learning about moral philosophy, you reflect on some difficult and important ethical questions— questions that are of enormous importance to our lives. By the end of the course, I hope you find that ethical questions are more common, and more difficult to answer, than you did at the outset. Second, I hope the course equips you with a range of philosophical skills and concepts with which to navigate these ethical challenges, and that these skills and concepts prove useful in studying topics other than ethics. These are very broad goals. To achieve them, I have several more specific learning objectives, which can be roughly grouped in three categories.</td>

<h3>Discussion Activities</h3><p>We will frequently devote class time to structured group discussion activities. Your Discussion Activities grade is the proportion of activities that you participate in. There are no ‘make up’ grades for missed activities, but you can miss up to 2 with no penalty. If you miss more than 50% of the activities, you will earn a grade of 0 on this portion of the class grade. For instance, if there are 10 activities and you complete 8/10, you will earn the full 10%. If you complete 6/10, you will earn 8%. If you complete 4/10, you earn 0%.</p><h3>Argument Summaries:</h3><p>The Argument Summary assignments ask you to briefly:</p><ul><li>Summarize two different perspectives on a moral issue. </li><li>Identify the main argument for each perspective.</li><li>Set out your own view of the issue.</li></ul><p>You need to submit two Argument Summaries over the course of the term, and you have a total of five opportunities: one for each topic we’ll discuss. You need to submit your first argument summary before Reading Week (i.e. by the end of Topic 2). You cannot submit Argument Summaries past the deadline for each topic. Detailed instructions and deadlines are available on LEARN.</p><h3>Topic Proposal</h3><p>You’ll notice that the final  topics on the schedule above are listed as TBD. That’s because the final  topic will be decided on collectively by you, the students in the class. Here’s how it will work: Each student is responsible for proposing one topic for the class to discuss. We will then discuss the proposals and decide collectively which ones to add to the course schedule.</p><ul><li>Topic proposals must be made on LEARN by <strong>Friday, February 7th at 11:59 pm</strong>.</li><li>Every proposal must include a potential reading relevant to the topic. These can be news stories, works of long-form journalism, government documents, reports by non-governmental agencies, academic research articles, blog posts, film clips… you have a lot of flexibility.</li><li>Proposals should be approximately 300-500 words and include: a brief description of the moral issue, the main question that the issue, and the relevance of the proposed reading(s) to the issue, and a brief argument for why the topic is interesting and important.</li></ul><h3>Midterm Test</h3><p>The midterm test will be written <strong>in class </strong>on <strong>Monday, February 10th. </strong>The test will assess your understanding of the material covered in the first two topics, and will include a mix of question formats, including multiple choice and longer multi-paragraph answers. </p><h3>Final Test</h3><p> The final test will be written i<strong>n class on Monday, March 31st.</strong> The test will focus on assessing your understanding of the material covered since the midterm test (i.e. the final three topics), but some questions may still draw on concepts introduced in the first half of the course. The test will include a mix of question formats, including multiple choice and longer multi-paragraph answers. </p><h3>Essay Outline</h3><ul><li>An important part of writing strong essays is planning the essay’s structure. Another important part of good writing is getting feedback from your peers. The Essay  Outline is meant to help with both.</li><li>Your Essay Outline  is due in the relevant Dropbox by <strong>Tuesday, April 1st. </strong></li><li>Our last class on <strong>Wednesday, April 2nd</strong> will be dedicated entirely to peer review of one another’s outlines. This will help you to plan the stricture of your paper, and to improve that structure in light of feedback from you classmates. It will also allow you the chance to give constructive feedback to your colleagues.</li><li>The Essay Outline outline is worth 5% of your grade: you will earn the full 5% if you submit an outline to the Dropbox on time and participate in the peer review activity April 2nd.</li><li>Specific instructions will be posted by <strong>Monday, March 17th.</strong></li></ul><h3>Final Essay</h3><ul><li>You will be asked to write an essay of approximately 1,500 words both explaining <i>and taking a stand on </i>one of the debates encountered in the class. Your essay should be based on your Outline, updated to reflect the feedback you received in the peer review activity.</li><li><strong>Due Wednesday, April 9th </strong>in the relevant LEARN Dropbox.</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p>

Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought.
