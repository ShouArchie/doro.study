  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>PHIL 201:</div>
<p>Classic and contemporary philosophical examination of sex and love. Questions considered might include the following: Do you love because your love-object is worthy, or do you find your love-object worthy because of your love for them? Does sex ever involve using persons as mere means to an end? Should it?</p>

<p>As in most branches of philosophy, philosophical thinking about sex and love encompasses a variety of theoretical approaches and perspectives on specific issues. This course aims to acquaint you with some of this variety, and to develop your understanding of the reasoning underlying the various perspectives we consider. It will also invite you to engage these perspectives actively and critically by developing your own analyses and reasoned evaluations of the views discussed. This approach will contribute to the development of your critical thinking skills — skills which are useful not only in philosophy, but in many other walks of life, both academic and non-academic. Our approach will also provide useful preparation for future courses in philosophy, especially higher-level courses in social and political philosophy.</p>

This policy will apply without exception unless a documented excuse of sufficient weight is provided. See the section on "Declaring Absences" below for information on exceptions due to extenuating circumstances and how to provide documentation for them.</p><h4>Late Policy for Midterm Take-home Examination</h4><p>Late submissions will ordinarily not be accepted. See the section on "Declaring Absences" below for information on exceptions due to extenuating circumstances and how to provide documentation for them.</p><h4>Late Policy for Take-home Final Examination</h4><p>Late submissions will ordinarily not be accepted. See the section on "Declaring Absences" below for information on exceptions due to extenuating circumstances and how to provide documentation for them.=</p><p><strong>Note regarding AAS accommodation plans:</strong> Students entitled to accommodation through AccessAbility Services will need to submit a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/missed-course-component">Missed Course Component Form</a> in order to receive accommodation for any late assessments.</p><h4>Policy on Generative AI</h4><p>This course involves the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as critical thinking, textual analysis, evaluation of ideas and arguments, and academic writing. Since the assessments in this course are designed to evaluate your abilities with respect to these skills, <i><strong>the use use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools—for example, Chat GPT—at any stage in the production of content for submission on assessments is NOT permitted!</strong></i> Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/integrity-students">academic integrity</a>, including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).<i><strong> </strong></i></p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, drafting notes, and earlier drafts of your work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor, TA, or course coordinator to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. If you are not sufficiently able to support the work as being your own, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.   </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</a>.</p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.

Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
