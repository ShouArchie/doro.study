I live and work on the <a href="http://www.sixnations.ca/LandsResources/HaldProc.htm">Haldimand Tract</a>, land granted to the Six Nations in 1784, which includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Before settlers came to this land, the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabeg were bound through <a href="https://nandogikendan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/69b9f-23-2-simpson.pdf">Gdoo-naaganinaa</a>, which means “One Dish” in Anishinaabemowin. It is also known as the Dish with One Spoon Treaty by the Haudenosaunee.</li><li>As a white scholar, I carry privilege within university spaces. The university as an institution was designed for white people like me. I am safe and comfortable within the university as a consequence of my white privilege. This is not true for Black, Indigenous, or other racialized people on campus. I am committed to challenging racist structures within the university.</li></ul><p>You are welcome to ask me about why I include these acknowledgements on my syllabus or suggest improvements I can make to wording or language. </p>

<p>Science fiction depicts alternate and weird possibilities. It can also uncritically reproduce biases of its time. In both cases, science fiction helps us explore philosophical questions about what it means to be human, what the world is really like, and how we might make our world better. </p><p>This course will cover questions that emerge in metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of language, philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, political philosophy, and moral philosophy. We will explore philosophical themes and learn how to evaluate philosophical arguments as they appear in science fiction media, especially in short stories, film, and television. </p><p>That being said, this course is not a systematic introduction to philosophy, nor is it an introduction to science fiction studies. It will, however, give you a foundation for applying philosophical modes of reasoning, whether in future philosophy courses, other disciplines, or in everyday life. </p><h3>What to expect in class.</h3><p>There will be minimal lecture in this class. We will practice critical reading, respectful discussion with peers, evaluating philosophical arguments, and presenting our own ideas. This is a new course for me as an instructor, so we may make adjustments as best suits the learning needs of the class as we go along. </p><p>Most of our time together will focus on discussing, as a class and in small groups, the assigned texts and the issues that most interest you about them. In general, I recommend having copies of written texts with you in class, and any time stamps for clips you may want to watch in class from the film and television media. The Scenes for Consideration (SFCs) assignment (explained below) will be the main way we structure discussions. </p><p>I will send updates to you between class meeting time using the announcements function on Learn. I recommend checking Learn and your UWaterloo email regularly (e.g, every 48 hours).</p><p>In my experience, the following strategies, expressed by the acronym <i><strong>PREP</strong></i>,<i><strong> </strong></i>support learning and success when adopted by students:</p><ul><li><strong>P</strong>repare for class</li><li><strong>R</strong>eflect (cognitively, emotionally)</li><li><strong>E</strong>ngage (participate)</li><li><strong>P</strong>ractice patience and compassion (towards yourself and others)</li></ul><p>There is also a <i><strong>Unicorn sprinkles </strong></i>discussion topic on Learn where you can post event announcements, cute animal pictures, media recommendations, recipes, or anything that you want to share with the class. </p><h3>What we can expect of each other.</h3><p>I use an equity-centered, trauma-informed approach in my teaching practice that emphasizes safety, trust, peer support, collaboration, and empowerment. </p><p>Because of our unique perspectives, we each have something to offer the class. To make space for diverse perspectives, our classroom and online learning space should be respectful and accessible. Class discussion and disagreement are encouraged within the context of a respectful environment. Oppressive or hateful speech will not be tolerated. </p><p>Be aware that some topics may bring up painful experiences for some members of class (and we cannot always predict what these topics may be). I welcome feedback throughout the semester about how to promote accessibility. </p><h4>Supports</h4><p>There are links at the end of the course outline to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students">AccessAbility Services</a> and to the form where you can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">self-declare an illness</a>, which sends a message to your professors. In addition, at the end of this outline and through the Mental Health Widget on the Course Home page, you can find links to mental health supports on and off campus.</p><p>If appropriate, you may also access support through student-run services, including <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/raise/">RAISE</a>, <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/glow/">GLOW</a>, the <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/womens-centre/">Women's Centre</a>, and <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/mates/">MATES</a>. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/stpauls/waterloo-indigenous-student-centre">Shatitsirótha’, the Waterloo Indigenous Student Centre</a>, supports Indigenous students. </p><p>The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/svpro">Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Office</a> (SVPRO) supports all members of the University of Waterloo campus community who have experienced, or been impacted, by sexual violence. SVPRO is guided by anti-oppressive, intersectional, trauma-informed, evidence-based and collaborative approaches. For a quick contact, email the SVPRO at <a href="mailto:svpro@uwaterloo.ca">svpro@uwaterloo.ca.</a> </p><p>There is also has <a href="https://uwaterloo-advocate.symplicity.com/care_report/index.php/pid860071?">an intake form</a> where members of the campus community can disclose harms and/or request support from SVPRO or from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R).</p><p> </p>

<h3><strong>Labour</strong></h3><p>Learning is an act of labour and public accountability. In this course, grades will be based on labour. </p><p>Part of the labour of learning entails reading the assigned material and communicating your thoughts and feelings in class through speaking, writing, or some other medium. You will earn an 80 in the course if you do the following:</p><ul><li>Attend 80% of class meetings and complete 80% of the readings</li><li>Complete five SFCs</li><li>Regularly make substantive contributions to class</li><li>Complete the two projects by the respective deadlines</li><li>Complete the Self-Assessment by the deadline</li></ul><p>I have high expectations for your work. Assignments are expected to be thoughtful and thorough. Work that is incomplete or does not conform to the instructions will not be accepted. However, you do not need to achieve excellence or some other unrealistic standard to do well. You do need to try and to be willing to make mistakes; your classmates and I will be there to support you. I will provide feedback on your two projects and provide you an opportunity to revise them (if you submit them by the due date). </p><p>To earn more than 80 in the course, in addition to meeting the labour requirements outlined above, you should contribute meaningfully to the class. We all work, learn, and make decisions better when we are supported by and collaborate with others. There is no formula for how to engage meaningfully. Trust yourself and challenge yourself to enhance the experience of the class as a whole. This could range from contributions to class discussion, to sharing links, articles, references to sources outside course readings that enrich our understanding of our subject, touching base with other students in the course throughout the term, or providing feedback on their work. Maybe you form a discussion group. Whatever it is you do in this fashion will count towards your final grade. </p><p>I have been influenced by many people to challenge colonial structures of assessment, and I am grateful to my colleague Kevin Carey, from whom I adapted the language used above. </p><h3>Scenes for Consideration</h3><p>This assignment supports learning outcomes 1-4.</p><p>Over the course of the semester, you will complete five Scenes for Consideration, or SFCs for short. Each SFC will correspond to a particular reading assigned for the course. </p><p>In addition to being a means of note-taking, these assignments are intended to help you practice explaining philosophical ideas and articulating questions that you would like to think about with the help of everyone else. SFCs are personal reflections on the reading and do not require any outside research or prior knowledge. We will use them as the basis of class discussions. </p><p>We will use the Discussions tool through Learn to submit SFCs. They will be due 24 hours prior to the class period for which a text is assigned. Discussion topics can be accessed by clicking <strong>Connect</strong> and then <strong>Discussions</strong> on the course navigation bar. You can also access the weekly topic threads under the appropriate week's folder in the "Notes and SFCs" module by clicking <strong>Content </strong>on the course navigation bar. </p><p>Because there are multiple opportunities to submit SFCs, these assignments will not be accepted late. </p><p>Here is how SFCs are structured:</p><ol><li><strong>In one to three sentences, summarize a philosophical or conceptual issue presented within the assigned text. </strong>When more than one text is assigned for a class period, choose one of them to write an SFC about.</li><li><strong>Choose a scene that you want to discuss. </strong><ol><li>If writing about a short story, copy down a brief quotation<strong> </strong>(i.e., a few sentences), with a page number citation if possible, that captures the central issue you wish to ask about or discuss.</li><li>If writing about a film or television episode, briefly describe the scene you want to discuss and include an approximate time stamp. Your description of the scene should be concise yet thorough enough to motivate the connection with the issue you summarized.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Ask a question, explicitly connecting it with your scene and the philosophical issue you identified.</strong> Your question should enable the class to engage critically and constructively with the assigned text. SFCs raise questions about meaning--they are the kinds of questions that must be discussed and which cannot be answered by simply doing research online or finding out more information. There are lots of kinds of questions you might ask. You might ask about how the issue you identify plays out within the text we read, or you might ask a question about the applying the issue in a different (but relevant) context. You might articulate a question about what you find confusing, enraging, or helpful about the scene. These are just examples of what kinds of questions you might pose. The goal is to generate questions and help us approach philosophical dimensions of the texts.</li><li><strong>Provide a brief (one to three sentence) tentative answer to your question. </strong>You answer is an educated guess, and you may wish to cite another aspect of the reading or a previous class discussion to support it. It is okay if you are not one hundred percent convinced that your own answer is correct! That's why we have discussion.</li></ol><p>Notes:</p><ul><li>You can insert text into the discussion thread instead of attaching a document.</li><li>Throughout your SFCs, include page references/approximate time stamps to any material from course readings that you cite. (It's not always possible for readings that we do on websites). If you mention another source (for example, a reading from another class period), include a page number reference for it too.</li><li>You can engage with other people's SFC before and after class on the discussion board.</li><li>If I select your question for discussion in class, you should consider that to be a meaningful contribution!</li></ul><h3>Mid-Term Project</h3><p>This assignment supports learning outcomes 1-3.</p><p>The mid-term project focuses on explaining philosophical issues that arise in science fiction, or on using science fiction to raise philosophical questions.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will be discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions.</p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience.

However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.

Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details.
