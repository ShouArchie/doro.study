<p>Utilitarianism says that the right ethical action is the one that maximizes good consequences. Utilitarian decision-making is said to be a more rational and objective than appealing to ethical judgments, because ethical judgments may be culturally variable, based on feelings rather than logic, and arbitrary. But utilitarianism faces famous objections: its conclusions are seen as violating the requirements of justice and equity, as recommending lying and cheating, as entailing discrimination against people with disabilities, and as facilitating colonialism on the part of wealthier countries. This course will consider utilitarianism and its alternatives from theoretical, practical, and political perspectives. </p>

<p><strong>420:</strong></p><p>There are two mini-papers, one shorter version of a final paper, one longer version of a final paper, a presentation, a grade for attendance and participation, and a grade for a proposal/description for the final project.</p><p><strong>Attendance and participation: </strong>Since this is a seminar, attendance and participation are important. Attendance for students in Phil 420 is required; <strong>attending at least half the class meetings is required to pass the course.</strong> You may miss up to four class meetings in the term for any reason with no penalty. Attendance counts toward your attendance and participation grade. There are several other ways to participate in this class: you can participate in class discussion, or by contributing to discussion on LEARN, or by emailing or speaking with me personally. If you attend class regularly, that will earn a grade of 65 for participation. If you attend class regularly and participate in any of the various forms at least once per week, that will earn a grade at least in the 70s range. Attendance plus more frequent participation will raise your participation grade; less frequent attendance will lower it. I will post attendance and participation grades on LEARN at the end of term; if you don't agree with yours please email me and we can discuss it. Participation is worth 10% of your grade.</p><p>Obviously if you feel unwell you should stay home. I also know that students may encounter other obstacles to attending class -- talk to me about any problems that come up. Adjustments to the attendance and participation criteria above must be approved by the instructor.</p><p>Each week, each student is required to come up with a discussion question for class, submitted via the LEARN discussion board by Monday at noon (for Tue) or Wednesday at noon (for Thur)-- students will be in groups. If you are one of the people writing a short paper for that week, feel free to base the question on your paper. Discussion questions will not be graded, but failing to hand them in will count against your participation grade. I may invite you to read aloud or summarize your posted question so we can discuss it during class. After we have class, I encourage you to continue discussion on the LEARN discussion board -- by continuing to discuss questions we talked about in class, and by discussing questions we didn't get a chance to talk about during class</p><p><strong>Mini-papers: </strong>Twice during the term on assigned dates, you'll have to submit a 300-600-word mini-paper on one of the readings (there will be groups of students handing in papers on different days). This paper should examine critically some particular idea from one of the texts assigned for that day, and should have a thesis and argument. These will be graded out of 10 points. These must be submitted via the LEARN dropbox, in pdf or .doc format, before noon the day before the class for which they apply. Depending on how our discussions go, I may ask you to read or summarize your paper in class so we can discuss the ideas as a class.</p><p><strong>Proposal for final paper: </strong>You will also be required to hand in a description, outline, or annotated bibliography for the topic of your paper, due Monday February 26th.</p><p><strong>Final papers: </strong>There is one long final paper required, which should be around 3,000 words, due April 16th. There is is a shorter, first version of the paper required, which should be around 1,500-1,750 words. The shorter paper is due Monday, March 24 by 11:59 pm via the LEARN dropbox. The final paper is due Wednesday April 16th at 11:59 via the LEARN dropbox.</p><p><strong>Presentation: </strong>the presentation will be based on the content of the shorter version of your final paper. You may use slides, a handout, or whatever format you prefer -- we will discuss details in class.</p><p><strong>In-class tests</strong> will be a mix of question formats including multiple choice, short answer, and very short essay. Test 1 covers the first half of the course and test 2 the second half.</p><p><strong>Check Learn: </strong>I will use LEARN for announcements etc. so please check it at least once a day.</p><p><strong>320</strong></p><p>There are two papers, two in-class tests, and a grade for attendance and participation.</p><p><strong>Papers: </strong>Both papers should be 1200-1500 words and topics will be suggested but you will be encouraged to come up with your own framing for your thesis and argument. For the first paper, you have the option of handing in a rewrite based on my comments. If you choose to do this your new paper grade will be an average of the original and the rewrite; your grade will not go down if the new draft is worse, but improved grades require significant changes and not just small edits. For the second paper, I will write fewer comments; if you would like more feedback, don't hesitate to ask.</p><p>Paper assignments will ask you to write about your own ideas about a philosophical problem while engaging the texts and ideas we've encountered in class. The focus is on presenting an original argument. Of course, this means the ideas in your papers must be your own; we will talk more in class about how to ensure that the ideas you present as your own really are, and how to cite any outside sources you do use appropriately. We will also discuss in class the use of generative AI and how it can and should be used. If you have any questions at any time about academic honesty and what it requires, do not hesitate to ask. For help with writing, check out The Writing Centre on campus.</p><p><strong>Attendance and participation: </strong>For a course such as this, attendance and participation are important.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Late work</strong></p><p>Please submit your papers to LEARN before the deadline on the day they are due. Obviously, you should hand in your papers on time, but if you must be late, I will subtract three percentage points from your paper grade per day of lateness (e. g., a grade of 78% would become 75% if one day late). If you experience unexpected difficulties like illness or personal difficulties, please let me know; if you expect to miss a deadline or test, please let me know by email as soon as possible and preferably beforehand.</p><p><strong>Generative AI </strong></p><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Recommendations for how to cite GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI.</p><p><strong>Electronic Device Policy</strong></p><p>Laptops or mobile devices can support your learning in this class, but they can also be a source of distraction for you and other students around you. You are welcome to use your devices for course-related activities such as taking notes, researching lecture topics, collaborating on group projects, viewing documents in LEARN, and communicating with other students about the course material. You are not permitted to use these devices for any non-course-related activities. Please ask the instructor in advance if you wish to make an audio recording of class lecture material.</p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory">CAUT Guide to Acknowledging Traditional Territory</a>.</p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p><h4>Held-with courses</h4><p>Please note that a held-with course will only count in the average for the subject code under which it has been taken, unless it is cross-listed with the subject code of its’ held-with course. For example, if a CLAS/HIST held-with course is taken under the CLAS subject code then it will count only in the CLAS major average, not the HIST major average. A held-with course will also only count towards program and breadth requirements of the subject code under which it is taken, unless it is cross-listed with the subject code of its’ held-with course.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.

Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.

Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>

A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
