<p>Moral philosophy is the systematic attempt to provide an answer to what is perhaps the most important question of all: How should we live our lives?</p><p>The first three sections of the course use a combination of historical and contemporary texts to survey three of the major moral theories in the Western philosophical tradition: utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics. Each theory articulates a very different vision of the good life, of the nature and value of happiness, and of what makes an action or a person morally good. Discussing these three theories—their content, their implications, and their pros and cons—provides an excellent introduction to some of the main trends and debates in moral philosophy, both historically and in the present day.</p><p>In the final section of the course, we will take up a range of very different skeptical challenges to the project of moral philosophy as conceived in the tradition of the three dominant moral theories mentioned above. Does philosophical theorizing really help is with morality? How (if at all) are race and gender relevant to our moral thinking? Is morality really all that important, anyway? It is hoped that the skeptical challenges hinted at by such questions will encourage you to deepen your own critical engagement with the philosophical theories discussed in the course.</p><p>This course aims to realize two broad goals for every participating student: <strong>First,</strong> by learning about moral philosophy, it is hoped thay you reflect on some difficult and important ethical questions— questions that are of enormous importance to our lives. By the end of the course, you should find that ethical questions are more common, and more difficult to answer, than you did at the outset. <strong>Second</strong>, this course should equip you with a range of philosophical skills and concepts with which to navigate these ethical challenges, some of which will likely prove useful in studying topics other than ethics as well. These are very broad goals. In order to achieve them, it will be worth attending to several more specific learning objectives, which can be roughly grouped into three categories.<br/><br/>Some of the learning objectives are related to specific course content. The second category of learning objectives relates to general academic skills that apply in all of your courses. The final category of learning objectives has to do with your attitudes or dispositions toward moral questions.</p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.

A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.
