I live and work on the <a href="http://www.sixnations.ca/LandsResources/HaldProc.htm">Haldimand Tract</a>, land granted to the Six Nations in 1784, which includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Before settlers came to this land, the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabeg were bound through <a href="https://nandogikendan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/69b9f-23-2-simpson.pdf">Gdoo-naaganinaa</a>, which means “One Dish” in Anishinaabemowin.

The university as an institution was designed for white people like me. I am safe and comfortable within the university as a consequence of my white privilege. This is not true for Black, Indigenous, or other racialized people on campus. I am committed to challenging racist structures within the university.</li></ul><p>You are welcome to ask me about why I include these acknowledgements on my syllabus or suggest improvements I can make to wording or language. </p>

<h3>What to expect in class.</h3><p>In a nutshell, Gender Issues is about the social construction of gender and how gender norms impact our lives. This course will focus on philosophy, but will draw from other academic disciplines. It does not require prior familiarity with studying gender or philosophy. </p><p>Class time will involve a mixture of lecture, interpreting texts together, small group activities, and large class discussions. We will practice critical reading, respectful discussion with peers, evaluating philosophical arguments, and constructing our own arguments. </p><p>I will send updates to you between class sessions using the announcements function on Learn. I recommend checking Learn and your UWaterloo email regularly (e.g, every 48 hours).</p><p>In my experience, the following strategies, expressed by the acronym <i><strong>PREP</strong></i>,<i><strong> </strong></i>support learning and success when adopted by students:</p><ul><li><strong>P</strong>repare for class</li><li><strong>R</strong>eflect (cognitively, emotionally)</li><li><strong>E</strong>ngage (participate)</li><li><strong>P</strong>ractice patience and compassion (towards yourself and others)</li></ul><p>There is also a <i><strong>Unicorn sprinkles </strong></i>discussion topic on Learn where you can post event announcements, cute animal pictures, media recommendations, recipes, or anything that you want to share with the class. </p><h3>What we can expect of each other.</h3><p>I use an equity-centered, trauma-informed approach in my teaching practice that emphasizes safety, trust, peer support, collaboration, and empowerment. </p><p>Because of our unique perspectives, we each have something to offer the class. To make space for diverse perspectives, our classroom and online learning space should be respectful and accessible. Class discussion and disagreement are encouraged within the context of a respectful environment. Oppressive or hateful speech will not be tolerated. </p><p>Be aware that some topics may bring up painful experiences for some members of class (and we cannot always predict what these topics may be). I welcome feedback throughout the semester about how to promote accessibility. </p><h4>Supports</h4><p>There are links at the end of the course outline to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students">AccessAbility Services</a> and to the form where you can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">self-declare an illness</a>, which sends a message to your professors. In addition, at the end of this outline and through the Mental Health Widget on the Course Home page, you can find links to mental health supports on and off campus.</p><ul><li>If appropriate, you may also access support through student-run services, including <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/raise/">RAISE</a>, <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/glow/">GLOW</a>, the <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/womens-centre/">Women's Centre</a>, and <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/mates/">MATES</a>. </li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/stpauls/waterloo-indigenous-student-centre">Shatitsirótha’, the Waterloo Indigenous Student Centre</a>, supports Indigenous students. </li><li>The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/svpro">Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Office</a> (SVPRO) supports all members of the University of Waterloo campus community who have experienced, or been impacted, by sexual violence. SVPRO is guided by anti-oppressive, intersectional, trauma-informed, evidence-based and collaborative approaches. For a quick contact, email the SVPRO at <a href="mailto:svpro@uwaterloo.ca">svpro@uwaterloo.ca.</a> </li><li>There is also has an <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office/edi-r-intake-form">intake form</a> where members of the campus community can disclose harms and/or request support from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R).</li></ul><p> </p>

  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Explain how gender norms operate in society.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Identify ways in which constructions of disability, racialization, sex, and sexuality shape ideas about gender.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Receive and respond to critical dialogue, with texts and with each other, about the complexity of gender.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Summarize, evaluate, and create philosophical arguments.</td>

<p role="note">These learning goals represent what I want you to get out of the course. The final outcome will not be assessed formally, but is something I hope the course texts and our conversations will cultivate. But what about you? Does one learning goal stand out to you more than others? What are your personal learning goals for Gender Issues?</p>

<h3><strong>Labour</strong></h3><p>Learning is an act of labour and public accountability. In this course, grades will be based on labour. </p><p>Part of the labour of learning entails reading the assigned material and communicating your thoughts and feelings in class through speaking, writing, or some other medium. You will earn an 80 in the course if you do the following:</p><ul><li>Attend 80% of class meetings and complete 80% of the readings</li><li>Complete five 3-2-1 reflections (on time)</li><li>Regularly make substantive contributions to class</li><li>Complete the Essay and any revisions by the due dates</li><li>Complete the Proposal, the Five Critical Concepts Project, and any revisions by the due dates</li><li>Complete the Self-Assessment by the due date</li></ul><p>I have high expectations for your work. Assignments are expected to be thoughtful and thorough, and I will provide rubrics to outline expectations. Work that is incomplete or does not conform to the instructions will not be accepted. </p><p>However, you do not need to achieve excellence or some other unrealistic standard to do well. You do need to try and to be willing to make mistakes; your classmates and I will be there to support you. I will provide feedback on your two projects and provide you an opportunity to revise them (if you submit them by the due date). </p><p>To earn more than 80 in the course, in addition to meeting the labour requirements outlined above, you should contribute meaningfully to the class. We all work, learn, and make decisions better when we are supported by and collaborate with others. There is no formula for how to engage meaningfully. Trust yourself and challenge yourself to enhance the experience of the class as a whole. This could range from contributions to class discussion, to sharing links, articles, references to sources outside course readings that enrich our understanding of our subject, touching base with other students in the course throughout the term, or providing feedback on their work. Maybe you form a discussion group. Whatever it is you do in this fashion will count towards your final grade. </p><p>I have been influenced by many people to challenge colonial structures of assessment, and I am grateful to my colleague Kevin Carey, from whom I adapted the language used above. </p><h3>3-2-1 Reading Notes (3-2-1s)</h3><p>This assignment supports learning outcomes 1-4.</p><p>Over the course of the semester, you will complete five 3-2-1 Reading Notes. Each note will correspond to a particular reading assigned for the course. In addition to being a good way to structure your own note-taking, these assignments are intended to help you practice summarizing and evaluating arguments, as well as helping structure our class discussions.</p><p>The reflection has three parts:</p><ul><li>Make three points or statements of clarification about the texts. Each statement should only be one or two sentences. In other words, summarize important points about the author’s argument in a sentence or two for each point. Cite page number references for your summary points.</li><li>Copy down two quotes that you find to be significant for understanding the reading and provide a brief explanation (i.e., a couple sentences) for why you found these quotes striking/important. Include the page number citation with your quotation.</li><li>Articulate one discussion question. These questions should not be answerable with a “yes” or a “no,” but ask us to reflect on what the reading means or how we might apply it. A brief paragraph is sufficient.</li></ul><p>Sometimes it is tempting to write as much as possible. Don't do that for this assignment. Focus on being concise but thorough. </p><p>You can submit a 3-2-1 for any class period where we have an assigned reading. The 3-2-1 should be about the reading that is assigned for that class period. Post your 3-2-1 through the appropriate Learn discussion board for that reading by 10 a.m. the day of class. </p><p>Because there are many opportunities to submit 3-2-1s, I will not accept them late.</p><h4>Alternative 3-2-1s</h4><p>You may substitute up to two 3-2-1s by attending an <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/gender-social-justice/events/gsj-2024-2025-speaker-series">Urgency of Social Justice Speaker Series</a> talk and writing a 3-2-1 about it (instead of a class reading). Your quotations for this assignment will be paraphrased, and I understand that. </p><p>If you attend the January 17 talk, your 3-2-1 will be due January 24, 11:59 p.m. If you attend the February 7 talk, your 3-2-1 will be due February 14, 11:59 p.m.</p><h3>Essay</h3><p>This assignment supports learning outcomes 1-4.</p><p>You will write a 600-750 word argumentative philosophical analysis that responds to conversations taken up by the readings and our class discussions. No outside research will be required. There are three options for this assignment. </p><ul><li>Respond to a focused question from a list of options that I will provide.</li><li>Expand one of your discussion questions from a 3-2-1 Reading Note into an essay topic.</li><li>Choose your own topic (approved in advance by me).</li></ul><p>A detailed rubric will be provided on Learn. </p><p>On Monday February 24, class will be devoted to a peer review workshop. Bring a draft of your essay introduction to class in a format that can be shared. </p><p>Due Friday, February 28, 11:59 p.m. through the Learn drop box. There will be a no-penalty grace period for submission until Monday, March 3, 10 a.m. </p><h3>Five Critical Concepts Project</h3><p>This assignment supports learning outcomes 1-4. </p><p>In this project, you will choose five concepts about gender that we have read about and discussed in class that are important for how you understand gender. Drawing explicitly on course readings, you will write critical introductions to these concepts and explain why they are important for how you understand gender. This assignment will draw on course material and can be done without supplemental research. </p><p>You have options for how you present your critical concepts project. You may choose to format your project like an essay. If so, aim for between 1500-1750 words. Think about a page double spaced for each concept, and then a half-page to a page for the introduction and conclusion. </p><p>Alternatively, you might create a podcast, zine, series of poems, game, or something else that presents your five critical concepts. I can help you develop a project that meets the learning goals for the assignment. </p><p>The Five Critical Concepts Project will be due on Friday, April 4 by 11:59 p.m. through the Learn drop box.

<h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory">CAUT Guide to Acknowledging Traditional Territory</a>.</p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Cross-listed Courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p><h4>Generative AI Use</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will be discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions.</p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.
