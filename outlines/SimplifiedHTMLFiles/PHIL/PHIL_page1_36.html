  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>PHIL 319J:</div>
<p>What options does a person reaching the end of life have and how can they best be cared for? How can we balance patient autonomy with the expertise of the health-care provider and the demands of the health-care system? This course will help students think philosophically and critically about issues like these in their cultural, historical, and legal context. Specific topics may include consent, human dignity, euthanasia, refusal or withdrawal of treatment, palliative care and holistic patient care, pluralism and diverse understandings of dying, and treatment of the elderly.</p>

<h2>Detailed Breakdown of Course Requirements:</h2><h3>1. Participation (20%)</h3><ul><li><strong>Weekly In-Class Vevox Polls (10%) </strong><ul><li>Each lecture from week 2 to week 12 will include participation polls through Vevox (accessed through our Learn site). As a UW student, you have free access to Vevox. Participation in at least 75% of the polls for a given class will give you 1% toward your course grade. There will be 11 in total, and for full marks you need to get the participation point in at least 10 (this means you can afford to miss one of them).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Discussion Forum (5%)</strong><ul><li>Five times in the term (weeks 2, 3, 7, 10 and 12) I will create a discussion thread and put up a prompt in the Class Discussion Forum in Learn. Each thread will be available only during the associated week, from Tues 10am to Fri 11:54pm. Each time you participate in a thread by writing a post of your own and at least two comments on the posts of your peers you will earn 1.25% toward your course grade (up to 5% total). <i><strong>Nota bene:</strong></i> (a) <u>guidelines for posting and commenting must be followed</u> (see Learn); (b) <u>you can only access the topic/prompt for a given week after you have completed the weekly participation survey for that week</u>; (c) <u>do not confuse this forum with the Open Discussion Forum</u>, which is an ungraded open forum for the course.</li></ul></li><li><strong>In-Class Activities (5%)</strong><ul><li>In several weeks, the lecture period will include in-class activities. Successful participation in each of these will give you 1% toward your course grade, up to 5% total. </li></ul></li></ul><h3>2. Book Reflection Quizzes (20%)</h3><ul><li>Each of weeks 3, 4 and 5 will include a Book Reflection Quiz to be completed in Learn, worth 10% each. The two Reflection Quizzes with the highest grade will be counted toward your course grade (so if you complete all three, the lowest will be dropped).</li><li>For each Book Reflection Quiz, students will choose a story from their selected book (see Texts / Materials section), and answer several questions about the story, their response to the story, and the broader significance of the story within the text. </li><li>Quizzes will include short answer and longer answer questions.</li></ul><h3>3. Assisted Death Quizzes (30%)</h3><ul><li>Each of weeks 7, 8, 9 and 10 will include an Assisted Death Quiz to be completed in Learn, worth 10% each. The three Assisted Death Quizzes with the highest grade will be counted toward your course grade (so if you complete all four, the lowest will be dropped). </li><li>Each Assisted Death Quiz will cover a major aspect or angle of the debate over the ethical permissibility of "Medical Assistance in Dying" in Canada.</li><li>Quizzes will include a mix of true/false, multiple choice, short answer and longer answer questions.</li></ul><h3>4. Final Exam (30%)</h3><ul><li>The Final Exam for this course, to be scheduled by the registrar in the final exam period, will be cumulative, covering the entirety of the readings and lecture content for the whole term. The focus of the exam will be to consider ways in which end-of-life care can be improved, from an ethical point of view. The exam will contain a multiple-choice section and an essay question section.</li></ul><p> </p>
</div>
<a></a>
<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/"><u>website</u></a><u>.</u></p><h2>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h2><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33 -- Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6.</p><h2>Intellectual Property</h2><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for written permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  It is also forbidden to share the material listed above from a previous iteration of a course with a student presently enrolled in the course, unless you have the instructor’s written permission to do so.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h2>Generative AI statement</h2><p>In this course, students are expected to write any discussion forum posts, quizzes with written components, and exams using their own thoughts and reflections, rather than those produced by Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). GenAI trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Recommendations for how to cite GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. </p><p>If you use generative AI in producing course work, you must cite the results as you would cite any source external to yourself, and make it as clear as possible what material comes from the AI source(s), and what comes from you. Works submitted by students that can be shown to consist mainly (upwards of 50%) in material generated by AI (even if properly cited) will receive a grade of zero. Works that rely substantially (but less than 50%) on AI-generated material may receive substantial grade deductions. Works that make use of uncited AI sources will receive a grade of zero and will be reported to the St. Jerome’s University Associate Dean. The Point: My goal is to see what <i>you</i> know and what you can produce, not what an AI generator “knows” and can “do.”</p><p>Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI.</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h2>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name</h2><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name and pronouns by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name and pronouns listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts.</p><p>Students can add their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information"><u>Quest</u></a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank.</p><p> </p>
