  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>PHIL 215:</div>
<p>Study of ethical and moral issues that typically arise in professional and business activity. What responsibilities to society at large do people in such business and professional activities as teaching, engineering, planning, architecture, and accounting have? How far should professional autonomy extend?</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>This course is an introduction to professional and business ethics. Ethics, broadly speaking, is the branch of philosophy that seeks to analyze principles of conduct that govern human activity. We are (in part) economic animals who trade with each other in the hopes of making ourselves better off. And insofar as our actions affect the well-being of others, what we do falls under the purview of ethics. In the context of this course we will look specifically at ethical issues and principles of conduct that are relevant to professionals and business people. Topics include: fundamentals of moral and political theory, ethical decision-making, professional responsibility, corporate social responsibility, and equality, among other things.</p><p>Like many other courses in philosophy, this series of lectures, readings, and discussions will deal with a critical analysis of many and varied views regarding life, existence, values, religious belief, <i>etc.</i></p>

<h4>Territorial Acknowledgement: </h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system. The faculty and staff in Arts encourage students to seek out mental health support if they are needed.</p><p><strong>On Campus</strong></p><p><i><strong>Due to COVID-19 and campus closures, services are available only online or by phone.</strong></i></p><ul><li>Counselling Services:  <a href="mailto:counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca"><u>counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> / 519-888-4567 ext. 32655</li><li><a href="https://wusa.ca/services/uw-mates"><u>MATES</u></a>:  one-to-one peer support program offered by the Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) and Counselling Services</li></ul><p><strong>Off campus, 24/7</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://good2talk.ca/"><u>Good2Talk</u></a>:  Free confidential help line for post-secondary students.

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
