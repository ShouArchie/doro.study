<div>PHIL 110A:</div>

<div>
<p>This course will introduce students to the discipline of philosophy by examining a variety of central issues in metaphysics (theory of reality) and epistemology (theory of knowledge). Topics in metaphysics will include the question of God's existence, the issue of free-will and determinism, the relation between the mind and the body, and issues in individuation and identity (including personal identity). Topics in epistemology will include the debate between rationalism and empiricism, the problem of skepticism, our knowledge of the external world, the problem of induction and the nature of scientific reasoning. Students will be encouraged to react critically to the reading material and lecture content and to formulate their own arguments for supporting or opposing the views of the particular philosophers in focus.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>This course requires regular access to the course in LEARN. Your instructor will use this site for communicating important information concerning course matters, returning graded assignments, etc. A reliable internet connection and regular checking of the course in LEARN (at least twice a week) is therefore mandatory.</p><p><strong>Late Policy for Essay Assignments:</strong> Late submission of essay assignments will be penalized at the rate of 10% per day late. This policy will apply without exception unless a documented excuse of sufficient weight is provided. See the section on "Declaring Absences" below for information on exceptions due to extenuating circumstances and how to provide documentation for them.</p><p><strong>Late Policy for Midterm Take-Home Examination and Take-home Final Examination:</strong> Late submissions will ordinarily not be accepted. See the section on "Declaring Absences" below for information on exceptions due to extenuating circumstances and how to provide documentation for them.</p><p><strong>Note regarding AAS accommodation plans:</strong> Students entitled to accommodation through AccessAbility Services will need to submit a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/missed-course-component">Missed Course Component Form</a> in order to receive accommodation for any late assessments.</p><p><strong>Policy on Generative AI:</strong>  This course involves the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as critical thinking, textual analysis, evaluation of ideas and arguments, and academic writing. Since the assessments in this course are designed to evaluate your abilities with respect to these skills, <i><strong>the use use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools—for example, Chat GPT—at any stage in the production of content for submission on assessments is NOT permitted!</strong></i> Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/integrity-students">academic integrity</a>, including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).   </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of your work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance.

For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.

<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
