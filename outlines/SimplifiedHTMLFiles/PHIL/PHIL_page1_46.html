</h2>
<div>
<p>Please call me 'Jenny'.  I am originally American but lived for 24 years in the UK, where I became a citizen.  I arrived in Canada in 2019, but am still waiting to get permanent residency.  I have an invisible disability which means I sometimes need to dictate my writing, leading to entertaining typos.  I do research on philosophy of language, deception, racism, sexism, and conspiracy theories-- and the ways that these all interact. I recently published <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/dogwhistles-and-figleaves-9780192871756?cc=ca&amp;lang=en&amp;#">a book on racist and conspiracist speech</a>.  For more about me and my research, go <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/j3saul">here</a>.</p><p>Office Hours: I'll be in my office (Hagey Hall 331) every Wednesday 1-2 (unless I tell you otherwise!) and you should feel very free to drop by.  I'm also available at other times, including by zoom.  Send me an email if you'd like to meet!</p><p>Finally: Let me know if there is anything I can do to make this class more accessible for you.</p>

<p>This course introduces students to issues in feminist philosophy of language through close engagement with journal articles and chapters. There are four main topics: for each, we will begin with foundational work and then examine the many directions in which this work is taken over subsequent years.  </p><p>This is a seminar class: This is <i>not </i>a lecture class.  Everything will be highly participatory, and you will need to participate to do well in the course. You will also need to engage in close reading of the course texts, and we'll use Perusall to help you do that. Every week there will be two readings.  You MUST read one very closely, but you can choose to skim the other.  (Though if you do read it closely you will do even better!) However, you need to be ready to discuss the one you've skimmed with your classmates.  This will help to develop the skill of being a good discussion participant.</p><p>Note about assessment structure: The course is planned so that you can skip occasional assignments, without penalty.  This lets you choose to have a lighter week occasionally, without needing to ask permission. </p><p><strong>Also note: Some of the readings and discussions will be about things like violence, hatred, and many sorts of bigotry.   Bear in mind that your classmates and/or their loved ones are likely, between them, to have experienced all of these. But also bear in mind that many of us don't have much practice discussing these things, and we are all likely to make mistakes.</strong></p><p><strong>There will also be offensive terminology under discussion. Moreover, some readings will use terminology that was considered unproblematic at the time of writing, but which is now seen differently. Engaging with this literature is very important for understanding the history of the field, and for developing the important virtue of charitable reading-- trying to understand what the writer was </strong><i><strong>trying</strong></i><strong> to do, even across temporal and conceptual divides.</strong></p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>A NOTE ABOUT READINGS: For each week there are two fairly difficult chapters or articles. You are welcome to choose one as your main focus, to really read closely and wrestle with.  But you must still skim-read the other and be ready to discuss it with classmates.</p><p>January 9 <strong>No reading to be done in advance.  </strong>In class we'll work through a bit of early thought: Cameron, <i>Language, Sexism, and Misogyny</i> Chapter 5 “Making Changes: Can we Decontaminate Sexist Language?” [Note that this discusses many terms that are commonly considered offensive]</p><p><u>Topic 1 Hermeneutical Injustice</u></p><p>The term "hermeneutical injustice" was coined by Miranda Fricker, in the first reading below (from 2007), but the ideas have roots in the work of Black feminists like Patricia Hill Collins.  However, Fricker's conceptualization has been very important to the subsequent literature, of which we'll look at a couple of examples.</p><p>January 13: Submit 3 Perusall comments on your choice of Fricker or Medina, and one syllabus comment.</p><p>January 16: Submit QFC before class and be ready to discuss in class. You must present the QFC to get credit for it.</p><ul><li>Fricker, “Hermeneutical Injustice”</li><li>Medina, “Hermeneutical Injustice and Polyphonic Contextualism” excerpt: 207-220 only</li></ul><p>January 20: Submit 3 Perusall comments on your choice of Romdenh-Romluc or Boncompagni.</p><p>January 23: Submit QFC before class and be ready to discuss in class. You must present the QFC to get credit for it.</p><ul><li>Romdenh-Romluc, “Hermeneutical Injustice: Blood Sports and the English Defence League”</li><li>Boncompagni, “LGBTQ Identities and Hermeneutical Injustice at the Border”</li></ul><p><u>Topic 2: Gender Marking and Gender Neutrality</u></p><p>English-speaking feminist scholars and activists of the 1970s and 1980s were very concerned about the use of masculine terms like 'he' and 'man' as supposedly gender-neutral.  They also worried about the many ways that gender is marked in language.  But these concerns generally assumed only two genders, and the terms 'sex' and 'gender' were often used interchangeably.  These concerns have lived on, but they have been developed in far more complex ways, especially by trans philosophers.  We'll start with some of the original work, then look at more recent developments.</p><p>January 27: Submit 3 Perusall comments on your choice of Frye or Cameron.</p><p>January 30: Submit QFC before class and be ready to discuss in class. You must present the QFC to get credit for it.</p><ul><li>Frye, “Sexism” [Please note that this paper was first published in 1985.  Its terminology is in places very dated, as are some of its ideas.  But it's been enormously influential and contains some important stuff.]</li><li>Cameron, <i>Language, Sexism, and Misogyny,</i> Chapter  “Default Male: Sexism and Grammar”</li></ul><p>February 3: Submit 3 Perusall comments on your choice of Kapusta or Dembroff and Wodak.</p><p>February 6: Submit QFC before class and be ready to discuss in class. You must present the QFC to get credit for it.</p><ul><li>Kapusta, “Misgendering and its Moral Contestability"</li><li>Dembroff and Wodak, “He/She/They/Ze”</li></ul><p>February 10: Submit 3 Perusall comments on your choice of Hernandez or Rosola.</p><p>February 13: Submit QFC before class and be ready to discuss in class. You must present the QFC to get credit for it.</p><ul><li>Hernandez, "Gender Affirmation and Loving Attention"</li><li>Rosola, “Linguistic Hermeneutical Injustice”</li></ul><p>February 21 READING WEEK: NO CLASSES</p><p><u>Topic 3: Speech Acts and Power</u></p><p>In 1995, Rae Langton published one of the very first papers to connect feminism with philosophy of language.  She made use of JL Austin's theory of speech acts, developed in the 1950s, which was not at all concerned with feminism or politics.  Langton's paper was enormously influential, both in showing that one could use philosophy of language for feminist purposes, and in sparking anti-oppressive philosophers' interest in speech act theory.  Although her paper focused on pornography-- a major topic of feminist concern at that time-- the ideas are much more broadly applicable.  The first paper below is Langton's and a response to it by me.  The next two show some of that work applying speech acts has developed over the decades.</p><p>February 24: Submit 3 Perusall comments on your choice of Langton or Saul.</p><p>February 27: Submit QFC before class and be ready to discuss in class. You must present the QFC to get credit for it.  </p><ul><li>Langton, “Speech Acts and Unspeakable Acts”</li><li>Saul, "Pornography, Speech Acts, and Context"</li></ul><p>March 3: Submit 3 Perusall comments on your choice of Sullivan-Clarke or McKinney.</p><p>March 6: Submit QFC before class and be ready to discuss in class. You must present the QFC to get credit for it.</p><ul><li>Sullivan-Clarke, "Relations and How Decolonial Allies Acknowledge Land"</li><li>McKinney, “Extracted Speech”</li></ul><p><u>Topic 4: Sexual Communication</u></p><p>Feminists have long been concerned with sexual communication.  (Indeed, we see that in Langton's paper.) The Kitzinger paper below is a linguist's response to the idea that sexual assaults often result from women being insufficiently direct in their refusals.  The second is a feminist philosopher arguing that we should not just look at consent and refusal.  The final two papers build on this work by using philosophy of language to look more closely at consent, refusal, and communication.  (Fun fact: Madeleine Kenyon is a PhD student at the University of Waterloo right now!)</p><p>March 10: Submit 3 Perusall comments on your choice of Kitzinger or Kukla.</p><p>March 13: Submit QFC before class and be ready to discuss in class.

<h2><u>Perusall Comments</u></h2><p>Perusall is a tool that we'll use together for close reading. You're required to make AT LEAST 3 substantial comments to get full Perusall credit for a week (3 points).  You can choose to skip some weeks. (The exception to all this is the first week: there are no Perusall comments due in Week 1, but for week 2 you can submit both the normal comments and one syllabus comment.)  The maximum number of points you can earn is 19.</p><p>What kind of comment to write:</p><ul><li>Ask for clarification, being precise about what confuses you.</li><li>Raise an objection or concern.</li><li>Draw a connection with something else-- maybe in the same paper, maybe a different one, maybe something not in philosophy.</li><li>Suggest a response to a point the author makes.</li><li>Suggest a way of expanding a point.</li><li>ESPECIALLY USEFUL: respond to something a classmate has said.</li></ul><h2><u>Questions for Consideration (QFCs)-- an idea invented by Kate Norlock </u></h2><p>Each of these should be approximately 300 words, possibly exploring and expanding on a point from Perusall (yours or someone else's). The idea is to raise an interesting text-focused question that is worth having a discussion about, and to say at least little bit about you think the question might be answered. Then we'll discuss it! These are the things you should do, and each of them is worth 1 point, making each QFC worth 5 points. <strong>You will only earn credit for the QFC if you also present it in class.  And you must upload your QFC before class each Thursday.</strong>  Only your best 6 QFCs will count, yielding a maximum of 30 points.  </p><p>You'll be marked on how well you do the following:</p><ol><li>Reproduce a very brief excerpt from the reading that is particularly useful for explaining the question you are posing. As a default, use <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines">APA style.</a>  If you want to use a different style, just ask me.</li><li>Pose an open, searching question <i>related to the reading</i>. It should be a question to which you don’t know the answer, and which you want to investigate with your fellow students.</li><li>Write clearly.</li><li>Show good understanding of the reading.</li><li>Venture a tentative answer to the question.</li></ol><h2><u>Presentation</u></h2><p>In your presentation, you will explain what you are trying to do in your essay, and where you are getting stuck.  You'll ask for help from your classmates, and they will give you help.  You are welcome to use powerpoint or handout, but if you do please send them to me by 9 AM on the day of your presentation.  You'll be graded on:</p><ol><li>How clearly you present what you plan to do.</li><li>How well you explain what you are struggling with.  <strong>IMPORTANT: you must be specific about this. "So what do you think?" or "what should my argument be?" are not specific enough.</strong></li></ol><h2><u>Essay</u></h2><p><strong>Length</strong></p><ul><li>For undergraduates: 2500-4000 words</li><li>For graduate students: 5000-6000 words</li></ul><p><strong>Your essay must discuss a real-life example in light of one or more of the philosophical readings on this course.  Key elements on which you will be marked:</strong></p><ul><li>Accuracy about theory/concept you are discussing</li><li>Good independent thought about how the theory/concept applies to the case</li><li>Compelling argumentation</li><li>Clarity</li><li>Referencing (using <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines">APA style</a>, unless you've asked to use a different style).</li></ul><p><strong>If you want to do a different sort of essay, come talk to me-- we may be able to make it work.</strong></p><p>DRAFTS: If you'd like me to look at a draft, email it to me by 10 April.  </p><p>DUE DATE: 17 April</p><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3><strong>EXTENSIONS POLICY: </strong></h3><p>The course is set up very flexibly-- you can choose to skip an occasional assessment, or even a week, without penalty. There are no extensions available for QFCs , as they need to be done on time for the course to function. If you need an extension for something else, email me explaining how much time you think you need.</p><h3><strong>ATTENDANCE POLICY: </strong></h3><p>I will not take attendance, but to get credit for a QFC you must present it in class. If on some particular occasion you need to attend via Zoom (for example, if you test positive for Covid), send me an email and I will try to facilitate this.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p><strong>Short version: Do NOT use Generative AI.  </strong></p><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as clear expression of independent thought. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.
