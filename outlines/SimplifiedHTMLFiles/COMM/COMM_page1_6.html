<p><strong>Student Teams</strong></p><p>You will be randomly assigned to teams of 4-6 students in order to complete the team assigned portions of the course deliverables. These team assignments will be made online at the end of the first week of classes.  Your team will be assigned to one of the guest entrepreneur presentations and will be required to lead the class discussions that night and to provide a written reflection on the guest entrepreneur’s presentation (see below). Your team will also have a final group presentation on a topic of interest related to entrepreneurship that will be due at the end of the term (see below).</p><p><strong>Guest Entrepreneurs </strong></p><p>A primary component of this course will be Guest Entrepreneur presentations.  These will be conducted in class or via Teams during the scheduled Thursday 5PM sessions, as per the course schedule.  Since this is a major component of the learning process you are required to attend these sessions as they occur.  </p><p>The presentations will not be recorded. If we are hosting the speaker via Teams, the link will be posted in the Speaker's section of the LEARN page.</p><p>Each group will be assigned a Guest Entrepreneur. These groups have to prepare ahead of their session questions to ask. They will be preparing a report on that Guest Entrepreneur (Guest Entrepreneur Reflection). Major participation points will be marked for asking questions during these sessions with greater weight for the assigned group. Students whose groups were not assigned the Guest Entrepreneur will also be graded for their participation.</p><p><strong>Peer Evaluations</strong></p><p>Because 60% of your term mark will be rewarded in teams, you will be asked to provide a peer evaluation at the end of the course.  This will take the form of MS Forms announced by the end of the term.</p><p>If you are having challenges in your team, you MUST engage the instructors early to try to resolve those issues.  This is required if there are to be any reductions to individual team member grades.  Failure to do so may result in a penalty of 5-10% to the entire team.</p><p><strong>Guest Entrepreneur Group Reflection</strong></p><p>Your team will be responsible for submitting a reflection on your assigned guest entrepreneur.  This will be worth 30% of your mark for the course.  Additional details for the required reflection rubric will be provided separately on LEARN.</p><p><strong>TopHat Engagement </strong></p><p>You will receive an invite to the TopHat textbook for the course to your uwaterloo email address.  Please check your spam folder first, and if you are either new to registering for the course or you have not received the invite please email your instructors.</p><p>Throughout the term you will be assigned the fifteen (15) TopHat chapters for completion based on the online due dates in the TopHat platform which are also reflected in the detailed course schedule.  It will mainly be two chapters per week. Chapters are easy to follow and will take 1-3 hours/chapter on average. Each chapter typically includes five (5) or more assigned multiple choice questions and some occasional free form reflection questions.  There are unlimited attempts per question for the multiple choice (50% per participation and 50% for correctness) and the reflection questions are free form and are marked for completion only.  These must be submitted by the due dates on TopHat to get credit.  Your total TopHat engagement score across the 15 chapters will count for 15% of your term mark.</p><p>There is a separate set of free form questions asking for your feedback at the end of each chapter.  These are entirely voluntary and anonymous … and do NOT count towards your TopHat engagement score.  THERE IS NO MIDTERM or FINAL EXAMS FOR THE COURSE.</p><p><strong>Group Capstone Entrepreneurship Presentation </strong></p><p>Your team will be responsible for submitting a 30 minute presentation in class. This will be worth 30% of your term mark and will be scheduled later during the course. Additional details will be provided on LEARN.    THERE IS NO FINAL EXAM FOR THE COURSE.</p><p><strong>Class Participation</strong></p><p>Class participation marks will be assigned as follows: </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Participation</td><td>22%</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Speaker Sessions</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Your turn</td><td>12%</td><td>group</td><td>6%</td><td>individual</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Not your turn</td><td>5%</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Project presentations</td><td>3%</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Attendance</td><td>2%</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.<br/><br/>Turnitin.com: Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.<br/><br/>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
