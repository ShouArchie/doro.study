<p>VALUATION PROJECT: You will produce a valuation of a stock of your choosing worth a total of 20% of your final mark that includes an industry and competitor analysis, calculation of an appropriate discount rate, a relative valuation and a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation for an assigned stock.  You must discuss your company with the instructor so we can identify its appropriateness.</p><p>This is a group project.  Details of this project will be provided in the second week of the term.  If you wish, you will have the opportunity to complete a group member peer evaluation form that will be used to determine the final distribution of the marks for the project if you wish.  I encourage all members to communicate opening about workloads and expectations.  I am not a group councilor, but if you need me to intervene in group disputes I can do that. </p><p>ORAL PRESENTATION: A well-prepared presentation can be an uplifting experience.  A poorly prepared one can feel interminable.  Consider me to be a member of your groups.  This is a valuable part of your learning in the class and I am here to help you any way I can.  I can coach you as to how to make an effective argument.  I want this to be a useful and enriching part of this course. You will have 10 minutes to present a summary of your work and there will be 5 minutes for questions from the class.  You will have only 10 minutes so it will be a highlights reel of your work.  Details will come soon. This is worth 7% of your mark.</p><p>WRITTEN SUBMISSION: You will submit a 10 page written submission that summarizes your work you did during the term on your valuation project. Details will come soon.  This is worth 13% of your mark.</p><p>QUIZZES: There will be three (3) quizzes and they will all count in your final mark.  They will be held in class time and I will let you know the room they will be written in at closer to the first quiz date.  The quizzes are not cumulative and will cover the material from the previous quiz to the date indicated on the Excel sheet with the class schedule.</p><p>ETHICS: The FARM-CFA Specialization program is accredited though the CFA Institute (CFAI). As such, we are required to have a component in the program that deals with ethics and the standards of ethics of the CFAI. </p><p>Here is a link to the CFAI website: https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/ethics-standards/ethics/code-of-ethics-standards-of-conduct-guidance</p><p>The quizzes and final examination will test the material indicated in the schedule that is in the Standards and Practice Handbook of the CFAI. and will include a question pertaining to one of the CFAI Standards of Professional Conduct. Each quiz will have one short scenario that you need to address certain aspects of. Perhaps identifying the relevant code. Perhaps identifying a weakness in the analysis presented. Perhaps some other element will need addressing. This will be similar but more focused than the cases found in the casebook at the link provided.</p><p>Here is a link to a summary document of the Code of Conduct: https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/code/code-ethics-standards/code-of-ethics-standards-professional-conduct.ashx</p><p>Here is a link to the full handbook and a case book that provides more application of the code: https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/code/code-ethics-standards/standards-practice-handbook-11th-ed-eff-July-2014-corr-sept-2014.ashx</p><p>https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/ethics-in-practice/ethics-in-practice-casebook-2nd-edition-web.ashx</p><p>To be clear, you are not required to read the full Handbook or Casebook. I would understand the framework (summary document) and skim the relevant materials in the handbook. You can look over a few cases in the casebook with the analysis provided so that you can be prepared to make some appropriate observations on the quizzes and final examinations. This is not supposed to turn into am ethics class but rather introduce to you the idea of potential pitfalls in the investments field and the CFAI Code of Conduct.</p><p>FINAL EXAMINATION: The final exam is cumulative. You must receive a passing mark on the final examination to pass the class. It will be written on campus in a time slot determined by the Registrar’s Office. I have no control over when that happens.</p><p>If you do not pass the final exam, then the grade you will receive will be the lower of the calculated mark or your final examination mark.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
