<p>Situations involving risk are everywhere, including natural events such as storms and earthquakes, data breaches, corporate strategic initiatives, and everyday decision-making, where outcomes may be positive or negative. It is crucial to understand and effectively manage risk, rather than attempt to eliminate it. This course covers principles of risk management and insurance, including the identification of risk management problems, evaluation and implementation of various risk management tools such as insurance, emerging risks, and the various ways in which risk professionals, including actuaries, contribute. </p><p>This course aims to help students (i) develop an appreciation for the role of insurance and risk management in society, and the variety of opportunities for risk professionals to contribute, (ii) contextualize the quantitative tools in their future coursework, and (iii) practice critical thinking and communication skills in a domain knowledge setting.</p><h4>You need at least 60% in MTHEL 131 to declare Actuarial Science as a major.</h4><p>You can find the Actuarial Science program and plan requirements in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/home">Undergraduate Academic Calendar</a>.

<h4>Active learning and lecture participation</h4><p>Active participation is crucial for developing a strong understanding of course material and for applying concepts effectively.</p><p>This course aims to help you build the skills needed to apply what you learn. Lectures are designed to support this by providing:</p><ol><li>Opportunities to practice applying the material through individual and group polling questions, exercises, quizzes, and homework.</li><li>Time to ask questions and clarify concepts.</li></ol><p>While participation through in-class activities each week comprises 12% of the final grade, the main intent of these activities is to practice applying the concepts as a class (i.e., they are meant to be more formative than summative). Activities will be graded and returned within one week using <a href="https://crowdmark.com/">Crowdmark</a>, and the solutions will be discussed in class.</p><h4>Exam coverage will be announced one week before each exam.</h4><p>The material covered in each exam will be announced on <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home">LEARN</a> one week before each exam. The final exam covers all topics introduced in the course.</p><h4>Your exam seat will be assigned.</h4><p>Your seat location will be assigned a few days before each exam and can be found on <a href="https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/teaching/schedule">Odyssey</a>.</p><h4>You have one week to request an exam regrade.</h4><p>All exams will be graded within one week, and the solutions will be discussed in class. You will have one week to file a regrading request. Instructions on how to file a request will be posted on <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home">LEARN</a> with the return of each exam. The instructor/TA reserves the right to review the grading of your entire exam, and after the review, your resulting grade can be higher, lower, or stay the same. </p><h4>Requests for academic considerations due to absence</h4><p>If you experience a significant illness, ongoing medical condition, or other circumstances that prevent you from meeting academic obligations, please refer to the Faculty of Mathematics’ <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/absence-declarations">Absence Declarations</a> webpage for guidance on faculty policies. The weight of missed assessments due to approved declared absences will be shifted to the final exam.</p><p>Students who have been unable to engage with their courses for two weeks or longer, whether by illness or extenuating circumstances, should follow up with their individual instructors and their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/academic-advising">academic advisor</a> to assess whether maintaining their current course load is still viable.</p><p>For situations preventing you from completing the course, consult the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/incomplete-process">Faculty of Mathematics' INC process webpage </a>for more information. </p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
