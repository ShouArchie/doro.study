<div>
<div>
<div>PHARM 124:</div>
<p>This course, and PHARM125, consider the scientific and technical aspects important in dosage form design. The lectures and practical laboratory experiences emphasize the role of biopharmaceutics, preformulation, and physical pharmacy in the development of safe and effective dosage forms.</p>
<div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Pharmaceutics covers various aspects of how drugs are developed, how specific dosage forms are designed, manufactured, and extemporaneously compound in the pharmacy. The subject matter integrates the physical properties of the drug compound with the requirements of both the dosage form and the needs of the patient. Pharmacy 124 and 125 will discuss major dosage forms including solutions, colloidal systems, ointments, and solid dosage forms. Pharmacy 124 introduces the development of drug products, the design and preparation of dosage forms for drugs, especially solutions and dispersions (colloids, suspensions, emulsions). This course will discuss the physicochemical properties of drugs as they relate to the development of dosage forms and drug delivery systems. Students will also begin to develop their skills in dispensing prescriptions by (1) compounding drug products extemporaneously, (2) mastering pharmaceutical calculations, and (3) applying appropriate physical pharmacy principles.</p><p>This course is mostly delivered as in-person lectures or synchronous live streaming via Learn, additionally some content is delivered asynchronously via Learn. In-lab activities are all delivered in-person and involve hands-on compounding activities.</p>

<p>A passing grade for this course is 60%. Assignments that are not submitted on time will have 20% of the assignment grade deducted per day that it is late.</p><p>In certain circumstances, a supplemental exam will be offered to students who do not achieve a passing grade in this course. Students should familiarize themselves with the Doctor of Pharmacy Regulations in the Undergraduate Studies Calendar. As per the regulations, students will only be eligible for a supplemental exam if they have a maximum of one failed course in that academic term and if they are in satisfactory or better academic standing entering that term (except if the term is the 1A term, where this does not apply). In addition, a student’s eligibility to write a supplemental exam in this course, is based on the following criteria that must be fulfilled:</p><p> 1. The student must have achieved a grade of 50.0% or higher</p><p>2. The student has not previously failed the course</p><p>3. The student’s current term average, including the failed course grade, is at least 65%</p><p>4. The student did not fail the course as a result of a penalty for an academic offense</p><p>Students will be notified if they are eligible for a supplemental examination in this course by the Undergraduate Affairs Office after all course examinations for the term have been received and reviewed. The supplemental examination will be a comprehensive assessment of the material covered in the course and the format of the supplemental examination will not necessarily by the same as the format of the original examination. Student’s will be notified of the format upon being informed of their eligibility.</p><p>Group work accounts for 5% of the total mark.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Policies for Pharmacy Lab Courses</strong></p><p>Professional behaviour is expected at all times. Tardiness, cell phone use and engaging in non-lab related conversation are examples of non-professional behaviours that are not permitted in lab. Failure to follow these policies may result in a deduction of the professionalism grade</p><p><u>Lab Policies:</u></p><p>1.A lab coat must be worn at all times. Lab coats must be fully buttoned. Students are responsible for providing their own lab coats.</p><p>2.Safety gloves will be provided and must be worn during labs (unless instructed otherwise).</p><p>3.Eye protection must be worn at all times (unless instructed otherwise). Students are responsible for providing their own safety goggles or glasses.</p><p>4.Casual head apparel (e.g. baseball caps, toques, etc.) is not permitted.</p><p>5.Food and beverages are not permitted in lab.</p><p>6.Hair must be tied back. Certain labs may require that students wear a hair net.</p><p>7.Shoes with closed toes and heels must be worn in all labs. Bare feet, sandals, and high heel shoes are not permitted. Running shoes are strongly encouraged.</p><p>8.Personal electronic devices (cell phones, smart phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) are not permitted in lab. If there are extenuating circumstances that make the use of a personal electronic device necessary, prior approval from the lab instructor is required.</p><p>9.The use of photographic and video equipment is prohibited in the lab.</p><p>10.All students must complete <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/training/whmis-2015">University of Waterloo Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) </a>training before the first lab.</p><p>The<strong> teaching assistants</strong> and <strong>instructors</strong> are authorized to ask any individual not complying with lab policies to LEAVE the lab.</p><p> </p><p><u>Attendance:</u></p><p>Students are expected to attend all mandatory scheduled lab sessions and arrive on time. If a student is absent, the onus is on the student to notify the lab instructor before or immediately after the missed lab session. Students should follow the procedures outlined on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/current-pharmd-students/student-absence#:~:text=Students%20who%20have%20been%20absent,or%20labs%20is%20still%20viable.">Student Absences webpage</a>. If the opportunity to make-up the lab is available, the make-up activity may be the same as the original lab, may be of a different format (e.g. an oral test), or may be a combination of these. In any case, the final decision of if the lab will be made up, the make-up format and the date that it will be administered will rest solely with the lab instructor.</p><p>Labs will begin and end promptly as scheduled. Information provided at the start of lab will not be repeated for late students. A student must participate in the experiment to receive a grade for results or accompanying assignments. No additional time will be provided for the completion of lab activities and/or experiments beyond the scheduled lab time.</p><p><strong>Students will be considered absent after 20% of scheduled lab time has elapsed.</strong></p><p> </p><p><u>Lab Safety Accommodations</u></p><p>In order to support the health and safety of students, those who have a permanent, temporary, or suspected disability/medical condition or pregnancy that may affect their ability to safely participate in/complete labs, are expected to contact <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a> and/or their course instructor to ensure that appropriate accommodations and preparations have been considered.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Student Evaluation</strong></p><p>In this course, there are activities that are graded, assignments that are mandatory but not graded or events for which the students’ presence is mandatory. Students are reminded that they should view these activities with the same professionalism as they would a job. Attendance and participation is expected and non-attendance, lack of participation or non-completion of assignments will affect an individual student’s grade in this course.</p><p> </p><p>Students who need to be absent for mandatory course activities, or who believe that illness or personal circumstances will impact their academic studies in a course, should follow the procedures outlined on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/current-pharmd-students/student-absence#:~:text=Students%20who%20have%20been%20absent,or%20labs%20is%20still%20viable.">Student Absences webpage</a>. In all cases, students must contact the course coordinator for the course as well as <a href="mailto:pharmacy.advisor@uwaterloo.ca">pharmacy.advisor@uwaterloo.ca</a> before or within 24 hours of a mandatory activity to determine necessary accommodations. </p><p> </p><p>In the event that a student unavoidably misses a mandatory activity, a make-up activity may be scheduled for that student at the sole discretion of the course coordinator. In the case of a missed exam, a new exam may be administered. This new exam may be the same as the original exam, may be a different exam, may be of a different format (e.g. an oral test), or may be of a different mix of questions (e.g. the percentage of specific topics on the new exam may differ from the original). In any case, the final decision of the exam format and date that it will be administered will rest solely with the course coordinator. </p><p> </p><p>The course coordinator may also choose to accommodate the missed activity in other ways, such as by re-distributing the weight of the missed activity among other class activities. Again, this will be at the sole discretion of the course coordinator. </p><p> </p><p>Students must discuss the VIF-specified degree of incapacitation with their course coordinators so that their actions are not misinterpreted or viewed with suspicion. A “severe” incapacitation indicates students are unable to engage in any academic studies during the period indicated. <strong>If they attend classes/labs, submit assignments/reports or write tests/exams during this period, they are at risk of being accused of “misrepresentation”; an academic offence, which carries a severe penalty that includes suspension. </strong>A “moderate” incapacitation could trigger a similar allegation, if students claim to be well enough to participate in some tests, while too ill to participate in others. Thus, in these cases it is important that students discuss their degree of incapacitation with their course coordinators so that their actions appear credible.</p><p> </p><p>More information can be found on the School of Pharmacy’s “Student Absence” web page (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/current-pharmd-students/student-absence">https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/current-pharmd-students/student-absence</a>) and the Undergraduate Calendar: <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations</a><u>.</u></p><p> </p><p>Students may receive a grade of Incomplete (INC) in a course where the student has been unable to complete course work because of verifiable illness or extenuating circumstances. These students must contact the course coordinator to formally request an INC for the course. Course coordinators will clearly define the outstanding course element(s) to be completed and will specify the final date when all outstanding course element(s) are to be received for grading. The   onus is on the student to complete all outstanding course elements(s). An online INC Grade Form will then be submitted by the course coordinator no later than the grade submission deadline for the course. Failure to complete work by the deadline indicated will result in the INC grade being changed to FTC (failure to complete). The course will be weighted as a grade of 32 for purposes of calculating the student’s average.</p><p> </p><p>Students that wish to have an assignment or exam re-graded must submit a written request that details why it should be re-graded. This written request must be delivered to the course coordinator within one month (see Appendix B of Policy #70) of the date that the grade was available, and must contain supporting evidence (e.g. from literature, textbooks, or other sources). Students should note that grades may stay the same, be increased or be decreased after re-grading.</p><p> </p><p>Depending upon the request, the course coordinator may decide to re-grade the whole assignment or test, and not just the question that is being challenged. Students should not mark in any way assignments or tests that they think may warrant a re-examination. Only assignments and tests that are completed in indelible ink are eligible for re-grading.</p><p> </p><p>In accordance with University policy, all assessments will be retained for one year after term grades become official. After that time, they will be destroyed in compliance with the University’s confidential shredding procedures.</p><p> </p><p>Students will be given one opportunity, for a maximum time to be specified by the instructor, to review their midterm papers after they have been graded. Students will be given one opportunity, for a maximum time to be specified by the instructor, to review their final exam after course grades have been released, if they submit a written request to the course coordinator within a 6-month period. Requests to see exams for a second time will not be accommodated.

Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the course coordinator or TA or used by the course coordinator or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p> </p><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the course coordinator, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from a course coordinator, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. Doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the course coordinator if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to them (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.

They can help develop an individualized academic accommodation plan for all components of your academic career.</p><p> </p><p>The term ‘disability’ covers a broad range and degree of conditions that can be permanent, temporary, sporadic, and suspected, including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, learning disabilities, sensory disabilities, developmental disabilities, mental health disabilities, as well as disabling illnesses, medical conditions, and trauma. Rather than focusing on the diagnosis, AccessAbility Services focuses on the ‘functional limitations’ that are impacting your ability to participate in post-secondary studies.</p><p> </p><p>You can apply for academic accommodations as soon as you become aware of (or suspect) a disability, medical condition, and/or have experienced trauma that is impacting your academics. Students are required to register at the beginning of every term, even if they have received academic accommodations in the past.</p><p> </p><p>To begin the registration process, complete the online application (<a href="https://york.accessiblelearning.com/uwaterloo/">https://york.accessiblelearning.com/uwaterloo/</a>) and upload supporting documentation, if available. If you do not have documentation because you suspect that you have an undiagnosed and undocumented disability (e.g., a learning disability, ADHD, a mental health disability, and/or a disabling condition) you should also submit the “Suspected Disability Self-Assessment Form” (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/self-assessment">https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/self-assessment</a>).</p><p> </p><p>Once your application and supporting documentation (if applicable) has been reviewed, you will be invited to meet with an Accommodations Consultant to finalize your registration, and develop your individualized academic accommodation and support plan.</p><p> </p><p>Once you have an accommodation plan, you will request your accommodations from your eligibility plan, for each course, using an online system. AccessAbility Services will communicate your accommodation plan to your course instructors and your pharmacy academic advisors.</p><p> </p><p>Your pharmacy academic advisors will then contact you to arrange an appointment to offer support and discuss your accommodation plan and how it will be implemented.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Expectation of Academic Integrity</strong></p><p><strong><u>Academic Integrity</u></strong></p><p>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.
