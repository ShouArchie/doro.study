  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy

<div>
<p><strong>Student Evaluation</strong></p><p>In this course, there are activities that are graded, assignments that are mandatory but not graded or events for which the students’ presence is mandatory. Students are reminded that they should view these activities with the same professionalism as they would a job. Attendance and participation is expected and non-attendance, lack of participation or non-completion of assignments will affect an individual student's grade in this course.</p><p>A student will be excused for a mandatory activity only under exceptional and unforeseen circumstances. While it is not possible to list all such circumstances, examples include: death of an immediate family member; significant illness of a family member; serious personal illness or injury requiring medical attention. Please note that student travel plans are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time or altering assignment deadlines. Questions should be directed to <a href="mailto:pharmacy.advisor@uwaterloo.ca">pharmacy.advisor@uwaterloo.ca.</a></p><p>When students believe their illness will impact their academic studies in a course, they must contact the course coordinator for that course before or within 24 hours of a mandatory activity and submit a completed Verification of Illness (VIF) Form (available online: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services</a>) to <a href="mailto:pharmacy.advisor@uwaterloo.ca">pharmacy.advisor@uwaterloo.ca. </a>Students whose illness delays the submission of the VIF should communicate via email or phone to avoid delays or difficulties with accommodation decisions. When a VIF is registered all course coordinators will be notified by email.</p><p>In the event that a student unavoidably misses a mandatory activity, a make-up activity may be scheduled for that student at the sole discretion of the course coordinator. In the case of a missed exam, a new exam may be administered. This new exam may be the same as the original exam, may be a different exam, may be of a different format (e.g. an oral test), or may be of a different mix of questions (e.g. the percentage of specific topics on the new exam may differ from the original). In any case, the final decision of the exam format and date that it will be administered will rest solely with the course coordinator. </p><p>Students must discuss the VIF-specified degree of incapacitation with their course coordinators so that their actions are not misinterpreted or viewed with suspicion. A “severe” incapacitation indicates students are unable to engage in any academic studies during the period indicated. <strong>If they attend classes/labs, submit assignments/reports or write tests/exams during this period, they are at risk of being accused of “misrepresentation”; an academic offence, which carries a severe penalty that includes suspension. </strong>A “moderate” incapacitation could trigger a similar allegation, if students claim to be well enough to participate in some tests, while too ill to participate in others. Thus, in these cases it is important that students discuss their degree of incapacitation with their course coordinators so that their actions appear credible.</p><p>More information can be found on the School of Pharmacy’s “Student Absence” web page (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/current-pharmd-students/student-absence">https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/current-pharmd-students/student-absence</a>) and the Undergraduate Calendar: <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations</a>. </p><p>Students may receive a grade of Incomplete (INC) in a course where the student has been unable to complete course work because of verifiable illness or extenuating circumstances. These students must contact the course coordinator to formally request an INC for the course. Course coordinators will clearly define the outstanding course element(s) to be completed and will specify the final date when all outstanding course element(s) are to be received for grading. The   onus is on the student to complete all outstanding course elements(s). An online INC Grade Form will then be submitted by the course coordinator no later than the grade submission deadline for the course. Failure to complete work by the deadline indicated will result in the INC grade being changed to FTC (failure to complete). The course will be weighted as a grade of 32 for purposes of calculating the student’s average.</p><p>Students that wish to have an assignment or exam re-graded must submit a written request that details why it should be re-graded. This written request must be delivered to the course coordinator within one month (see Appendix B of Policy #70) of the date that the grade was available, and must contain supporting evidence (e.g. from literature, textbooks, or other sources). Students should note that grades may stay the same, be increased or be decreased after re-grading.</p><p>Depending upon the request, the course coordinator may decide to re-grade the whole assignment or test, and not just the question that is being challenged. Students should not mark in any way assignments or tests that they think may warrant a re-examination. Only assignments and tests that are completed in indelible ink are eligible for re-grading.</p><p>In accordance with University policy, all assessments will be retained for one year after term grades become official. After that time, they will be destroyed in compliance with the University’s confidential shredding procedures.</p><p>Students will be given one opportunity, for a maximum time to be specified by the instructor, to review their midterm papers after they have been graded. Students will be given one opportunity, for a maximum time to be specified by the instructor, to review their final exam after course grades have been released, if they submit a written request to the course coordinator within a 6-month period. Requests to see exams for a second time will not be accommodated. When viewing graded exams, students are not permitted to take notes, or have any electronic devices on their person.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Changes to Course Outline</strong></p><p>The topics addressed in this course, as well as the schedule of topics, may be revised as the course progresses. Any changes will be announced in class and posted on LEARN or on other online learning platforms. <strong>The assessment weights CANNOT be altered. </strong>There is one exception. When a student has been excused from completing a mandatory assessment (a midterm, for example), the decision about how and when this assessment will be completed is at the discretion of the course coordinator. In this instance, the coordinator may choose to alter assessment weights by re- allocating marks from a midterm to a final exam. See the Student Assessment section of this document for more information.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Remote Teaching and Learning: Student Notice of Recording</strong></p><p>Activities for this course may involve recording, in partial fulfillment of the course learning outcomes. You will receive notification of recording via at least one of the following mechanisms: within the Learning Management System (LEARN), a message from your course instructor, course syllabus/website, or other means. Some technologies may also  provide a recording indicator. Images, audio, text/chat messaging that have been recorded may be used and/or made available by the University to this course for the purpose of materials review and assessment.</p><p>Recordings will be managed according to the University records classification scheme, WatClass, and will be securely destroyed when no longer needed by the University. Your personal information is protected in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31">Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act,</a> as well as University policies and guidelines and may be subject to disclosure where required by law.</p><p>The University will use reasonable means to protect the security and confidentiality of the recorded information, but cannot provide a guarantee of such due to factors beyond the University’s control, such as recordings being forwarded, copied, intercepted, circulated, disclosed, or stored without the University’s knowledge or permission, or the introduction of malware into computer system which could potentially damage or disrupt the computer, networks, and security settings. The University is not responsible for connectivity/technical difficulties or loss of data associated with your hardware, software or Internet connection.</p><p>By engaging in course activities that involve recording, you are consenting to the use of your appearance, image, text/chat messaging, and voice and/or likeness in the manner and under the conditions specified herein. (In the case of a live stream event, if you choose not to have your image or audio recorded, you may <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-it-services/">disable the audio  and video functionality</a><u> </u>(see: <i>Student privacy during live events</i>). Instructions to participate using a pseudonym instead of your real name are included where the feature exists; however, you must disclose the pseudonym to your instructor in advance in order to facilitate class participation.) If you choose not to be recorded, this notice serves as confirmation of your understanding of this notice.</p><p>You are not permitted to disclose the link to/URL of an event or an event session recording or copies of recording   to anyone, for any reason. Recordings are available only to authorized individuals who have  been directly provided the above instructions/link for their use. Recordings for personal use, required to facilitate your learning and preparation of personal course/lecture notes, should not be shared with others without the permission of the instructor or event coordinator. Review the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external">University’s guidelines for faculty, staff and students entering relationships with external organizations offering access to course materials</a> for more information on your obligations with respect to keeping copies of course materials.

Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the course coordinator or TA or used by the course coordinator or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the course coordinator, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from a course coordinator, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. Doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the course coordinator if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to them (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Students with Disabilities</strong></p><p>AccessAbility Services (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/</a>) works with students who have a known or unknown disability, illness, or condition. They can help develop an individualized academic accommodation plan for all components of your academic career.</p><p>The term ‘disability’ covers a broad range and degree of conditions that can be permanent, temporary, sporadic, and suspected, including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, learning disabilities, sensory disabilities, developmental disabilities, mental health disabilities, as well as disabling illnesses, medical conditions, and trauma. Rather than focusing on the diagnosis, AccessAbility Services focuses on the ‘functional limitations’ that are impacting your ability to participate in post-secondary studies.</p><p>You can apply for academic accommodations as soon as you become aware of (or suspect) a disability, medical condition, and/or have experienced trauma that is impacting your academics. Students are required to register at the beginning of every term, even if they have received academic accommodations in the past.</p><p>To begin the registration process, complete the online application (<a href="https://york.accessiblelearning.com/uwaterloo/">https://york.accessiblelearning.com/uwaterloo/</a>) and upload supporting documentation, if available. If you do not have documentation because you suspect that you have an undiagnosed and undocumented disability (e.g., a learning disability, ADHD, a mental health disability, and/or a disabling condition) you should also submit the “Suspected Disability Self-Assessment Form” (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/self-assessment">https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/self-assessment</a>). </p><p>Once your application and supporting documentation (if applicable) has been reviewed, you will be invited to meet with an Accommodations Consultant to finalize your registration, and develop your individualized academic accommodation and support plan.</p><p>Once you have an accommodation plan, you will request your accommodations from your eligibility plan, for each course, using an online system. AccessAbility Services will communicate your accommodation plan to your course instructors and your pharmacy academic advisors.</p><p>Your pharmacy academic advisors will then contact you to arrange an appointment to offer support and discuss your accommodation plan and how it will be implemented.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Expectation of Academic Integrity</strong></p><p><strong><u>Academic Integrity</u></strong></p><p>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. Please refer to:  <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/Students/index.html.">http://www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/Students/index.html.</a></p><p>The Office of Academic Integrity has developed a tutorial that helps students recognize and avoid academic integrity offences (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/integrity-students/academic-integrity-101">https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/integrity-students/academic-integrity-101</a>). </p><p>Using another student’s Top Hat® account to help them receive participation marks is a breach of academic integrity. If you do so, all students involved will be subject to penalty. It is a breach of academic integrity to sign into a Seminar course for a classmate or to use another student’s Examplify account.</p><p>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students’ submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin® in this course.</p><p>Students are reminded that in accordance with University <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><i>Policy 71 – Student Discipline</i></a>, the "<i>obtaining, distributing, or receiving of any confidential academic material without the express consent of the instructor" </i>is considered an academic offence. As such, students should not procure, use, attempt to use or distribute any improper or unauthorized materials related to tests, including, but not limited to: test questions, copies of paper tests, test files of any type (electronic or non-electronic) and/or test passwords. Any intentional attempt to access the test outside of the scheduled test time, and/or disable or tamper with the test in any form, including, but not limited to: paper tests/ExamSoft/Examplify’s security features may be subject to the University’s academic discipline procedure.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Discipline</u></strong></p><p>Students are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offenses, and to take responsibility for their actions. Students who are unsure whether an action constitutes an offense, or who need help in learning how to avoid offenses (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about ‘rules’ for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course coordinator, academic advisor, or the Associate Dean of Science for Undergraduate Studies. For information on categories of offenses and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy #71, Student Discipline <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71</a>. For information on typical penalties, students should check Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties</a>. </p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Appeals</u></strong></p><p>A decision or penalty imposed under Policy #33 (Ethical Behaviour), Policy #70 (Student Petitions and Grievances) or Policy #71 (Student Discipline) may be appealed, if there is a ground. Students, who believe they have a ground for an appeal, should refer to Policy #72 (Student Appeals) <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72</a><a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy72.htm.">.</a></p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Student Grievances</u></strong></p><p>Grievance: A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read Policy #70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4 (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70</a>).

<p><strong>Use of Generative AI </strong></p><p><strong>Unless otherwise explicitly indicated in activity instructions</strong>, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</a></p><p><strong>If there are activities that explicitly state that GenAI may be used in this course</strong>, they must be accompanied with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement.  In these instances, permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will be discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai">https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
