  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>PHARM 657:</div>
<p>Mental health and addictions work is often carried out in specialized settings, focused on pathological substance use and use disorder. Addictions research is also almost entirely dedicated to substance use disorder and treatment. This course if focused on understanding substance use and addiction in community-based settings that are not necessarily addictions-focused. This course focuses on substance use in any form and how it affects health, public health, disease progression, and pharmaceutical care including drug interactions. We identify traditional and emerging types of research and information, including data from non-medical research sources and the grey literature. Community engagement and how to effectively educate policy makers, decision makers, stakeholders, service providers, and the public will be explored. Drug and drug classes covered include opioids, methamphetamine, cocaine, prescription and other stimulants, GABAergic drugs, serotonergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic hallucinogens, entactogens, alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis.</p>

<p>Assignment rubrics and details will be posted on LEARN.</p><p>A minimum of 70% must be obtained in any graduate course taken by a Pharmacy graduate student to be granted pass standing, and the candidate must obtain an average of at least 75% in the courses presented in fulfillment of any graduate level degree in Pharmacy. (Students from other departments/faculties should contact their graduate coordinator for requirements in their home department/faculty).</p><p>A supplemental exam will not be offered to students who do not achieve a passing grade in this course.</p><p>Late submission will not be accepted without valid and verified excuse. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/accommodation-due-to-illness">Accommodations</a> will be made for missed assignments due to illness ONLY with a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/sites/ca.campus-wellness/files/uploads/files/VIF-online.pdf">Verification of Illness form</a> or other documentation. Students should obtain documentation from <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/sites/ca.campus-wellness/files/uploads/files/VIF-online.pdf">Campus Wellness</a> services, if possible. </p><p>A student will be excused for a mandatory activity only under exceptional and unforeseen circumstances. While it is not possible to list all such circumstances, examples include: death of an immediate family member; significant illness of a family member; serious personal illness or injury requiring medical attention. Please note that student travel plans are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time or altering assignment deadlines.</p><p>If an event is missed due to illness, students must complete a Verification of Illness form, present it to the Pharmacy Graduate Office for verification and bring the certified copy to the course coordinator. In the event that a student unavoidably misses a mandatory activity, a make-up activity will be scheduled for that student at the sole discretion of the coordinator. In the case of a missed exam, a new exam may be administered. This new exam may be the same as the original exam, may be a different exam, may be of a different format (e.g. an oral test), or may be of a different mix of questions (e.g. the percentage of specific topics on the new exam may differ from the original). In any case, the final decision of which exam format and date that it will be administered will rest solely with the course coordinator. </p><p>In the event that a student is experiencing ongoing illness that prevents them from completing requirements, they should seek assistance through campus wellness, </p><p>Students that wish to have an assignment or exam re-graded must submit a written request that details why it should be re-graded. This written request must be delivered to the instructor within one month (see Appendix B of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70</a>) of the date that grade was available, and must contain supporting evidence (e.g. from literature, textbooks, or other sources). Students should note that grades may stay the same, be increased or be decreased after re-grading.  Depending upon the request, the instructor may decide to regrade the whole assignment or test, and not just the question that is being challenged.</p><p>Students should not mark in any way assignments or tests that they think may warrant a re-examination. Only assignments and tests that are completed in indelible ink are eligible for re-grading.</p><p>Unclaimed assignments, reports and tests will be retained for 1 year after term grades become official. After that time, they will be destroyed in compliance with UW’s confidential shredding procedures.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<p><strong>Use of Generative AI </strong></p><p><strong>Unless otherwise explicitly indicated in activity instructions</strong>, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
