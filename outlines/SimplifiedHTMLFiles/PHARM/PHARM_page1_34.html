<div>
<p>Through the Seminar Series of courses students are exposed to a number of speakers who address relevant topics within a content area. Speakers may include subject-matter experts, patients, and health care professionals.</p><p>The courses run for 50 minutes in each week of a 12-week term. Attendance and participation in weekly sessions is mandatory. The majority of seminar sessions will be in-person, synchronous lectures with the exception of the Speed Networking Event, which takes place outside of the usual seminar class time utilizing a small group rotating discussion format. The goal is to offer a variety of different perspectives on topics within an area of focus.</p><p>PHARM 391, Seminars in Pharmacy 2, will focus on student leadership development (SLD). This series serves as the learning environment where students will begin to understand several key concepts in leading change and establish a foundation in core leadership skills. Students will engage in classroom and self-directed learning activities that facilitate self-awareness and their growth as individual leaders. This course acknowledges the personal and continuous nature of leadership development, therefore the intent of the series is exposure to a variety of topics and thought leaders for future application in experiential, extracurricular, and on-the-job training in leadership.</p><p>Leadership skills are considered a core competency for all pharmacists to enhance pharmacy practice and health care. At the University of Waterloo, the School of Pharmacy’s vision is to lead change for a healthier world. With a goal to graduate pharmacists who are innovative change agents that can engage with others to optimize the safety, effectiveness and efficiency of health care and contribute to a vision of a high-quality health care system.</p><p>This seminar series has been designed with the 12 guiding principles of SLD in pharmacy in mind:</p><ol><li>Leadership is important for all student pharmacists</li><li>Leadership can be learned</li><li>SLD must focus on student self-development</li><li>Leadership development should take place in a wide variety of settings</li><li>Leadership development requires many teachers from whom students can learn</li><li>A person’s leadership development is continuous</li><li>Anyone has the potential to lead regardless of background, position, or title</li><li>Leadership is a choice</li><li>Leadership is principle-based and rooted in the common good</li><li>Leadership involves relationships with people</li><li>There is no single right way to lead</li><li>Leadership and management are distinct activities</li></ol><p> </p>

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted in a legally binding treaty to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Indigenous Initiatives Office</a>.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Student Evaluation</strong></p><p>In this course, there are activities that are graded, assignments that are mandatory but not graded or events for which the students’ presence is mandatory. Students are reminded that they should view these activities with the same professionalism as they would a job. Attendance and participation is expected and non-attendance, lack of participation or non-completion of assignments will affect an individual student's grade in this course.</p><p> </p><p>Students who need to be absent for mandatory course activities, or who believe that illness or personal circumstances will impact their academic studies in a course, should follow the procedures outlined on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/current-pharmd-students/student-absence">Student Absences webpage</a>. In all cases, students must contact the course coordinator for the course as well as <a href="mailto:pharmacy.advisor@uwaterloo.ca">pharmacy.advisor@uwaterloo.ca</a> before or within 24 hours of a mandatory activity to determine necessary accommodations. </p><p> </p><p>In the event that a student unavoidably misses a mandatory activity, a make-up activity may be scheduled for that student at the sole discretion of the course coordinator. In the case of a missed exam, a new exam may be administered. This new exam may be the same as the original exam, may be a different exam, may be of a different format (e.g. an oral test), or may be of a different mix of questions (e.g. the percentage of specific topics on the new exam may differ from the original). In any case, the final decision of the exam format and date that it will be administered will rest solely with the course coordinator. </p><p> </p><p>The course coordinator may also choose to accommodate the missed activity in other ways, such as by re-distributing the weight of the missed activity among other class activities. Again, this will be at the sole discretion of the course coordinator. </p><p> </p><p>Students must discuss the VIF-specified degree of incapacitation with their course coordinators so that their actions are not misinterpreted or viewed with suspicion. A “severe” incapacitation indicates students are unable to engage in any academic studies during the period indicated. <strong>If they attend classes/labs, submit assignments/reports or write tests/exams during this period, they are at risk of being accused of “misrepresentation”; an academic offence, which carries a severe penalty that includes suspension. </strong>A “moderate” incapacitation could trigger a similar allegation, if students claim to be well enough to participate in some tests, while too ill to participate in others. Thus, in these cases it is important that students discuss their degree of incapacitation with their course coordinators so that their actions appear credible.</p><p> </p><p>More information can be found on the School of Pharmacy’s “Student Absence” web page (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/current-pharmd-students/student-absence">https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/current-pharmd-students/student-absence</a>) and the Undergraduate Calendar: <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations</a>. </p><p> </p><p>Students may receive a grade of No Grade (NG) in a course where the student has been unable to complete course work because of verifiable illness or extenuating circumstances. These students must contact the course coordinator to formally request a NG for the course. Course coordinators will clearly define the outstanding course element(s) to be completed and will specify the final date when all outstanding course element(s) are to be received for grading. The onus is on the student to complete all outstanding course elements(s). Once the course element(s) have been completed, the course instructor will submit a grade change form to change the grade to Credit (CR).</p><p> </p><p>Students that wish to have an assignment or exam re-graded must submit a written request that details why it should be re-graded. This written request must be delivered to the course coordinator within one month (see Appendix B of Policy #70) of the date that the grade was available, and must contain supporting evidence (e.g. from literature, textbooks, or other sources). Students should note that grades may stay the same, be increased or be decreased after re-grading.</p><p> </p><p>Depending upon the request, the course coordinator may decide to re-grade the whole assignment or test, and not just the question that is being challenged. Students should not mark in any way assignments or tests that they think may warrant a re-examination. Only assignments and tests that are completed in indelible ink are eligible for re-grading.</p><p> </p><p>In accordance with University policy, all assessments will be retained for one year after term grades become official. After that time, they will be destroyed in compliance with the University’s confidential shredding procedures.</p><p> </p><p>Students will be given one opportunity, for a maximum time to be specified by the instructor, to review their midterm papers after they have been graded. Students will be given one opportunity, for a maximum time to be specified by the instructor, to review their final exam after course grades have been released, if they submit a written request to the course coordinator within a 6-month period. Requests to see exams for a second time will not be accommodated. When viewing graded exams, students are not permitted to take notes, or have any electronic devices on their person.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Changes to Course Outline</strong></p><p>The topics addressed in this course, as well as the schedule of topics, may be revised as the course progresses. Any changes will be announced in class and posted on LEARN or on other online learning platforms. <strong>The assessment weights CANNOT be altered. </strong>There is one exception. When a student has been excused from completing a mandatory assessment (a midterm, for example), the decision about how and when this assessment will be completed is at the discretion of the course coordinator. In this instance, the coordinator may choose to alter assessment weights by re- allocating marks from a midterm to a final exam. See the Student Assessment section of this document for more information.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Remote Teaching and Learning: Student Notice of Recording</strong></p><p>Activities for this course may involve recording, in partial fulfillment of the course learning outcomes. You will receive notification of recording via at least one of the following mechanisms: within the Learning Management System (LEARN), a message from your course instructor, course syllabus/website, or other means. Some technologies may also  provide a recording indicator. Images, audio, text/chat messaging that have been recorded may be used and/or made available by the University to this course for the purpose of materials review and assessment.</p><p> </p><p>Recordings will be managed according to the University records classification scheme, WatClass, and will be securely destroyed when no longer needed by the University. Your personal information is protected in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31">Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act,</a> as well as University policies and guidelines and may be subject to disclosure where required by law.</p><p> </p><p>The University will use reasonable means to protect the security and confidentiality of the recorded information, but cannot provide a guarantee of such due to factors beyond the University’s control, such as recordings being forwarded, copied, intercepted, circulated, disclosed, or stored without the University’s knowledge or permission, or the introduction of malware into computer system which could potentially damage or disrupt the computer, networks, and security settings. The University is not responsible for connectivity/technical difficulties or loss of data associated with your hardware, software or Internet connection.</p><p> </p><p>By engaging in course activities that involve recording, you are consenting to the use of your appearance, image, text/chat messaging, and voice and/or likeness in the manner and under the conditions specified herein. (In the case of a live stream event, if you choose not to have your image or audio recorded, you may <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-it-services/">disable the audio  and video functionality</a><u> </u>(see: <i>Student privacy during live events</i>). Instructions to participate using a pseudonym instead of your real name are included where the feature exists; however, you must disclose the pseudonym to your instructor in advance in order to facilitate class participation.) If you choose not to be recorded, this notice serves as confirmation of your understanding of this notice.</p><p> </p><p>You are not permitted to disclose the link to/URL of an event or an event session recording or copies of recording   to anyone, for any reason. Recordings are available only to authorized individuals who have  been directly provided the above instructions/link for their use. Recordings for personal use, required to facilitate your learning and preparation of personal course/lecture notes, should not be shared with others without the permission of the instructor or event coordinator. Review the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external">University’s guidelines for faculty, staff and students entering relationships with external organizations offering access to course materials</a> for more information on your obligations with respect to keeping copies of course materials.

Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the course coordinator or TA or used by the course coordinator or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p> </p><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the course coordinator, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p> </p><p>Permission from a course coordinator, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. Doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p> </p><p>Please alert the course coordinator if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to them (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Students with Disabilities</strong></p><p>AccessAbility Services (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/</a>) works with students who have a known or unknown disability, illness, or condition. They can help develop an individualized academic accommodation plan for all components of your academic career.</p><p> </p><p>The term ‘disability’ covers a broad range and degree of conditions that can be permanent, temporary, sporadic, and suspected, including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, learning disabilities, sensory disabilities, developmental disabilities, mental health disabilities, as well as disabling illnesses, medical conditions, and trauma. Rather than focusing on the diagnosis, AccessAbility Services focuses on the ‘functional limitations’ that are impacting your ability to participate in post-secondary studies.</p><p> </p><p>You can apply for academic accommodations as soon as you become aware of (or suspect) a disability, medical condition, and/or have experienced trauma that is impacting your academics. Students are required to register at the beginning of every term, even if they have received academic accommodations in the past.</p><p> </p><p>To begin the registration process, complete the online application (<a href="https://york.accessiblelearning.com/uwaterloo/">https://york.accessiblelearning.com/uwaterloo/</a>) and upload supporting documentation, if available.

Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.
