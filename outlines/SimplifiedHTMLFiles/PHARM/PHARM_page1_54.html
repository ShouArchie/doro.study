<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>PHARM 609:</div>
<p>This course provides statistical hands-on knowledge for the implementation of nonlinear mixed effects (NLME) models in the analysis of population pharmacokinetic data. In order to provide a foundation for NLME, the content builds from simple to multiple linear regression models and to linear mixed effects models. Exploratory and descriptive analyses as well as model implementation will be taught in R and Phoenix.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
</p>
<a></a>
<h2>
  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>Lectures and tutorials may be audio or video recorded only if permission is granted by the lecturer. Any recordings as well as other class materials (either posted in LEARN or distributed in class) are to be used for review purposes only and should not be posted on websites, bulletin boards or distributed via other means without permission of the Course Coordinator and the lecturer if other than the Course Coordinator.</p>
</div>
<a></a>
<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>A student will be excused from a mandatory activity only under exceptional and unforeseen circumstances. While it is not possible to list all such circumstances, examples include: death of an immediate family member; significant illness of a family member; serious personal illness or injury requiring medical attention. Please note that student travel plans are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time or altering assignment deadlines.</p><p>If an event is missed due to illness, students must complete a Verification of Illness (VIF) form (available online  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/health-services/sites/ca.health-services/files/uploads/files/VIF-online.pdf">https://uwaterloo.ca/health-services/sites/ca.health-services/files/uploads/files/VIF-online.pdf</a>) and present it to the Pharmacy Undergraduate office. Instructors will then be notified by email that a VIF has been received.  In the event that a student unavoidably misses a mandatory activity, a make-up activity will be scheduled for that student at the sole discretion of the coordinator. In the case of a missed exam, a new exam may be administered. This new exam may be the same as the original exam, may be a different exam, may be of a different format (e.g. an oral test), or may be of a different mix of questions (e.g. the percentage of specific topics on the new exam may differ from the original). In any case, the final decision of which exam format and date that it will be administered will rest solely with the course coordinator.</p><p>Students may receive a grade of Incomplete (INC) in a course where the student has been unable to complete course work because of verifiable illness or extenuating circumstances.  These students must complete an Incomplete (Inc) Grade Agreement Form.  The Incomplete Grade Agreement Form is an agreement between the instructor and student and specifies how and by what date course work will be completed.   Failure to complete work by the deadline indicated will result in the INC grade being changed to FTC (failure to complete).  The course will be weighted as a grade of 32 for purposes of calculating the student’s average.  A link to the Incomplete Grade Agreement Form follows.    <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/sites/ca.science/files/uploads/files/incomplete-grade-agreement-form.pdf">https://uwaterloo.ca/science/sites/ca.science/files/uploads/files/incomplete-grade-agreement-form.pdf</a>  </p><p>Students that wish to have an assignment or exam re-graded must submit a written request that details why it should be re-graded. This written request must be delivered to the instructor within one month (see Appendix B of Policy 70) of the date that grade was available, and must contain supporting evidence (e.g. from literature, textbooks, or other sources). Students should note that grades may stay the same, be increased or be decreased after re-grading.  Depending upon the request, the instructor may decide to re-grade the whole assignment or test, and not just the question that is being challenged. Students should not mark in any way assignments or tests that they think may warrant a re-examination. Only assignments and tests that are completed in indelible ink are eligible for re-grading.</p><p>Unclaimed assignments, reports and tests will be retained for 1 year  after term grades become official.  After that time, they will be destroyed in compliance with UW’s <u>confidential shredding procedures.</u><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Note: Final Exams will be retained for one year from the date the examination was written.</strong></p>

<div>
<p><strong>Use of Generative AI </strong></p><p><strong>Unless otherwise explicitly indicated in activity instructions</strong>, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</a></p><p><strong>If there are activities that explicitly state that GenAI may be used in this course</strong>, they must be accompanied with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement.  In these instances, permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will be discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai">https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
