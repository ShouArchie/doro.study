<div>
<p>PHARM 440 is one of three mandatory 4th year eight-week Patient Care Rotation courses where students provide direct patient care in one each of a primary care, institutional and elective (primary care or institutional or specialty clinic) setting. Students will be assigned to one of 14 geographic regions in Ontario and will have all of their rotations in that region’s community of practice (interconnected pharmacy practice and health care sites). For PHARM 440, students will be assigned to an institutional setting - which is defined as hospital inpatient pharmacies, long-term care facilities, correctional facilities, or group homes.</p><p><u>Requisites</u></p><p>Pharmacy students only. Students must have successfully completed all courses to the end of the 3B academic term, three co-op work terms, and the Community Service Learning (CSL) Milestone to enrol in this course. Additionally, students are required to provide evidence of completion of the following pre-rotation requirements to the School of Pharmacy prior to their first Patient Care Rotation.</p><p>Documents and forms are to be uploaded/completed on the School of Pharmacy’s experiential software system – CORE ELMS: CPR/First Aid Certificate, N95 Mask Fit, Certificate Immunization form(s) as required by the School of Pharmacy, consent to release (online form), and WSIB Student Declaration of Understanding.</p><p>If required by practice site: Influenza and/or other immunizations, Police records check, and any further requirements specific to the practice site.</p><p><u>Clinical practice refresh</u></p><p>If a student has had an interruption in their academic progression of greater than 4 months (1 term) during 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> year, the student will be required to complete return-to-practice readiness as assigned by the course instructor.</p><p>This includes, but is not limited to, students who may have been unsuccessful in a 3<sup>rd</sup> year course and return to complete a single course in 3B and those students who require a break during the 4A-4B rotation period. Completion of the return-to-practice readiness assignments is a requirement, and in the event of an INC, the requirement will be communicated as a condition of resuming rotations. </p>

<h2>
  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>N/A</p><h2><strong>Course Topics</strong></h2><p>The course consists of three major components:</p><h4><strong>1. Clinical Practice</strong>: </h4><p>Each student is guided and assessed by a primary preceptor while providing direct patient care. Students will interview and assess patients, identify drug related needs, review alternatives, develop and implement care plans which address actual or potential health concerns, and collaborate with interprofessional colleagues to improve patient health outcomes.</p><p><strong>Two possible models for the rotation exist:</strong></p><p><strong><u>8-week (standard rotation)</u></strong></p><p>Students will fulfil the clinical practice objectives at a single site, working a minimum of 40 hours per week for the 8- week placement – with the exception of statutory holidays.</p><p><strong><u>16-week (two concurrent course rotations)</u></strong></p><p>If a valuable practice experience is presented, e.g., a family health team which cannot accommodate a student on a full time basis, two part-time placements can be undertaken at the same time. This would require the enrolment into two separate Patient Care Rotation courses at the same time. In this scenario, two rotations will run concurrently. Expectations with respect to working a minimum 40 hours per week will be maintained. The detailed schedule will be provided by the practice sites in collaboration with the Regional Clinical Coordinator (RCC) and/ or EC.</p><p><strong><u>NOTE</u></strong>: Students on 4th-year Patient Care Rotations are not permitted to self-arrange their own sites or preceptors.</p><h4><strong>2. Interprofessional Evaluation</strong>: </h4><p>Each student is assessed on their achievement of the interprofessional collaboration competencies (from the National Interprofessional Competency Framework). Students will be evaluated on these outcomes based on their interactions and collaboration with interprofessional healthcare providers.</p><p>Fourth year clinical rotations mark the Application Stage of Waterloo Pharmacy’s IPE program. In this stage, students are expected to apply Exposure Stage foundational knowledge and Immersion Stage skills into practice in all three clinical rotation practice settings.</p><p>For intra-/interprofessional (IP) assessment, students will complete one team-based care (TBC) activity in either PHARM 430, 440 or 450. The TBC activity marks the final Application Stage (APP) checkpoint in the IPE program and students must achieve "Competent" or higher, in all six of the competency areas in order to obtain course credit for their TBC activity.</p><p>Students will have an opportunity to experience and participate in activities encompassing all six competencies. Where this is not possible, students and preceptors have been provided with sample scenarios to roleplay to ensure that the student understands how different scenarios play out in practice and how to navigate them independently for the future. </p><p>Students who do not meet the minimum score for all competency areas (including situations where preceptors have selected ‘competent’ and indicated ‘not observed’ in the comments section) will be required to complete a supplemental assignment to obtain course credit for their TBC activity.</p><h4><strong>3. Community of Practice Assignment:</strong></h4><p>All students will complete an appropriate Community of Practice (CoP) assignment. The exact format and content of this assignment will be determined in collaboration with the preceptor, but should be in response to needs expressed by the rotation’s practice environment and/or the regional Community of Practice. Examples include: <strong>continuing education presentation to local pharmacists, case discussions, interprofessional rounds, local research project, P &amp; T committee submission, public forum or community service presentation.</strong></p><p>Clinical cases will vary based on the demographics of the practice site. Students will be expected to have knowledge of common patient populations (e.g., geriatrics) and common diseases such as but not limited to asthma, COPD, diabetes, and hypertension. Some sites may have a more specialized focus; communication with the preceptor prior to the start of the Patient Care Rotation is strongly encouraged to identify any useful pre-readings.</p><p>Similarly, topics for the community of practice assignment are to be determined in collaboration with the preceptor. Assignments based on “real world” practice and local needs/demands are encouraged.</p><p>Assignment details will be communicated via direct email from the preceptor(s), Regional Clinical Coordinator, Experiential or Administrative Coordinator or on other online learning platforms such as, but not limited to, CORE ELMS.</p><p>In this course, there are activities that are graded, assignments that are mandatory but not graded or events for which the students’ presence is <strong>mandatory</strong>. Such activities may include, but are not limited to monthly group meetings with the Regional Clinical Coordinator (RCC), completing Personal Learning Objectives (PLOs) and preparatory modules. Students are reminded that they should view these activities with the same professionalism as they would a job. Attendance and participation are expected and non-attendance, lack of participation or non-completion of assignments will affect an individual student’s grade in this course, through professionalism grade deductions.</p>

<p>This course grade will be reported and displayed as CR/NCR in Quest. Within CORE, based on the weighting indicated above, a passing grade for this course is 70%. <strong>In order to earn a CR for this course, students must achieve an overall grade of 70% in the clinical practice component and the weighted average of their midpoint assessment and final assessment marks must be 70% or greater. In addition, to be awarded CR for this course, students must also attend all mandatory RCC meetings and complete Personal Learning Objectives. </strong>Students must meet confidentiality and professionalism criteria as outlined below and further in the Patient Care Rotations manual. Students are reminded that they should view these rotations as a course, not a co-op placement/job. Workload and tasks may differ depending on practice sites and students are expected to come prepared to practice while on site. In the event that the weighted assessment average is less than 70%, the final grade will be recorded as the weighted average of the assessments (out of 90%) minus professionalism deductions and without the inclusion of the CoP assignment marks.</p><p>A supplemental exam will not be offered to students who do not achieve a passing grade in this course.</p><p>There is no graded group work in this course.</p><p>As this course runs over an eight-week period, the Registrar’s Office has determined earlier action dates than usual for withdrawing from this course. The last date by which a student may withdraw from the course without academic penalty (WD) is <strong><u>25 teaching days after its start date</u></strong>. Withdrawals after that date will be assigned WF (Withdrew/Failure), for which a grade of 32% will be assigned for the purposes of calculating any academic averages.</p><p>Further details may be obtained from either the Director of Admissions and Undergraduate Affairs, or the Registrar’s Office.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
</p>
<div>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4><strong>Student Evaluation</strong></h4><p>Students may receive a grade of Incomplete (INC) in a course where the student has been unable to complete course work because of verifiable illness or extenuating circumstances. These students must contact the course coordinator to formally request an INC for the course. Course coordinators will clearly define the outstanding course element(s) to be completed and will specify the final date when all outstanding course element(s) are to be received for grading. The onus is on the student to complete all outstanding course elements(s). An online INC Grade Form will then be submitted by the course coordinator no later than the grade submission deadline for the course. Failure to complete work by the deadline indicated will result in the INC grade being changed to FTC (failure to complete). The course will be weighted as a grade of 32 for purposes of calculating the student’s average.</p><h4><strong>Attendance and Absences</strong></h4><p><strong>Attendance at the practice site for the full duration of each Patient Care Rotations is mandatory. </strong>This is inclusive of the first and last dates of the rotation as outlined in the calendar / schedule provided by the School. Planned absences require the prior permission of the <strong>Experiential Coordinator</strong>. Only once a request for absence is approved, it is the student’s responsibility to consult the preceptor as soon as possible to enable the site to plan around the absence and re-schedule the lost hours. It is expected that the student will be in attendance for the equivalent of five days per week (minimum 40 hours per week); however, it is understood that practice sites have varied hours of operation, hence preceptors and students must establish a schedule for the duration of the rotation. Deviations from that schedule would be considered planned absences. <strong>Please note that student travel plans are not considered acceptable reasons for absence.</strong></p><p>A student will be excused for a mandatory activity only under exceptional and unforeseen circumstances. While it is not possible to list all such circumstances, examples include: death of an immediate family member (bereavement); significant illness of a family member; serious personal illness or injury requiring medical attention. Absence requests will be managed on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>Questions should be directed to the Pharmacy Advisors at <a href="mailto:pharmacy.advisor@uwaterloo.ca">pharmacy.advisor@uwaterloo.ca</a>.</p><p>More information can be found on the School of Pharmacy’s “Student Absence” web page <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/current-pharmd-students/student-absence">Student Absence | School of Pharmacy | University of Waterloo</a> and the Undergraduate Calendar: <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations</a><u> </u><a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">(https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations)</a>.</p><p><strong><u>Planned Absences</u></strong></p><p>Regional Activities - Absence for approved regional activities with the Regional Clinical Coordinator is permitted, and the preceptor(s) should be given advance notice.</p><p>Time off for a preapproved professional activity such as a job interview or a conference may be granted.</p><p>The process for student requests for planned absences:</p><ol><li>Student to <strong>send email request for absence to the Experiential Coordinator (EC) </strong>and copy the Regional Clinical Coordinator (RCC).</li><li>The EC will communicate to the student and RCC whether the request has been <u>approved or denied.</u></li><li>If the request is approved, the RCC will communicate the decision to the preceptor and the student will add the absence to Core Elms under the Absence Tracking area.</li></ol><p><strong><u>Unplanned Absences</u></strong></p><p>The process for all students for unplanned absences, e.g., personal illness:</p><ol><li>Student to contact their preceptor to inform them of their absence</li><li>Student to send an email to the Regional Clinical Coordinator and Experiential Coordinator</li><li>Student to obtain <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness Form (VIF)</a> within 48 hours and email form to <a href="mailto:pharmacy.advisor@uwaterloo.ca">pharmacy.advisor@uwaterloo.ca</a></li><li>When feeling better, student to add the absence(s) to Core Elms in the Absence Tracking area</li><li>In order to meet practice hour requirements, students will be required to make-up practice hours.</li></ol><p>*NEW* Flex weeks, first introduced in 2024, are offered after Rotations #1 and #2. Flex Week dates are locked in when the new academic schedule is drafted and are not designed to be moved around within the rotation time frame. Flex Weeks offer an opportunity for students to book personal appointments, enjoy a break between rotations and make-up lost practice hours due to approved absences. The Flex Weeks are available to minimize the impact on academic progression when students are absent during rotations. Make-up practice hours ensures accreditation standards are met for advanced direct patient care experience. </p><p><u>Note</u><strong><u>:</u> </strong>there is no reading week in this course.</p><p><strong>Regional Details</strong></p><p><strong><u>Moving/accommodation:</u></strong></p><p>Patient Care Rotation practice sites are located throughout Ontario. Students should expect to be placed <i><strong>outside of the </strong></i>Waterloo Region and <i><strong>outside of the Greater Toronto Area</strong></i>, due to a limited number of sites in these areas. The School of Pharmacy is <strong>not responsible </strong>for arranging for students’ transportation, moving, or accommodations for Patient Care Rotations.</p><p><strong><u>Regional Clinical Coordinator:</u></strong></p><p>Each region in Ontario has its own Regional Clinical Coordinator (RCC) who is listed in the Patient Care Rotations section of the SOP website. Students will meet RCCs for the first time at the RCC Regional Showcase in the 3A term and individual RCCs will be be identified when students are informed of their regional placements.</p><p><strong><u>Preceptor(s):</u></strong></p><p>Each student is guided and assessed by a primary site preceptor. In the event of a concurrent second site placement, a second preceptor will also assess the student. In some cases, there are co-preceptors assigned to students for assessment. In all practice environments, there may be multiple supportive and influential staff members who provide feedback to the preceptor(s) for the purposes of student assessments.</p><h4><strong>Professionalism, Confidentiality, and Academic Integrity</strong></h4><p>Professionalism is a set of attitudes, skills and behaviours, attributes and values that are expected from those whom society has extended the privilege of being considered a professional.</p><p>Students must take responsibility for acting professionally and demonstrate this in all interactions, behaviours and attitudes, in accordance with required standards. All professionals have a collective professional duty to assure appropriate professional behaviour, particularly in matters of privacy and confidentiality.</p><p>Consistent with University <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33">Policies #33</a> Ethical Behaviour and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">#71 </a>Academic Student Discipline, all professional activities and interactions must be characterized by honesty, integrity, conscientiousness, responsibility and reliability. Further information on professionalism, specific to pharmacy education in Canada may be found in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/current-pharmd-students/student-handbook-professionalism">Student Handbook - Professionalism</a>.</p><p>Recognizing that their involvement in the health care system may put them in positions of power with patients/clients, students must not take advantage of this position to advocate for the student’s personal gain, values or beliefs.</p><p>In preparation for being a fully licensed pharmacist, UW students are expected to be familiar with and to adhere at all times to the Ontario practice standards as governed by OCP. Some important and relevant policies, standards, guidelines and regulations are set out within the list below. This list is not exhaustive.</p><p>1. The Ontario College of Pharmacists (OCP)Code of Ethics for Members of the Ontario College of Pharmacists which can be found at: <a href="http://www.ocpinfo.com/regulations-standards/code-ethics/">http://www.ocpinfo.com/regulations-standards/code-ethics/</a></p><p>2.

Federal and provincial statutes and regulations which can be found at: </p><p><a href="http://www.ocpinfo.com/regulations-standards/">http://www.ocpinfo.com/regulations-standards</a></p><p>5. Each rotation practice site’s corporate, institutional, department or practice documents pertaining to professionalism.</p><p><strong>Adherence to these standards is mandatory for students and will be assessed prior to and throughout each patient care rotation. </strong>Students who anticipate problems in adhering to the policies as required must report promptly to the Experiential Coordinator or delegate.</p><p>At the 2-, 4- and 8-week (4-, 8- and 16-week for 16-week rotations) evaluation, the primary preceptor will assess the following professional behaviours. The 2-week check-in is informal and typically verbal in nature. It will involve OPPCAT to ensure students are on track for their midpoint assessment (4-weeks). Preceptors will indicate ‘Meets Expectations’ or ‘Does not meet expectations’ for each of the following areas of professionalism: </p><ul><li>Accepts responsibility and accountability for own actions and decisions</li><li>Is respectful and cooperative with colleagues and others</li><li>Acknowledges, accepts and applies constructive feedback</li><li>Follows practice site policies and procedures (e.g., dresses in appropriate attire)</li><li>Is punctual and respectful of others’ time</li></ul><p>The Professional behaviours may not be used in the initial grade calculation, at the discretion of the instructor. Repeated patterns of ‘Does not meet expectation’ behaviours will have an <strong>academic</strong> consequence. Inappropriate clinical behaviour should be brought to the student’s attention as soon as possible.</p><p>Professionalism challenges will be addressed as follows:</p><ol><li>When the cumulative number of unacceptable evaluations (i.e., "does not meet expectations" responses on the evaluation form) reaches <strong>2</strong>, the Progressive Remediation Process (PRP), for unacceptable behaviour, will be initiated. A professionalism deduction will also be applied.</li><li>When the cumulative number of unacceptable evaluations (i.e., "does not meet expectations" responses on the evaluation form) reaches <strong>3</strong>, a meeting with the Experiential Coordinator is arranged and the PRP will be followed. In addition, an academic penalty, resulting in at least a 5% reduction in the course grade, will be assigned by the course instructor.</li><li>If the cumulative number of unacceptable evaluations (i.e., "does not meet expectations" responses on the evaluation form) reaches <strong>4</strong>, or if repeated unacceptable behaviours (from previous meetings, communications and assessments), have not been corrected, then a failing grade is assigned.</li></ol><p>A failing grade would result in a delay of graduation. <strong>In addition, there may be consequences where a breach of site (institution or practice) policy and/or contravention of the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) occurs.</strong></p><p>At the primary preceptor’s discretion, the preceptor and (or) RCC may contact the EC to discuss the situation and any remedial action necessary.</p><p>A student who exhibits behaviours that do not meet the expectations of professionalism<u> at any point </u>throughout their rotation will be subject to the progressive remediation process outlined below along with professionalism deductions applied to the student grade.</p><p>Additionally, students are expected to behave professionally not only while on their rotations, but also in interactions with School of Pharmacy faculty and staff. <strong>At the discretion of the EC, up to 10% can be deducted from the final mark if professional behaviour is not demonstrated.</strong></p><h4><strong>Progressive Remediation Process (PRP)</strong></h4><p>This process is designed to mimic what is used in most workplace settings whereby cautionary feedback is provided <strong>verbally</strong> (current challenges, site concerns &amp; how to resolve them, plus a timeline of 7 days – with a summary provided via email), followed by a <strong>written</strong> warning (re-iterating the concerns, stating the expected actions, a timeline of another 7 days and consequences for inaction/repeat inappropriate behaviour – namely <strong>termination</strong> at the end of the 7 days following the written warning). </p><p>The goal of this process is to offer students and preceptors a structured mechanism to navigate specific or repeated professionalism, competence and practice concerns. The spirit of the process is to encourage corrective action and professional growth, with termination used as a last resort by the site (student is not actioning feedback; patient/staff safety is at risk; privacy/confidentiality violations etc).</p><p>The following outlines the steps in the PRP :</p><ol><li>The preceptor will meet with the student to provide <strong>verbal</strong> feedback, with an email follow-up indicating the nature of the meeting, goals – based on feedback and timelines for improvement.</li><li>The preceptor will reach out to the Regional Clinical Coordinator (RCC) to discuss the situation(s).<ol><li>This meeting, or a subsequent separate meeting, will include the student so the student may share their perspective and acknowledge the proposed action plan for improvement.</li></ol></li><li>After 7 days, if the preceptor finds that challenges with the student persist, worsen or there are new issues that arise, they will meet with the student again to provide feedback. There will be an email follow-up indicating the nature of the meeting, goals and timelines. This will constitute a <strong>written</strong> warning to the student.</li><li>The RCC, student and EC will meet to discuss the situation. Student will share their perspective and acknowledge the proposed action plan for improvement, recognizing that the final step in the process is <strong>termination </strong>in 7 days.</li></ol><p><i>For example, <strong>verbal</strong> warnings may be given for reasons such as: not showing up for an appointment or arriving late to the placement site with no reasonable explanation; the first incident of not following proper site policies and procedures.</i></p><p><i>For example, <strong>written</strong> warnings may be given for reasons such as: repeating behaviours outlined in the verbal warning, inappropriate or rude interactions including raising your voice, sarcastic comments or impatience with a colleague, patient or other healthcare professional, repetitive lateness or absences with no reasonable explanation, an incident of verbal abuse to a patient, colleague or other healthcare professional, repetitive lack of adherence to site policy and procedures.</i></p><p>Depending on the nature of the challenges, academic and non-academic offences as outlined in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33">University Policy 33</a> and/or<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"> </a><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 </a>will follow the disciplinary procedures outlined.</p><p>-----------------------------------</p><p><sup>1</sup><a href="http://www.ocpinfo.com/library/practice-related/download/Mandatory%20Reporting.pdf"> Mandatory Reporting: Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991</a> (PDF).<br/><sup>2</sup> Government of Ontario, <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/04p03">Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004</a>, S.O. 2004, c. 3, Schedule A.</p><h4><strong><u>Termination</u></strong></h4><p><strong>Student initiated</strong></p><p>The Community of Practice (Regional) Model – through the inclusion of the RCC team - has proven itself over the last 10+ years to provide well vetted, safe and supportive clinical practice sites for PharmD students. RCCs are adjunct faculty, practicing pharmacists, embedded in the community, however none of the faculty are at every practice site every day, and sometimes practices can change. Examples include staff (preceptor or support) turnover, leave of absences – expected/unexpected, workplace dynamics/politics, sites acquired by another organization, changes to workflow vs. the previous year and so on. While uncommon, there are serious on-site challenges from time to time and it’s important that students contact the RCC (or EC) ASAP to check-in. </p><p>To support student safety and to ensure that preceptor/site practices meet the high standard of expectation for a UW SOP rotation site, if the <strong>student</strong> feels there is a threat to their personal safety or believes something is ‘off’ with their practice site, the student is to contact the RCC and/or EC immediately. Early communication is important as the RCC/EC can help students navigate what is normal at a practice site or in real-world settings, and what is not. If leaving the practice site is in the immediate best interest of the student for personal safety, the student should leave and contact the RCC and/or EC as soon as possible. Failure to do so may result in academic consequences. </p><p>The spirit of this process is to encourage communication and help students understand practice/site norms and expectations while also supporting students who may need to be moved to a new site. With the Community of Practice model, this type of situation is not very common as the RCCs are typically aware of local pharmacy news.  There can, however, be internal site changes from year to year or rotation block to rotation block that create a new dynamic in the pharmacy that the experiential team was not aware of.</p><p>If an investigation by the SOP indicates there are no safety concerns or threats to student learning at the site, the student will be obligated to return to complete their practice hours and assessments as previously scheduled.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Preceptor/Site initiated</strong></p><p>The <strong>preceptor</strong> will notify the student, RCC/EC and/or the academic supervisor if anyone at the practice site has significant concerns, including but not limited to: absenteeism, punctuality, performance issues, inappropriate interaction with clients and/or staff, and/or actions that could put the client or practice site at risk during an unpaid student placement. The examples above fall under the umbrella of professionalism, privacy &amp; confidentiality as well as patient safety. </p><p>If a preceptor encounters any of these significant concerns – they will proceed with the Progressive Remediation Process (PRP). The process allows for students to learn about their perceived challenges, and it provides a timeline within which to take action to make improvements. The process also allows for the site to terminate their relationship with the student if challenges persist unchanged or worsen. </p><p>Notwithstanding the statement above, per the legal Affiliation Agreements between the practice site and the UW School of Pharmacy, most agreements have language built into them whereby a site can terminate a placement immediately when there is deemed to be an immediate and significant threat to care, treatment, privacy/confidentiality or safety of the practice’s patients/clients/staff. This decision is not made lightly and will involve mediation with the Instructor/Experiential Coordinator to determine if the rotation may proceed. <br/><br/>Upon termination of the rotation, the Instructor will request that the preceptor(s) complete a final assessment. If there is a completed midpoint assessment on record (termination occurs after Week 4), then the two assessments will form the basis of the final grade, minus professionalism deductions. If there is no midpoint available (termination occurs prior to Week 4), the completed assessment will stand alone as the basis for the final grade, minus professionalism deductions. The resulting grade percentage will be submitted to the Director of UG Affairs to be uploaded into Quest. Students may achieve greater than the passing grade of 70%, however professionalism must have been maintained throughout the rotation and practice hours must be equal to or greater than 320 to obtain credit for the course. Circumstances will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, recognizing that there is a high likelihood following termination, that the student will be required to repeat the course (a new 8-week rotation, scheduled at a later time).<br/> </p><p><strong>The University of Waterloo privacy and confidentiality training must be completed before the start of the student’s patient care rotation.</strong></p><p><strong>Any digital devices used to facilitate patient care during patient care rotations must be properly encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.</strong></p><h4><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement</strong></h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted in a legally binding treaty to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.
