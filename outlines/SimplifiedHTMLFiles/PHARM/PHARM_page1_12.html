</div>
<div>
<p>Professional Practice 1 is an introduction to pharmacy practice, encompassing the areas of: the pharmacist’s role and responsibility (including standards of practice, professionalism, code of ethics), medication dispensing (including the language and terminology of medicine), jurisprudence, drug information (top 50 drugs), and patient-centred pharmaceutical care. Patient self-care and minor ailments will be a large component of this course, and will provide students with a comprehensive and evidence-based understanding of non-prescription therapeutics and nonpharmacologic measures used to manage common conditions. Emphasis will be placed on interviewing and accurately assessing/triaging patients, selecting appropriate self-care therapies as well as on education/counselling (including self-administration techniques). Students will be equipped with the knowledge, skills, and tools necessary to properly gather information and convey reliable recommendations in an effort to effectively and confidently assess, treat, and educate patients with minor ailments or self-care concerns.</p><p>This course is the first in a series of Professional Practice courses, all of which require students to acquire and apply the knowledge, skills and judgment necessary for contemporary and future pharmacy practice. Professional Practice I will provide the foundation for subsequent pharmacy practice courses.</p><p>The main course material will be presented as case-based didactic lectures, but will also involve discussions in small and large groups relating the learning back to real-life examples. Participation is very important in order to facilitate learning. Students are expected to enhance their own learning by thoroughly preparing for each class, participating in class discussions, asking questions, effectively completing assignments and making meaningful contributions to group work and class activities. The jurisprudence, medical abbreviations, top 50 drugs, and select minor ailment components will involve some self-directed learning.</p>

<p>A passing grade for this course is 60%. Assignments that are not submitted on time will have 20% of the assignment grade deducted per day that it is late. </p><p>Group work accounts for 15% of the total mark.</p><p> </p><p>In certain circumstances, a supplemental exam will be offered to students who do not achieve a passing grade in this course. Students should familiarize themselves with the Doctor of Pharmacy Regulations in the Undergraduate Studies Calendar. As per the regulations, students will only be eligible for a supplemental exam if they have a maximum of one failed course in that academic term and if they are in satisfactory or better academic standing entering that term (except if the term is the 1A term, where this does not apply). In addition, a student’s eligibility to write a supplemental exam in this course, is based on the following criteria that must be fulfilled:</p><p> 1. The student must have achieved a grade of 50.0% or higher</p><p>2. The student has not previously failed the course</p><p>3. The student’s current term average, including the failed course grade, is at least 65%</p><p>4. The student did not fail the course as a result of a penalty for an academic offense</p><p>Students will be notified if they are eligible for a supplemental examination in this course by the Undergraduate Affairs Office after all course examinations for the term have been received and reviewed. The supplemental examination will be a comprehensive assessment of the material covered in the course and the format of the supplemental examination will not necessarily by the same as the format of the original examination.

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted in a legally binding treaty to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Indigenous Initiatives Office</a>.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Student Evaluation</strong></p><p>In this course, there are activities that are graded, assignments that are mandatory but not graded or events for which the students’ presence is mandatory. Students are reminded that they should view these activities with the same professionalism as they would a job. Attendance and participation is expected and non-attendance, lack of participation or non-completion of assignments will affect an individual student’s grade in this course.</p><p> </p><p>Students who need to be absent for mandatory course activities, or who believe that illness or personal circumstances will impact their academic studies in a course, should follow the procedures outlined on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/current-pharmd-students/student-absence#:~:text=Students%20who%20have%20been%20absent,or%20labs%20is%20still%20viable.">Student Absences webpage</a>. In all cases, students must contact the course coordinator for the course as well as <a href="mailto:pharmacy.advisor@uwaterloo.ca">pharmacy.advisor@uwaterloo.ca</a> before or within 24 hours of a mandatory activity to determine necessary accommodations. </p><p> </p><p>In the event that a student unavoidably misses a mandatory activity, a make-up activity may be scheduled for that student at the sole discretion of the course coordinator. In the case of a missed exam, a new exam may be administered. This new exam may be the same as the original exam, may be a different exam, may be of a different format (e.g. an oral test), or may be of a different mix of questions (e.g. the percentage of specific topics on the new exam may differ from the original). In any case, the final decision of the exam format and date that it will be administered will rest solely with the course coordinator. </p><p> </p><p>The course coordinator may also choose to accommodate the missed activity in other ways, such as by re-distributing the weight of the missed activity among other class activities. Again, this will be at the sole discretion of the course coordinator. </p><p> </p><p>Students must discuss the VIF-specified degree of incapacitation with their course coordinators so that their actions are not misinterpreted or viewed with suspicion. A “severe” incapacitation indicates students are unable to engage in any academic studies during the period indicated. <strong>If they attend classes/labs, submit assignments/reports or write tests/exams during this period, they are at risk of being accused of “misrepresentation”; an academic offence, which carries a severe penalty that includes suspension. </strong>A “moderate” incapacitation could trigger a similar allegation, if students claim to be well enough to participate in some tests, while too ill to participate in others. Thus, in these cases it is important that students discuss their degree of incapacitation with their course coordinators so that their actions appear credible.</p><p> </p><p>More information can be found on the School of Pharmacy’s “Student Absence” web page (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/current-pharmd-students/student-absence">https://uwaterloo.ca/pharmacy/current-pharmd-students/student-absence</a>) and the Undergraduate Calendar: <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations</a><u>.</u></p><p> </p><p>Students may receive a grade of Incomplete (INC) in a course where the student has been unable to complete course work because of verifiable illness or extenuating circumstances. These students must contact the course coordinator to formally request an INC for the course. Course coordinators will clearly define the outstanding course element(s) to be completed and will specify the final date when all outstanding course element(s) are to be received for grading. The   onus is on the student to complete all outstanding course elements(s). An online INC Grade Form will then be submitted by the course coordinator no later than the grade submission deadline for the course. Failure to complete work by the deadline indicated will result in the INC grade being changed to FTC (failure to complete). The course will be weighted as a grade of 32 for purposes of calculating the student’s average.</p><p> </p><p>Students that wish to have an assignment or exam re-graded must submit a written request that details why it should be re-graded. This written request must be delivered to the course coordinator within one month (see Appendix B of Policy #70) of the date that the grade was available, and must contain supporting evidence (e.g. from literature, textbooks, or other sources). Students should note that grades may stay the same, be increased or be decreased after re-grading.</p><p> </p><p>Depending upon the request, the course coordinator may decide to re-grade the whole assignment or test, and not just the question that is being challenged. Students should not mark in any way assignments or tests that they think may warrant a re-examination. Only assignments and tests that are completed in indelible ink are eligible for re-grading.</p><p> </p><p>In accordance with University policy, all assessments will be retained for one year after term grades become official. After that time, they will be destroyed in compliance with the University’s confidential shredding procedures.</p><p>Students will be given one opportunity, for a maximum time to be specified by the instructor, to review their midterm papers after they have been graded. Students will be given one opportunity, for a maximum time to be specified by the instructor, to review their final exam after course grades have been released, if they submit a written request to the course coordinator within a 6-month period. Requests to see exams for a second time will not be accommodated. When viewing graded exams, students are not permitted to take notes, or have any electronic devices on their person.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Changes to Course Outline</strong></p><p>The topics addressed in this course, as well as the schedule of topics, may be revised as the course progresses. Any changes will be announced in class and posted on LEARN or on other online learning platforms. <strong>The assessment weights CANNOT be altered. </strong>There is one exception. When a student has been excused from completing a mandatory assessment (a midterm, for example), the decision about how and when this assessment will be completed is at the discretion of the course coordinator. In this instance, the coordinator may choose to alter assessment weights by re- allocating marks from a midterm to a final exam. See the Student Assessment section of this document for more information.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Remote Teaching and Learning: Student Notice of Recording</strong></p><p>Activities for this course may involve recording, in partial fulfillment of the course learning outcomes. You will receive notification of recording via at least one of the following mechanisms: within the Learning Management System (LEARN), a message from your course instructor, course syllabus/website, or other means.

Rather than focusing on the diagnosis, AccessAbility Services focuses on the ‘functional limitations’ that are impacting your ability to participate in post-secondary studies.</p><p> </p><p>You can apply for academic accommodations as soon as you become aware of (or suspect) a disability, medical condition, and/or have experienced trauma that is impacting your academics. Students are required to register at the beginning of every term, even if they have received academic accommodations in the past.</p><p> </p><p>To begin the registration process, complete the online application (<a href="https://york.accessiblelearning.com/uwaterloo/">https://york.accessiblelearning.com/uwaterloo/</a>) and upload supporting documentation, if available. If you do not have documentation because you suspect that you have an undiagnosed and undocumented disability (e.g., a learning disability, ADHD, a mental health disability, and/or a disabling condition) you should also submit the “Suspected Disability Self-Assessment Form” (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/self-assessment">https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/self-assessment</a>).</p><p> </p><p>Once your application and supporting documentation (if applicable) has been reviewed, you will be invited to meet with an Accommodations Consultant to finalize your registration, and develop your individualized academic accommodation and support plan.</p><p> </p><p>Once you have an accommodation plan, you will request your accommodations from your eligibility plan, for each course, using an online system. AccessAbility Services will communicate your accommodation plan to your course instructors and your pharmacy academic advisors.</p><p> </p><p>Your pharmacy academic advisors will then contact you to arrange an appointment to offer support and discuss your accommodation plan and how it will be implemented.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Expectation of Academic Integrity</strong></p><p><strong><u>Academic Integrity</u></strong></p><p>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin® in this course.</p><p> </p><p>Students are reminded that in accordance with University <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><i>Policy 71 – Student Discipline</i></a>, the "<i>obtaining, distributing, or receiving of any confidential academic material without the express consent of the instructor" </i>is considered an academic offence. As such, students should not procure, use, attempt to use or distribute any improper or unauthorized materials related to tests, including, but not limited to: test questions, copies of paper tests, test files of any type (electronic or non-electronic) and/or test passwords. Any intentional attempt to access the test outside of the scheduled test time, and/or disable or tamper with the test in any form, including, but not limited to: paper tests/ExamSoft/Examplify’s security features may be subject to the University’s academic discipline procedure.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Discipline</u></strong></p><p>Students are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offenses, and to take responsibility for their actions. Students who are unsure whether an action constitutes an offense, or who need help in learning how to avoid offenses (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about ‘rules’ for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course coordinator, academic advisor, or the Associate Dean of Science for Undergraduate Studies.

You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.
