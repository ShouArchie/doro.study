  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Policy on Late Work</h4><p>All assignments must be uploaded by due dates (when dropboxes will lock). Any work you need to submit past the due date requires documentation in order not to be subject to the late work policy (please inform about any work to be submitted late and provide documentation in a timely manner). Work submitted late will be penalized 2% per day up to 7 days after due date. After 7 days, no work will be accepted.</p><h4>Correspondence</h4><p>Students are expected to stay abreast of communication about the course through LEARN. <strong>Every Monday, your instructor will post the weekly beginning-of-the-week announcement (on LEARN announcements) which specifies what work to complete for the specific week. The weekly discussion topic opens every Monday, starting on the second week of classes, and remains open until 11:59 PM of Sunday night (unless otherwise noted in the Course Schedule). The weekly quiz is held on a Friday (starting on the second Friday of the term). It opens at 12:01 AM and closes at 11:59 PM.</strong></p><h4>Plagiarism</h4><p>During subsequent waves of the COVID 19 pandemic, the issue of plagiarism has become increasingly pressing. Please understand the various forms that plagiarism may take and that it is a very serious academic offence. <strong>Furthermore, using ChatGPT or any other tools of AI while writing assignments/ take-home tests is strictly prohibited. The final paper will be tested in an ORAL test. If the student does not show clear knowledge of argument and sources used in the final paper, both oral test and final paper will result in a FAIL. The instructor may also decide to hold oral tests to assess knowledge written about in midterm test/ final test. Once again, if the student does not demonstrate in extempore fashion clear knowledge of what they have written about, the instructor may declare the midterm test/ final test insufficient and the student will FAIL the test.</strong></p><p>According to the University's <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (Student Discipline), plagiarism is defined as "...the act of presenting the ideas, words, or other intellectual property of another as one's own. The use of other people's work must be properly acknowledged and referenced in all written material.... Use of [source material] without complete and unambiguous acknowledgement...is an offence under this policy."</p><p>According to UWaterloo’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/"><u>Office of Academic Integrity</u></a>, here are some (though not all) of the types of plagiarism that constitute an academic offence:</p><ul><li>Word-for-word use of part or all of any written work (print or electronic) without quotation marks and/or without citation of the source (footnotes, endnotes, or parenthetic citations) and/or without a complete ‘works cited’ section.</li><li>Word-for-word use of text spans (phrases, sentences, paragraphs, longer segments) patched together from two or more sources without quotation marks and/or without citation of the source and/or without a complete 'works cited'.</li><li>Word-for-word use of primary source materials without quotation marks and/or without citation of the source and/or without a complete 'works cited'.</li><li>Word-for-word use of source materials with some text enclosed by quotation marks and provided with citations, but with other text not identified as quoted, and/or not cited, and/or without a complete 'works cited'.</li><li>Combination of word-for-word use of sources with close paraphrases of source texts, with accurate use of quotation marks and citations (note or parenthetic) to identify word-for-word use, but without citations to identify paraphrases and summaries, and/or without a complete ‘works cited’.</li><li>Completely paraphrased material without complete citations and/or without a complete ‘works cited’.</li><li>Giving a citation for only the first or last sentence in a paragraph, even though the rest of the paragraph also contains material in need of direct attribution.</li></ul><p><strong>In general:</strong> A complete and accurate 'works cited' page constitutes only one part of the fulfilment of the requirement for complete and unambiguous acknowledgement of sources. A very large proportion of plagiarized essays do have perfectly or nearly adequate 'works cited' pages. If the paper's reader has to go to (or hunt for), and has to look directly at, the text of the source in order to identify where the student's own thoughts and words end and the source's thoughts and words begin, then the paper is plagiarized.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p><strong>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or St. Jerome’s University</strong>. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p><strong>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.</strong> For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the St. Jerome’s University for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system. The faculty and staff in Arts encourage students to seek out mental health support if they are needed.</p><p><strong>On Campus </strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Counselling Services</a> 519-888-4096</li><li><a href="https://wusa.ca/services/uw-mates">MATES</a>:  one-to-one peer support program offered by the Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) and Counselling Services</li></ul><p><strong>Off campus, 24/7</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://good2talk.ca/">Good2Talk</a>:  Free confidential help line for post-secondary students.

For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>We acknowledge that we are living and working on the traditional territory of the Attawandaron (also known as Neutral), Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes ten kilometres on each side of the Grand River.</p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory"><u>CAUT Guide to Acknowledging Traditional Territory</u></a>.</p>

<div>
<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
