<p><strong>Tests</strong></p><p>There will be three regular term multiple-choice/short answer tests: Test 1, January 30; Test 2, March 6; Test 3, April 1. Each test will be worth 25% of your final grade. The tests will contain a relatively equal balance of lecture and textbook material and will primarily include material covered after the previous test. Grades will be posted as soon as they are available.</p><p>Please note that I will let the text provide a general overview of the material for a given topic and I will use class time to add new material, amplify important issues, and focus on specific topics in more depth. Thus, although there will be some overlap between class and text material, there will be a lot of different material in each. </p><p>Also, please understand that my goal is to be fair to everyone. Therefore, the mark received for a test stands – it will not be dropped or re-weighted because you weren’t feeling well, had a lot on your mind, etc., nor will extra assignments be given to students who are dissatisfied with their grades.  Of course, tests will be rescheduled for legitimate medical, compassionate, or religious grounds. You are welcome to make a case for other factors that may create a <i>level</i> playing field but please don’t ask for special treatment. </p><p><strong>Group Research Poster and Poster Presentation</strong></p><p>Posters worth 25% of your grade will be presented on the last day of class. There are two goals for this group assignment. First, this assignment provides an opportunity for you to educate your fellow students on a specific topic in the field of personal relationships that is currently receiving research attention. Second, it provides you with the experience of working collaboratively in a group. This course offers you principles on how to work constructively and effectively with others and this project will give you the opportunity to apply this knowledge in an interpersonal context where you will need to coordinate with others and work as a team - a context that you are likely to encounter when you enter the workforce.</p><p>A. <i>Group work expectations.</i> I want to minimize the possibility of any sad, ironic situations where students in a course on interpersonal relationships fail to respect their group members and work cooperatively, do not do their fair share, or succumb to the temptation of cutting corners by plagiarizing or improperly citing material. Therefore, keep the following in mind:</p><ol><li><i>Realize that the poster project is group-oriented, required, and worth 25%</i>. This group project is a required part of the course. It is not optional and there will no opportunity for alternative assignments. If you’re not in a position to commit yourself fully to participating in a group project this term please look for a different class that’s a better fit for you right now.</li><li><i>Every group member is expected to do their fair share</i>. To help ensure this, after posters have been submitted for final marking, all members of a group are expected to submit ratings of their own performance as well as that of all other members using a form that we will provide. This is a required component of the project and the failure to submit this form can result in a grade of 0% for the project. If the majority judges an individual’s task completions to be insufficient, that individual may be subject to a post mark deduction to be determined by the instructor. The failure to make any meaningful contribution to the project will be treated as being comparable to not having submitted a required assignment and will receive a grade of 0%.</li><li><i>Every group member is responsible for ensuring that their individual contributions are fairly acknowledged.</i> I <i>strongly encourage</i> each group member to keep an independent record of all relevant activities, e.g., an activity log that includes documentation of meetings, rough notes related to their research/writing, etc. If multiple within-group peer reviews suggest that a specific member did not do their fair share of the work, we would request that the member in question provide documentation to dispute this if they can. </li><li><i>All members of a group are responsible for ensuring that</i> source material is credited properly, that quoted material is in quotation marks and cited, etc. – in other words, that <i>any appearance of plagiarism has been avoided</i>. Failure to do so risks significant mark deductions for all group members and – in extreme cases – formal academic misconduct proceedings. Please note that these are “nuclear” options: I don’t want to use them and I don’t expect to need them (but I will use them if I have to).</li></ol><p>B.  <i>Develop the content of your poster.</i></p><ol><li>Select a <i>general interpersonal relationship construct</i> and familiarize yourselves with the current research on this construct.</li><li>Narrow your focus to a <i>very</i> <i>specific research question</i> involving this construct that is receiving current research attention – this could involve studies that present a new theory or theoretical variation, try to resolve an ongoing controversy, or investigate the relationship of the construct with a different construct. You should narrow down your topic so that you have around 4 to 6 research articles on your specific topic. Note that these should be empirical research articles, NOT qualitative studies or meta-analyses.</li><li><i>Summarize the research</i> on the specific research question or issue that you have chosen.</li><li>Present a <i>conclusion</i> (i.e., a take-home message) that presents the current state of knowledge on your research question.</li><li>Propose <i>what should be studied next</i> and provide a <i>rationale</i> for why this is the logical next step.</li><li>Prepare a very, very, very brief <i>verbal presentation</i> that summarizes the key aspects of your poster.</li></ol><p>C.  <i>Prepare a poster</i> (no more than 1m high x 1.25m wide) that presents the information that you have found in a clear, concise, and engaging manner. Creativity is welcomed, but your primary focus should be on a succinct, clearly stated, easily accessible visual presentation of the information that you have found. The use of point form rather than full sentences is strongly recommended. Your poster should have the following sections:</p><ol><li>A description of the construct you are focusing on and an overview of the main questions that are currently being studied.</li><li>A descriptive summary of the research on the specific question or issue that you are dealing with. This section may have sub-sections.</li><li>A conclusion that highlights the central take-home message of the research that you have summarized</li><li>A proposal and rationale for a logical next step for future research</li></ol><p>D.  <i>Present your poster.</i></p><ol><li>The poster session will be held during class time on the last day of class.</li><li>One or more group members is expected to be present at the poster to give an extremely short verbal summary of what you have learned and to answer any questions. </li><li>During the poster session, group members who are not presenting will be viewing and evaluating the other posters. These evaluations must be submitted to us and we will use them as additional information when we grade the assignment.</li></ol><p>E. <i>Additional information.</i></p><ol><li>Groups will consist of 4 to 5 people. We will assist you in forming groups.</li><li>Poster printing is available at W Print on the UW campus at a cost of $6/square foot but may be available at other locations for less. So, for example, the printing cost for a 3ft x 4ft poster works out to about $15-per-person in a 5-person group. Please note that gluing 8.5” x 11” pages to a poster board (and similar approaches) are not acceptable.</li><li>Additional details regarding logistics, example posters, and tips for success will be posted on LEARN well in advance of the due date.</li></ol><p><strong>Sona Participation and Research Experience Marks Information and Guidelines</strong></p><p>Up to 3% bonus grade is available via SONA research participation (or the infrequently chosen article review option). Study scheduling, participation and grade assignment is managed using the SONA online system.  All students enrolled in this course have been set up with a SONA account.  You must get started early in the term.</p><p>As an active researcher I ask that you <i><strong>PLEASE TAKE ANY RESEARCH PARTICIPATION SERIOUSLY</strong></i> – careless completion of a study’s materials is a waste of everyone’s time and undermines the research process.</p><p>For instructions on how to log in to your SONA account and for a list of important dates and deadlines please, as soon as possible, go to:</p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/welcome-research-experiences-group-and-sona/sona-information"><u>Participating/SONA information:  How to log in to Sona and sign up for studies </u></a><i>*** Please do not ask the Course Instructor or REG Coordinator for information unless you have first thoroughly read the information provided on this website.***</i></p><p>More information is available in a separate document on LEARN.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as finding and summarizing research information and working together in groups. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices.
