  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>LS 403:</div>
<p>Public policy responses to crime includes patterns in police decision making about what constitutes a crime, expert and lay theories on the causes of crime, political pronouncements on what to do about criminal offenders, and beliefs about the purposes of incarceration, amongst other formal and informal facets of the criminal justice system. Focusing on the experience of marginalized groups such as youth, women, and racialized persons, this course will help students develop a critical understanding of the ways in which public policy responses to crime can reproduce wider patterns of discrimination in society, especially those pertaining to race and Indigeneity. Through examination of current research in this area students will gain reflexive analytical skills to critically evaluate the relationship between the law and inequality.</p>

<p>Formal social control operates at the macro level in the form of laws and criminal justice policy. It simultaneously occurs at the micro level in the form of responses to crime by actors in the criminal justice system. This interdisciplinary course draws on historical, philosophical, legal, psychological, and sociological perspectives to explore the dynamics of social and criminal justice policy, the use of social control, and responses to crime in Canada.</p><p>The overall focus throughout the course will be on understanding the impact of socio-legal policies and practices on responses to crime. To this end, aspects of the nexus between law and society are examined to explore the efficacy of the criminal justice system to respond to complex social problems, marginalized populations, and dangerous offenders. The course is broadly divided into three areas. In the first part of the course, we review the structure of the criminal justice system in Canada, policy development, and the history of selective criminalization. Next, we go into greater depths on responses to specialized populations (e.g., Indigenous Canadians, women, youth). Finally, we apply this knowledge to look at specialized responses, such as problem-solving courts and restorative justice.</p>

<p><i>Debate Assignment (2 x 15%)</i></p><p>For these assignments, students will be put into two groups (students can find their assigned groups on LEARN), and the group assignment will indicate which position you will take in the debate assignment. However, the debate assignments are individual assignments; each student will submit an assignment via the dropbox on LEARN. These assignments are to be 3-4 pages, with proper APA citation and referencing (including a references page). In these assignments, students will argue one position on the given topic. I will post the specific topics and further instructions in the folders under the content section on LEARN. The first assignment is due Sunday, February 16th at 11:59 pm and the second assignment is due Sunday, March 23rd at 11:59 pm. The assignments will be evaluated based on how clearly and persuasively you argue your position, which means using the empirical and theoretical information to support your argument. The assignments will also be evaluated for writing and style, meaning the assignments should be proofread and edited with proper referencing and citations. The debate assignments will be screened via plagiarism detection software TurnItIn.</p><p><i>Midterm (30%)</i></p><p>The midterm will take place in class on February 24<sup>th</sup>. It will cover all lecture and text material from weeks 1 to 7. The test is closed book and will consist of a combination of short and long answers. More information on the format of the exam will be given before the reading week break.</p><p><i>Term paper (40%)</i></p><p>Students are to choose their own area of policy analysis for the term paper. Ideally, the policy was discussed in class, but what is important is that you use the term paper to make an argument about the policy as a response to criminal offending in Canada. You should be taking a clear position in the term paper and using the empirical evidence you find in your research to support your position. I encourage students to talk to me and/or the TAs about your topic early as we will help make sure your topic is manageable.</p><p>The term paper is to be a minimum of eight (8) pages to a maximum of ten (10) double-spaced pages, plus references. In-text citations and the reference list must conform to the APA (American Psychological Association) formatting guidelines. Material from the course plus 6-8 additional outside scholarly resources are required. If unsure, please confirm the acceptability of internet sources with the instructor. The term paper is due in the dropbox on LEARN on April 14<sup>th</sup> at 11:59 pm.</p><h2>Make-up and Late Policy</h2><p>If a student misses the midterm, it is required that proper medical documentation be submitted for a make-up to be considered. Late papers will be penalized 10% per day, including weekends. </p>
</div>
<a></a>
<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.
