<p><strong>Tests will be written in our regular classroom at our scheduled class time. Tests will consist of 50 multiple Choice questions. You will have 45 minutes to complete the test. For test purposes, students are responsible for all material covered in class, and for the assigned readings.</strong></p><p><strong>Note: In each PowerPoint Lecture there is material highlighted in yellow. All test questions will be drawn from this highlighted material. Use this to guide your studying for the tests.</strong></p><p><strong>Essays are due, <u>in class,</u> on Monday March 10 (by 4:00 pm)<u>.</u> After March 10, 5% will be deducted for each class day that the essay is late (i.e. an 85% becomes an 80% after one day late).  After Friday April 4, I will not be accepting any late essays. Hand in your essay in person in order to avoid loss of grades due to “a friend who forgot to hand it in for you”, or a “computer that failed to e-mail it” properly. I do not have a drop box.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><u>HIST 236 / LS 236 Policy on Missed Tests</u></strong></p><p><strong>If you miss a test for approved reasons (as outline above), such as Religious Observances, declaring a Short-term Absence, submitting a Verification of Illness Form or completing the Extenuating Circumstances Process, you will be provided an opportunity to write the missed test either in class the next day, or at my office at a mutually agreed upon time. My policy is to return graded tests within a week of students writing them, so students who have been ill longer than a week (ie after the graded tests have been returned) will be given the alternative written assignment in place of the returned test. Be sure to contact me immediately (ie within 48 hours) if you miss a test. </strong></p><p><strong>If you missed a test for non-approved reasons, such as you “forgot” to write the test, you will be provided with an opportunity to either write the test or complete the alternative assignment as outlined above, <u>but that test/essay assignment will only make up for half of the grade for the missed test</u>. Should you not contact me within 48 hours of the test closing, you will not be provided with an alternative assignment and your grade will remain a 0.</strong></p><p><strong>Test times for students will not be changed due to previously booked trips or other events.</strong></p><p><strong><u> </u></strong></p>

<h4><strong><u>Covid Contingency Plans (if needed):</u></strong></h4><p><strong>Should SJU/UW need to return to an on-line format and cancel all in-person classes due to COVID health concerns, the following changes to the course will be put in place: </strong></p><p><strong>Every PowerPoint lecture posted on the course Learn site will have an audio component added to it (only during the on-line time period) that would cover the same content as the originally scheduled in-person lecture. <u>Students may access these asynchronously</u>. </strong></p><p><strong>Students should follow the same course schedule for delivery of lectures and tests as originally posted. The three Term Tests will still be delivered on the course Learn site, as scheduled, but all questions will be multiple choice. The research essay will be delivered to me at </strong><a href="mailto:dhutter@uwaterloo.ca"><strong>dhutter@uwaterloo.ca</strong></a><strong> as scheduled.</strong></p><p> </p><h4><strong><u>Generative AI:</u></strong></h4><p><strong>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as a research essay or an alternative written assignment to replace a missed test. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><strong><u>Policy 71</u></strong></a><strong> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (</strong><a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><strong><u>ICAI</u></strong></a><strong>, n.d.). </strong></p><p><strong>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </strong></p><p><strong>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous"><strong>Office of Indigenous Relations.</strong></a></p><p> </p><h4><strong><u>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo:</u></strong></h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><strong><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></strong></a><strong> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6.</strong></p><p> </p><h4><strong><u>Anti-Racism Statement:</u></strong></h4><p><strong>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><strong><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></strong></a><strong> or through their </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/"><strong>website.</strong></a></p><p> </p><h4><strong><u>Cross-listed courses:</u></strong></h4><p><strong>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</strong></p><p> </p><h4><strong><u>Held-with courses:</u></strong></h4><p><strong>Please note that a held-with course will only count in the average for the subject code under which it has been taken, unless it is cross-listed with the subject code of its’ held-with course. For example, if a CLAS/HIST held-with course is taken under the CLAS subject code then it will count only in the CLAS major average, not the HIST major average. A held-with course will also only count towards program and breadth requirements of the subject code under which it is taken, unless it is cross-listed with the subject code of its’ held-with course.</strong></p><h4> </h4><h4><strong><u>Intellectual Property:</u></strong></h4><p><strong>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </strong></p><p><strong>Intellectual property includes items such as:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</strong></li><li><strong>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</strong></li><li><strong>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</strong></li><li><strong>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</strong></p><p><strong>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.
