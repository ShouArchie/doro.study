<p>More can be said as an introduction to the course beyond that which is in the calendar. While the course introduces you to basic concepts in law, it is designed for, and particularly emphasizes topics that will be of specific relevance to you as future business managers, owners, or even practicing professionals. Most important, the emphasis is not only on legal principles but on the effective management of legal risk. This includes understanding the basics of legal risk so you can make more effective business decisions. Business managers/owners often must engage in risk management exercises. Risk generally incorporates legal risk. This course will help you to begin to incorporate legal parameters in your decision making. Further, when confronted with very obvious legal issues of some complexity and significance, you are unlikely to be making decisions without the assistance of trained lawyers. In order to interact effectively with members of the legal profession and the legal environment generally, to ask the right questions and to understand the answers you receive, it helps to know key principles as well as having some understanding of the business law environment in which your business operates. AFM 231 is an anti-requisite to: MTHEL 100/COMM 231, BUS 231W, CIVE 491, GENE 411, ME 401(Faculty of Mathematics), ENVS 201. If you happen to have taken one of the anti-requisite courses already it is imperative you speak to your instructor as soon as possible.</p>

Once you access the link you will receive some brief further instructions to act on and obtain your text access. There will also be a 7th edition hardcopy of the text on 3 hr reserve in Porter Library. It is acceptable to use older editions of the text material for the course but students will do so at their own risk. To be clear, there aren't major revisions of the text from one edition of the text to the next, but nor will the instructor be intentionally establishing course evaluation elements with strict consideration of consistency across all text editions. Accordingly, if students do opt to use an older edition it would be advisable to use an edition that is as close to the 8th edition as possible and consider cross-referencing it to the current edition and noting any differences. </p>

<h3><strong>In-Class Hypotheticals </strong></h3><p>Throughout the semester, you will be presented eight (8) hypothetical scenarios in class based on your readings for that week. You will be required to post a response to the question included in the scenario by Friday 11:59 pm EST that week through Learn.  </p><p><strong>Hypotheticals Grading: </strong></p><p>The weekly hypothetical assignment is 30% of the overall course grade. As noted, the expectation is that students will submit a response each week, starting the second week of class.  Students will not be expected to post during the following weeks: Midterm Week and the final 2 weeks as there are different course responsibilities those weeks and the priority is for you to focus on your examinations. The grade for each hypothetical will be calculated out of three points based on four factors: (a) completion (b) application of course material concepts, (c) application of the relevant course concept to an alternate real-world example and (d) persuasiveness and creativity. Below is a more detailed rubric:    </p><p><strong> </strong></p><figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Criteria</strong></th><th><strong>Points</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th></tr><tr><th><strong>Completion</strong></th><th><p>1</p></th><th>The response must be submitted on time by the specified deadline (Friday 11:59 pm EST of the week it was assigned). Late or missing submissions will receive 0 points for this criterion.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Application of Course Material</strong></td><td><p>1</p></td><td>The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the relevant course concepts and effectively applies these concepts to the hypothetical scenario.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Application to Real-World Example</strong></td><td><p>1</p></td><td>The response includes an appropriate real-world example that relates to the course material, illustrating how the concept can be applied outside the context of the hypothetical. Students may also include a revised answer based on a similar but different set of hypothetical facts. For example, a student may propose one solution based on the given facts but suggest a different solution if the facts were altered.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Persuasiveness and Creativity</strong></td><td><p>1</p></td><td>The response is compelling, original, and thoughtfully crafted, demonstrating the student’s ability to present ideas in an engaging and innovative manner.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Total Points per Hypothetical: 4</strong></p><p><strong>Grading Scale:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>4 Points</strong>: Full completion with a strong application of course material, an insightful real-world example or alternative hypothetical analysis, and a persuasive, creative response.</li><li><strong>3 Points</strong>: Completion with an adequate application of course material and a relevant real-world example, but the response may lack persuasiveness or creativity.</li><li><strong>2 Points</strong>: Partial completion, with either a correct but insufficient application of course material, an inadequate or missing real-world example, or limited originality in the response.</li><li><strong>1 Point</strong>: Response submitted but shows minimal understanding of the course material, lacks a real-world example, or fails to demonstrate persuasive or creative engagement.</li><li><strong>0 Points</strong>: No response submitted, or the response does not address the prompt in any meaningful way.</li></ul><p>Additional Notes:</p><ul><li>Students are expected to demonstrate critical thinking and clearly articulate their reasoning.</li><li>Responses should be concise yet thorough, staying on-topic and providing adequate explanation.</li><li>General feedback will be provided in class as well as a review of answers. This is meant  to guide collective improvement on future assignments and ensure students are engaging with course concepts.</li></ul><p> </p><h3>Weekly Quizzes:</h3><p>There are 9 quizzes in this course. The best 8 of 9 of these comprise a total of 20% of your final grade. Each quiz covers content that relates to the current course content (the current chapters and occasionally a prior chapter as well if it has not yet been part of a quiz).  </p><p>While students are not completing the exact same version of a quiz, communicating among students will not be considered an academic offence on this course element. The instructor will, within a few days of a quiz being completed, release the quiz responses as well as student’s answers (available only to the student) so they can assess their performance beyond seeing the numeric grade (which will be available upon completion of the quiz).</p><p> </p><h4><i>Submission Times</i></h4><p>Please be aware that the University of Waterloo is located in the Eastern Time Zone (GMT or UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time) and, as such, the time for your activities and/or assignments are due is based on this zone.  If you are outside of the Eastern Time Zone and require assistance converting your time, please try the <a href="https://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_CA-ON.aspx"><u>Ontario, Canada Time Converter</u></a>.</p><h4><i>Reevaluation Request</i></h4><p>Requests for re-evaluation of submitted material can be done via email. Such requests should be made within a week of a result being made available to students. Also, students should detail what their concern as specifically as possible. <strong> </strong>Students should also understand that if a grade represents a reasonable exercise in judgment on the part of the grader, the grade will not be changed. The focus will be on addressing any notable oversights in evaluating submitted material which, although infrequent, can happen. </p><h4><i>Late/Missed Submission Policy</i></h4><p>Due dates and times for submission set out are firm and you should not simply assume assignments or other course elements will be routinely accepted after the time and date and time specified for the assignment. Without a reason for lateness or missing an assessment being accepted by the course instructor (with supporting documentation provided as appropriate and within a reasonable time depending on the circumstances) the student will receive a 0 grade for the assessment. Reasonable explanations will still be considered and accepted as appropriate. What it does mean however, is that you need to take the initiative to follow up as soon as possible/feasible (if health is involved, as your health permits) so that the situation can be assessed, and a determination made in a timely way.</p><h4><i>Changes to in-class Meeting Schedule </i></h4><p>It is possible that the university may need to cancel classes for a short period of time and/or transition in person instruction to an online format during the term (and with short notice). In the event of a university required change, using an appropriate technology platform we will adopt an alternative meeting schedule that, as much as possible, mirrors/matches the existing in-person meeting schedule for the course/section.</p><p>Similarly, in the event of short-term instructor illness (e.g., a single class), any cancellation will be posted via course announcements.</p>
</div>
<a></a>
<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.<br/><br/>Artificial Intelligence Tools<br/>The use of any artificial intelligence tool (ChatGPT or other) is discouraged as the benefit of learning comes from active engagement with the material. If, for any submission, there is a clear indication (in the sole discretion of the evaluator) that the quality of the submitted/posted content is lacking and/or is simply incorrect (e.g., hallucination) that may be factored into the assessment which could include receiving 0 if the quality of the input seems wholly inadequate, incorrect, or inauthentic. In this regard, IF a student chooses to nonetheless use a generative AI tool it is important that they take the time to use it effectively all of which includes, using effective prompts to generate quality AI output, effectively reviewing, editing, revising AI created content so that it is correct, effective, and authentic (i.e., it reads like a quality human submission). Keep in mind, flowery or verbose language, gaps in logical connections in the writing etc., can all be an indicator of poor of non-existent editing/revising of originally generated AI output. Also, some evaluation elements are structured such that it may be even quicker to do it yourself than to utilize an AI tool and then further edit/revise before submission.<br/>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system. The faculty and staff in Arts encourage students to seek out mental health support if they are needed.</p><p><strong>On campus supports</strong></p><p>For counselling (individual or group) reach out to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Campus Wellness and Counselling Services.</a> Counselling Services strives to provide a secure, supportive environment for students of all orientations and backgrounds.

In the event of a university required change, or even short-term instructor unavailability due to illness or other reason, using an appropriate technology platform we will normally adopt an alternative meeting schedule that, as much as possible, mirrors/matches the existing in-person meeting schedule for the course/section. Both lectures and exams can be accessed remotely via technology platforms such as Teams, WebEx, Zoom, or MyLab. </p><p>Note that for students Covid-specific accommodations need to be registered through the process mentioned above. Consult the Accommodations for Missed Assessments as well as SAF Process for Requesting Accommodation for Missed Assessments sections. Any on-campus in-person assessments that require modification due to a university mandated change connected to in-person gathering will, if necessary, proceed in a manner that best achieves the intentions of the original assessment format. Any necessary changes will be communicated as soon as we reasonably can during the course of the term.</p><h3> </h3><p> </p><h3>School of Accounting and Finance Academic Integrity Expectations</h3><p>Students at Waterloo and in SAF are expected to act with integrity, even when faced with difficult situations. Information on basic university expectations are provided below in “University Policies”. In addition, integrity is the cornerstone of the accounting and finance professions. What you practice at the University of Waterloo and in SAF will inform and even define who you are as an A&amp;F professional. As a student at the University of Waterloo and in SAF you are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, avoid committing offences and take responsibility for your actions. While there are common university wide expectations, you will also be expected to know and comply with course specific expectations as well. Participating in the course introduction and reviewing the course syllabus are basic expectations and are helpful regarding course specific academic requirements.</p><p>Policy 71 governs student discipline on campus and SAF works with the Associate Deans of a student’s home faculty when reporting academic misconduct. All suspected academic misconduct, regardless of type or severity, is reported to the appropriate Associate Dean who will review the evidence and apply the appropriate discipline and penalties.</p><p>Specific considerations for SAF students:</p><ul><li>Students majoring in accounting and finance programs at UWaterloo should be aware that, due to the highly structured nature of the study plans and the fact that many AFM courses are offered on a limited basis, a penalty imposed because of an academic offence could result in a significant delay of the student’s degree completion and convocation dates - particularly if the penalty involves a suspension.</li><li>Students placed on disciplinary probation will not be granted access to activities where they are viewed as an SAF representative. For example, students represent SAF in the AFM Fellowship Program, the Student Investment or Venture Fund, at case competitions, as TAs or Research Assistants, and as recruitment ambassadors. This is not an exhaustive list. When applying to participate in these activities, students are expected to declare if they are/are not on disciplinary probation. Normally, this access is denied for a period that spans two complete academic terms subsequent to the term in which the offence occurs.</li></ul><p>The academic integrity expectations for each of the assessments in this course have been outlined above as have the potentially unique implications for SAF students who fail to meet integrity expectations. These expectations are provided for further clarity and accompany the expectations outlined below in the discipline section (university policies) and do not replace or reduce the importance of these expectations. If ever you are unsure about what’s expected of you, you are responsible for seeking clarification from an appropriate source. “I did not know” is not an acceptable personal justification or formal defense to an allegation.</p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a><u>.</u></p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory">CAUT Guide to Acknowledging Traditional Territory</a>. </p><h3>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances</h3><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spaces/">multi-faith spaces</a> that students can use for faith-based practices. that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h3>SAF Process for Missed Assessments</h3><p>Students are expected to complete all course assessments and write examinations as scheduled; however, there may be circumstances where accommodating a missed assessment is approved. <strong>See your course syllabus for specific accommodation policies that apply to your course.</strong> It is possible the syllabus will identify a process that renders redundant any need to formally declare an absence by means discussed below (e.g., for regular quizzes perhaps the syllabus will identify that only x of y attempts will be included in the final grade).<br/><br/>Review “<strong>Declaring Absences</strong>” below for instructions on how to declare absences and request accommodations for missed course component(s). To be considered for an academic accommodation, SAF students must follow the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Arts Accommodations for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances</a>. <br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation for a missed assessment is approved</u>, the student is responsible for contacting instructor to discuss accommodation arrangements. The instructor will determine the appropriate accommodation.<br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation is approved regarding a missed final exam</u>, the student needs to consult with the course instructor about writing a deferred final exam. In this case, the University of Waterloo Incomplete (INC) grade process will be followed, where all course requirements are not completed during the term. It is important to understand that, particularly with a cooperative education program, it is possible a deferred writing date will not be perfectly convenient to the student. If necessary, a CEE representative may be able to assist a student in their communications with an employer, however, it is still the student’s responsibility to initiate and manage any such process. Other than in exceptional circumstances, students are expected to prioritize writing the exam and completing the course (including making necessary arrangements for time away from work and being on campus). At the end of the current term, students will receive an INC course grade. Once the final exam has been written, a grade revision will be submitted based on the results of the final exam and other course work. Failure to write the final exam at the next SAF identified opportunity will result in a course grade based on the elements of the course that were completed. </p><p>If a student does not utilize one of the indicated approved methods that can justify missing an assessment (and receive some sort of accommodation) or if the request through the VIF or Extenuating Circumstances System is not approved, the student will receive 0 for that course element missed. <br/><br/>It is important to understand and properly utilize the appropriate process. Indicating that someone did not know of a process will not be an accepted justification.</p><h3>Declaring absences</h3><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness</strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h3>Recording lecture</h3><p>Most courses will be delivered as in person lectures. In such circumstances courses will not automatically record lectures. Permission from the instructor is required prior to recording of lectures. When permission is granted the use of all course recordings is strictly limited to the purpose of private/personal study and for no other reason (e.g., loaning the recording or reproducing a copy for another student, contesting grading, posting in whole or part online, etc.). Any failure to abide by these requirements is a violation of the university's academic integrity requirements and is subject to proceedings under Policy 71, Student Discipline.   </p><h3>Attendance at the Registered Section</h3><p>You are assigned to a specific section for instructor grading and office hours.  If you require a change, please contact an SAF Advisor. It is not appropriate to attend a session you are not enrolled in, without talking to the instructor first.</p>
