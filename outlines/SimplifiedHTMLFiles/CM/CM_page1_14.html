<p>Aside from the one midterm, this class is entirely hybrid. The lectures and the tutorials will be recorded over Zoom and posted on the course Learn page.</p><p>Manim, a Python library that makes math animations, will be taught over the tutorials starting in Week 3. Starting in Assignment 2, there will be Manim-specific questions in the assignments and midterm that grad students (STAT 842, CM 762) are expected to answer. STAT 442 students are welcome to come to tutorials, but cannot receive marks for Manim-specific questions.</p>

<p>Activities for this course involve recording, in partial fulfillment of the course learning outcomes. You will receive notification of recording via at least one of the following mechanisms: within the Learning Management System (LEARN), a message from your course instructor, course syllabus/website, or other means. Some technologies may also provide a recording indicator. Images, audio, text/chat messaging that have been recorded may be used and/or made available by the University to the instructional team and students of Stat 442 / Stat 842 / CM 762 for the purpose of instruction. Recordings will be managed according to the University records classification scheme, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/records-management/records-classification-and-retention-schedules"><u>WatClass</u></a>, and will be securely destroyed when no longer needed by the University. Your personal information is protected in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31"><u>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</u></a>, as well as <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/privacy/"><u>University policies and guidelines</u></a> and may be subject to disclosure where required by law.</p><p>The University will use reasonable means to protect the security and confidentiality of the recorded information, but cannot provide a guarantee of such due to factors beyond the University’s control, such as recordings being forwarded, copied, intercepted, circulated, disclosed, or stored without the University’s knowledge or permission or the introduction of malware into computer system which could potentially damage or disrupt the computer, networks, and security settings. The University is not responsible for connectivity/technical difficulties or loss of data associated with your hardware, software or Internet connection.</p><p>By engaging in course activities that involve recording, you are consenting to the use of your appearance, image, text/chat messaging, and voice and/or likeness in the manner and under the conditions specified herein. (In the case of a live stream event, if you choose not to have your image or audio recorded, you may <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-it-services/"><u>disable the audio and video functionality</u></a>. Instructions to participate using a pseudonym instead of your real name are included where the feature exists; however, you must disclose the pseudonym to your instructor in advance in order to facilitate class participation.) If you choose not to be recorded, this notice serves as confirmation of your understanding that questions can also be asked in office hours and on Piazza to avoid the possibility of a voice recording.</p><p>You are not permitted to disclose the link to/URL of an event or an event session recording or copies of recording to anyone, for any reason. Recordings are available only to authorized individuals who have been directly provided the above instructions/link for their use. Recordings for personal use, required to facilitate your learning and preparation of personal course/lecture notes, should not be shared with others without the permission of the instructor or event coordinator.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<ol><li><strong>Remark Requests:</strong> You may appeal the way an assignment/midterm was marked by submitting it to me <strong>mj2davis@uwaterloo.ca</strong> within 1 week of it being returned. Your email must include a completed Remark Request Form. Please find the form and full details of the process posted on LEARN.</li><li>Late Penalties: A late penalty of <strong>20% per day late, up to a maximum of three days</strong> will be applied to assignments for late submissions to Crowdmark. Please do not email us if you have technical issues that cause your submission to be a few minutes late. No waiving of this penalty will occur for technical issues. Instead, we encourage you to plan in advance and submit your assignments earlier than the moment of the deadline.</li><li>Illness: If you are ill, you must submit a VIF indicating severe illness. (If you are self-isolating due to flu-like or COVID-19 symptoms, you can instead complete the self-declaration form in Quest). Details can be found here: https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations<ul><li>If you are ill for a midterm, you must provide satisfactory documentation within 48 hours by emailing an electronic copy of the VIF to the Instructional Support Coordinator (ISC) as well as submitting to the MUO (or email the ISC in addition to completing the self-declaration). For satisfactory documentation, the weight of the test will be shifted to the final exam.</li><li>If you are ill for the final exam, you will receive an INC grade and be required to complete the exam during the next course offering, if you are achieving a passing grade going into the exam. Further, you must have written at least one of the two midterms to receive an INC. If not, a failing grade of DNW will be assigned.</li></ul></li><li>If at any time you are feeling sick, or have been directed by public health to self-isolate, you should not be attending class. We encourage you to get the lecture notes from a classmate or from a recording on Learn, but if needed please email your instructor directly and we will determine an appropriate accommodation for the situation.</li></ol><h3><strong>Mental Health Support</strong></h3><p>The Faculty of Math encourages students to seek out mental health support if needed.</p><p>On-campus Resources:</p><ul><li>Campus Wellness <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</a></li><li>Counselling Services: counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca/ 519-888-4567 ext 32655</li><li>MATES: one-to-one peer support program offered by Federation of Students (FEDS) and Counselling Services: mates@uwaterloo.ca</li><li>Health Services: located across the creek from the Student Life Centre, 519-888-4096.</li></ul><p>Off-campus Resources:</p><ul><li>Good2Talk (24/7): Free confidential help line for post-secondary students.

Phone: 519-884-0000 extension 213</li></ul><h4><strong>Personal Mental Health Support Message</strong></h4><p><strong>You're not alone.</strong> Lots of people look like they have it together in public and online when they're a mess inside too. You're not the only student facing what you're facing, and it really is okay to seek out help from the above sources if you need.</p><p><strong>Getting help is not an admission of failure.</strong> For the same reason that you cannot walk off a broken leg or a heart attack. It's just a thing that some people need to do.</p><p><strong>It probably gets better.</strong> Obviously, nobody can guarantee that, but it is extremely likely to get better. More specifically, you get stronger and more capable at dealing with the problems in your life.</p><p><strong>You are not your grades.</strong> Grades are not a reflection of your worth as a human being. They got you into university, so they've already done most of the work, but at this point, the most they can really do for you decide if you can get into graduate school before doing industry experience. (And if you're in the graduate version of this class, then congrats! You barely need grades at all now.)</p><p><strong>This too will pass.</strong> Some people will say that being a student was the best time of their life. Don't let that be your reason for thinking this is as good as it gets. Everyone's life path is different.</p><p><strong>Every day's 'best' is a little different.</strong> If you could do your theoretical best every day, then it wouldn't be your best it would be your average.</p><p><strong>Others are not yardsticks.</strong> The takeaway message is NOT 'if they can become a prof with a mental illness, then I should be able to as well.', please don't use others as a point of comparison like that.</p><p><strong>Take care of yourself when you can, don't blame yourself when you can't.</strong></p><p><strong>The world is better with you in it.</strong></p><h4><strong>Diversity and AccessAbility</strong></h4><p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, and that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class. We recognize the immense value of the diversity in identities, perspectives, and contributions that students bring, and the benefit it has on our educational environment. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In particular:</p><p>We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternate/preferred name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the semester so I may make appropriate changes to the records.</p><p>We will honour your religious holidays and celebrations. Please inform me of these at the start of the course.</p><p>We will follow AccessAbility Services guidelines and protocols on how to best support students with different learning needs. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility at the beginning of each academic term</p><h4><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo, including items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof)</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course</li><li>Questions or solution sets from any type of assessment</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work used by the instructor with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Sharing this intellectual property without the owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository). Permission is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><h4> </h4><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Recommendations for how to cite GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.

<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
