<h4>Assignments (20%)</h4><p>There will be three assignments worth 6.66% each to be turned in via Crowdmark (and LEARN; see Software section below).</p><p>The lateness penalty will be 25% per day until the solutions are posted.  Once the solutions are posted, the assignment will not be graded.</p><p>If you submit your assignment to Crowdmark on time, but you do so incorrectly in any way (e.g., you upload your Question 3 solution in the Question 1 box), you will receive a 5% deduction (i.e., 5% of the assignment’s point total will be deducted from your point total).</p><p>You may work on assignments in groups, and you may use any external resources. However, you <strong>must include the names of all collaborators and cite all external sources</strong>. Moreover, each individual’s assignment <strong>must differ substantively from others’ work</strong>. Failure to follow these instructions will be treated as an Academic Integrity violation (see below).</p><p>If you fail to submit an assignment by the due date and have a <strong>valid reason with supporting documentation</strong> (see Missed Assessments section below), the weight from that assignment will be shifted to the final exam. Note that a valid reason requires for you to have been incapacitated for a majority of the timeframe between the assignment's release date and due date.  In the case of a 2-day self-declared absence (see below), a 2-day extension will be provided.</p><h4>Midterms (30%)</h4><p>There will be two closed-book midterms worth 15% each on the following dates:</p><ul><li>Midterm 1: Thursday February 6</li><li>Midterm 2: Tuesday March 18</li></ul><p>The midterms will be during class time (10-11:30am) in STC 1012.</p><p>If a test is missed due to a valid reason with supporting documentation, your test score will be imputed from your score on the final exam as follows.  Whatever quantile of the final grade distribution you receive, your score for the test will be the same quantile on the test score distribution.  So for example, if your score is the 75% quantile on the final exam, then your test score will be the 75% quantile of the test score distribution.  Relative to simply shifting a missed test's weight to the final exam, this ensures that students who miss a test are not unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged if the final exam is much easier or harder than the missed test.</p><p>There are no make-up midterms in this course.</p><h4>Final Exam (50%)</h4><p>There will be a 2.5-hour, closed book, cumulative final exam during the Winter 2025 Final Examination Period:<strong> April 9 – April 25</strong>. Please refrain from booking end-of-term travel before the actual exam date is scheduled.</p><p>If the final exam is missed for a valid reason with supporting documentation, an Incomplete (INC) grade will be granted if:</p><ol><li>Either both midterms or one midterm and two assignments have been completed.</li><li>The student's average grade on the completed assessments is at least 50%.</li></ol><p>Otherwise, a missed final exam will result in an grade of "Did Not Write" (DNW), which counts as a final grade of 32 in transcript averages.</p><p>There is no make-up final exam in this course.</p>

<div>
<h4>Course Website</h4><p>The LEARN website for this course is <a href="http://learn.uwaterloo.ca">http://learn.uwaterloo.ca</a> (log in using your Quest userid and password). Course announcements, updates, assignments, solutions, hand-outs, grades, etc. will be posted here. It is your responsibility to keep up-to-date with the information on the website.</p><h4>Discussion Board</h4><p>To facilitate discussions during this course, a Piazza Q&amp;A forum will be used.  Please self-enroll at <a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/stat441841cm763">https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/stat441841cm763</a>.  All questions of general interest -- pertaining to the material, assessments, logistics, etc -- should be posted there.  Please do not send content questions via email. You can send a Piazza private message to the instructor/TAs (include all of us) if your question reveals part of an assignment solution. Students are encouraged to respond to questions and help each other. It is expected that everyone to be respectful to each other: any post that does not meet the principles in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33">Policy 33: Ethical Behavior</a> will be removed and the appropriate disciplinary body for Academic Integrity violations will be notified (see below).  You can generally expect a response from TAs within two business days.</p><h4>Software</h4><p>Material and assignments will require the use of R and Python programming languages, as well as the technical document writing programs for these languages: R Markdown and Quarto.  In addition to submitting PDF versions of the assignments on Crowdmark, you may be asked to submit the source files (Rmd, Qmd, etc.) on LEARN.</p><h4>Regrades</h4><p>You have 7 days after an assessment is handed back to request a regrade.  To do so, send an email to the marker with a written explanation of why you think you deserve a different mark.  Bear in mind that the entire assessment is then subject to be regraded.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assessment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><h4>Missed Assessments</h4><p>Valid reasons for missing an assessment are described on the Faculty of Mathematics' <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/absence-declarations">absence declarations webpage</a>.  Please familiarize yourself with this webpage as it explains exactly how and when different absences must be declared and how to submit proper documentation for them.</p><p>Absence declarations must be submitted online (on Quest or Absence Database; see website above) <i>and</i> via email to the instructor <strong>within 48 hours of the missed assessment deadline</strong>.</p><h4>Email</h4><p>Please use email only for questions of a personal nature.  Questions about course content will be directed to the Piazza Discussion Forum.  </p><p>The following standard of professionalism is required to obtain an email response:</p><ul><li>The email is sent from your UW email address.</li><li>Required salutation: "Hi Dr (or Professor) Lysy" or "Hi Martin".</li><li>Required signature: Your full name and student ID.</li></ul><p>Emails which do not adhere to this standard will generally be ignored.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>The Faculty of Math encourages students to seek out mental health support if needed.  </p><p>On-campus Resources:  </p><ul><li>Campus Wellness: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</u></a></li><li>Counselling Services: <a href="mailto:counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca/"><u>counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> 519-888-4567 ext. 32655</li><li>Health Services: located across the creek from the Student Life Centre, 519-888-4096.</li></ul><p>Off-campus Resources:    </p><ul><li>Good2Talk (24/7): Free confidential help line for post-secondary students.

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
