<p>This course is meant to provide you with a basic introduction to physical chemistry as applied to the life sciences with emphasis on applications in biochemistry. Physical chemistry has always played, and continues to play, an important role in biochemistry, as it provides a quantitative framework within which many aspects of biological structure, function, dynamics, energetics, kinetics and processes can be rationalized and understood. The answers to questions concerning the structure of DNA, the folding of proteins, and the metabolism of cells and organisms are all intimately connected to techniques, theories and models that are derived from physical chemistry. This course will cover the basics of thermodynamics and their applications to biological molecules and systems, their transport properties, chemical and enzyme kinetics, and physical techniques used to establish and investigate the structures of biological macromolecules.</p><p>I have taught this course previously many years ago, so this will be a fresh journey for me as well as you. As this is new material, this outline may need to be revised during the term, and I will alert you to any changes. I will aim to provide you with all the background necessary to cover the many topics in this course, from entropy and thermodynamic principles from the 18th century to modern applications such as AI which resulted in half of the the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry going to Google's DeepMind leaders Demis Hassabis and John Jumper for their development of AlphaFold, a protein structure database (of 220 million structures!). In return you should have some familiarity with the basics of biochemistry and biological structures and terminology, as well as some comfort working with derivatives, including partial derivatives, integrals and differential equations. You will need this background to succeed in this course, hence the prerequisites listed in the course description.</p><p>I have also created a group for us on Microsoft Teams, that you can access here:</p><p><a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3A-X_l-fWZfxy5jaISx64cpUNPQQbL_kF8GMiPYXxVuYM1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=5fb25bc6-45fe-46ee-863d-a71f3aec7e63&amp;tenantId=723a5a87-f39a-4a22-9247-3fc240c01396">CHEM 357 - Winter 2025 | General | Microsoft Teams</a></p><p>I will use this as an alternate resource for course files, just in case there are issues with access to LEARN at any stage through the term. Please use this, in an open group discussion, for any questions you have about course content. If you have questions for me regarding a personal request or need, please message me directly on Teams and not through the group. You can find my contact via the group on Teams.    </p>

<h2>
  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>This is the approximate schedule for the course. There will be online and in-class assignments, on a rotating interval of about two weeks. The schedule is subject to change, depending on how much progress we make through the term - we may take a little longer than 6 weeks to cover the first three sections. The midterm will occur on a Wednesday, likely Feb 26 during class time. It will cover everything we have been able to complete before the February Break. The final exam will cover the entire course and will be scheduled and administered by the Registrar's office. It will occur in a 2.5 hour time slot sometime between April 9 and April 25 (I have no control over this scheduling). Formats of the midterm and exam will be communicated closer to their dates.</p><p>Weeks 1 to 3:   Thermodynamics, its Laws and its Applications</p><p>Weeks 4 to 5:   Physical Equilibria and Phases; Membranes; Colligative Properties</p><p>Week 6:             Electrochemistry and Biological Redox Reactions </p><p>               --- <i> February Break Week ---</i></p><p>Week 7:             Transport Properties: Diffusion, Sedimentation, Electrophoresis</p><p>Weeks 8 to 9:    Kinetics, Chemical and Enzyme; Competition and Inhibition                     </p><p>Week 10:            Biomolecular Structure; Optical Spectroscopy</p><p>Weeks 11 to 12: NMR Spectroscopy; X-ray Diffraction; AI Methods and AlphaFold          </p>

<p>As there are several assignments and quizzes within these categories, an absence due to illness will be accommodated by scaling the remaining elements of that category of assessment. If you miss the midterm, the final exam will be worth 50% of your mark. If you miss the final exam, a makeup exam will need to be taken at the next offering of the course, in Winter 2026.</p>
