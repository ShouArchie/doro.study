<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen some postlab assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.<br/>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>ASSIGNMENT POLICIES</strong></p><ul><li>All prelab due dates in this course are firm; short answer prelab due dates are listed on the course schedule. Other prelab due dates are listed below.</li><li>All short answer prelab assignments submitted on Crowdmark are due at 11:59 pm (23:59) EST on the due date as per the course schedule.</li><li>All auto-graded prelab assignments are on Mobius and due at 1:30 pm the day of your experiment.</li><li>The plan of action for each unit is due the first day you plan to start that unit.</li><li>Prelab notebook work for each unit is due the first day you plan to start that unit.</li><li>Postlab assignments are due at the start of your scheduled lab period the week they are due*.</li><li>*Each student will receive 4 flexible submission days for postlab assignments. What does this mean? During the term you have 4 days that can be used to submit a postlab after the due date. Each day is worth 24 hours; days cannot be portioned (i.e., cannot have 2 “half” days). Flexible submission days can be used separately or together. For example, you could have 4 x 1-day extensions throughout the term OR you could have 2 x 1-day and a 1 x 2-day extension throughout the term, etc. Rules for using flexible submission days:</li><li>All work in this course is completed individually unless otherwise stated. While students may discuss ideas with each other, excessive collaboration, copying other students work (former and present), using online sources such as Chegg and Course Hero, and file sharing all violate Policy 71. Students suspected of violating Policy 71 will be reported to the Science Integrity Team in the Science UG Office.</li><li>Illness on the day something is due does not exempt you from the due date as there is ample time to complete the tasks in advance for this course.</li><li>If you have an outstanding circumstance, then please contact the instructor as soon as possible, ideally before the deadline. Students who are unable to complete graded tasks due to outstanding circumstance will generally be exempted from that task (increasing the weight of other assessment items). Extensions will rarely be granted outside of flexible submission days for postlab assignments. Please note that verification is always required for an exemption.</li><li><strong>Computer problems will generally not be accepted as an excuse for late submission. Please be aware that computer problems can always arise unexpectedly. As such, you need to plan accordingly to avoid late submissions (i.e., avoid submitting at the last minute). If a computer problem arises then email the instructor as soon as possible and include any documentation that illustrates the task was completed on time. </strong></li><li>Assignments not submitted before the deadline will receive a grade of zero, however, you will still receive feedback for lab planning, performance, and exam purposes.</li><li>Copied assignments or portions of assignments, including structures drawn using ChemDraw or by hand, will receive a mark of zero and be reviewed by the associate Dean of Science and Engineering. This includes copying previous or current assignments. Please read Policy 71 – Student Academic Discipline Policy for other academic offenses.</li><li>Each student only has maximum 4 flexible submission days during the term. Once they are used up, there are no more.</li><li>The latest a postlab can be submitted is on a Friday at 2:30 in any given week, as TA’s need time to grade them.</li><li>When a student is using a flexible submission day, they must inform the instructor by email the day the postlab is due and state how many flexible days they will be using. The instructor will then confirm the new due date and where they postlab is to be submitted (generally directly to the grading TA).</li><li>Once a student has selected the number of flexible grading days they need, this becomes the new due date, and no grading days can be added. Failure to submit by the new due date will constitute a zero on the assignment.</li><li>Some postlab assignments can be submitted as a group. If flexible submission days are used for a group assignment; all group members must agree as these days are applied to each group member. Group members cannot “borrow” other group members flexible submission days.</li><li>The instructor will keep track of all students flexible submission days; you can inquire as to how many you have at any time during the term.</li></ul><p><strong>MISSED LABS AND ILLNESS POLICIES</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Attendance is mandatory</strong>.</li><li>If for any <strong>valid</strong> reason you cannot show up to your regularly scheduled session, you should contact the instructor and make alternative arrangements <strong>prior</strong> to the lab period. It is often difficult to schedule make-up labs, however, the instructor will give you all available options possible to avoid missing an experiment.</li><li>Students who miss laboratory sessions without a valid excuse will not be permitted to do the experiment and will be assigned a mark of zero for the corresponding postlab assignment, lab notebook, and lab performance.</li><li><i><strong>Illness and Short-Term Absence Policies:</strong></i></li><li>Anyone feeling ill during the term should stay home. Please contact the instructor as soon as possible to let them know. Proceed with the appropriate healthcare guidelines as recommended at that time.</li><li>Students missing labs due to illness need to obtain a verification of illness (VIF) and submit it to the Science Undergraduate Office.</li><li>Students are allowed to self-declare an illness related to Covid-19 once per academic term (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-my-illness">Self Declaration Link</a>). It is important to still contact the instructor for this type of illness.</li><li>Students can not use the 48-hour short term absence to miss a laboratory session. This absence should also not be used to miss prelab work (i.e., prelab assignment) as this is required to attend the lab session.</li></ul><p><strong>ARRIVING LATE TO THE LAB</strong></p><ul><li>It is important that the lab start on time and that you are present for the prelab talk. Therefore, there will be lab performance penalties for students arriving late the lab on a sliding scale.</li><li>If you know you will be late for any VALID reason, please let the instructor know BEFORE the lab period.</li></ul><p><strong>ASSESSMENT AND GRADES</strong></p><p>There are many assessments in this course. When you receive a grade, please take the time to look it over and read through the feedback. If you have questions about the grading or feedback, please see the list below for whom you should contact.</p><ul><li>Online prelab questions: course instructor.</li><li>Lab notebook, lab performance, prelab assignments, postlab assignments: the grading TA should be contacted first; if the concern is not resolved, then please contact the course instructor.</li></ul><p>Assessments that are graded by a TA should be discussed with the grading TA first. It is important that if a mistake has been made, the TA be given the opportunity to correct it. If you are not satisfied with the TA’s decision you may speak to the instructor. The instructor will consider all grading concerns; however, grade changes will require the instructor to re-grade the assessment in question in its entirety. If you choose to have the instructor re-grade any assessment, the mark you receive from the instructor will be your final mark. </p><p><strong>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</strong></p><ul><li>To maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.</li><li>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for his/her actions. Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.</li><li>A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean.</li><li>For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/node/97">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.</li><li>For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/node/131">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>EXPECTATION OF STUDENTS IN THE LAB</strong></p><p>Welcome to the chemistry synthesis laboratory. Below is a summary of our expectations of you, the student, while taking a lab course with us. </p><ul><li>We expect that all students arrive to the lab <u>on time</u> and <u>prepared</u> for the experiment that day.  We expect you to have completed all required prelab tasks and clarified anything that you are unsure about. Key aspects of the experiment will be outlined on the whiteboards located in the lab as well as in any pre-lab talks given. Since we expect you to arrive prepared, the instructor will not spend copious amounts of time repeating the information that you should already know.</li><li>We expect you to always follow lab safety, policies and basic lab techniques as outlined in this course. This creates a safe atmosphere for everyone in the lab: students, TA’s and instructors alike.</li><li>We expect you to ask questions during the lab period about <u>anything</u> you do not understand.</li><li>We expect you to take <u>responsibility</u> for not being aware of the information provided or not being prepared for the lab experiment and <u>accepting</u> the corresponding <u>consequences</u>.</li><li>This lab operates on treating <u>everyone equally and fairly</u> and thus <u>no</u> exceptions will be made to any of the policies listed in this handout.</li></ul><p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></p><ul><li>Think ahead, plan and prepare for the experiment.</li><li>Students must attend the section they are assigned to based on QUEST.</li><li>Students who wish to switch their assigned lab session dates must find a student to switch with before contacting the instructor. Please do not attempt to switch anything yourself (i.e. drop and add via Quest) as instructor consent is required.</li><li>Students will generally work in pairs in the lab, though some students may be able to work individually depending on enrollment numbers. Students can only pair up with a student from their lab section. Students that cannot find a partner before the first lab session will be assigned a partner at the start of the first lab session.</li><li>Students will be assigned to a locker the first lab session and continue working in that location throughout the term. Lockers contain most glassware and equipment needed in the lab.</li><li>It is students responsibility to avoid damaging or breaking glassware and any equipment used in the lab. Damaged or broken glassware/equipment during the lab period will have to replaced at your cost (lab glassware breakages are not covered by your tuition).</li><li>Glassware and equipment must be cleaned after use (please refer to basic lab techniques for glassware cleaning procedures). Glassware not cleaned properly will result in loss of lab performance marks.</li><li>It is important that the lab start on time and that you are present for the prelab talk. Therefore, there will be lab performance penalties for students arriving late the lab on a sliding scale.</li><li>If you know you will be late for any VALID reason, please let the instructor know BEFORE the lab period.</li></ul><p> </p>
