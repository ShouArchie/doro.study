<p>This laboratory course is designed to complement the content of lecture course CHEM 233 through a series of selected experiments. The goal of this laboratory course is to have the students gain exposure to and experience with basic biochemistry lab techniques including (but not restricted to) the use of a pH-meter, the execution of a chemical titration, the use of electrophoresis equipment, the execution of a variety of column chromatography techniques, methods for accurate volume transfer, treatment of experimental data and the operation of a UV/Vis spectrophotometer. The set of individual labs comprising the course explore the following themes with the aim of reinforcing concept understanding: the behaviour of buffers, different approaches for the isolation and quantitative determinations of biomolecules, the fundamentals of Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics and the use of various techniques for the purposes of amino acid and protein separation and identification.</p><p>Students will work in pairs this term, unless social distancing restrictions are instated. There is no textbook for this course. All laboratory content and material outlining all experimental procedures, equipment operation and theory, safety practices, report formats and data treatment is available online on the CHEM 233L LEARN course website.</p>

<p><strong>Attendance: </strong>CHEM 233L requires your attendance for every scheduled lab period. Missing a lab session without valid documentation and notification of and acknowledgement by the lab instructor (travel is not a valid reason!) may result in an INC grade or a grade deduction of 10% from the final grade. Missing more than one lab regardless of reason will result in an INC grade.</p><p><strong>Lab Reports: </strong>There will be six main <strong>informal lab reports </strong>that will make up a total of <strong>48% </strong>of your grade<strong>. </strong>The lab reports will include a brief summary of the experiment performed, data analysis and answers to concept-based questions. These lab reports must be typed, including calculations.</p><p>All Informal lab report submissions are <strong>before your next scheduled lab period at 2:30 pm</strong>, unless notified by the instructor ahead of time. Lab reports are to be submitted <strong><u>TWICE</u></strong>, once as<strong> <u>one PDF file</u> </strong>into the <strong>Dropbox on LEARN</strong> and the other using <strong>Crowdmark</strong>.<strong> </strong>Students should consult the Laboratory Schedule provided on LEARN for specific dates. </p><p>There are two<strong> mini-lab reports, </strong>each making up <strong>3.5%</strong> of your grade. These mini reports are due at the end of their respective lab time. Information regarding the mini-report will be provided on LEARN ahead of time so that you can prepare for them. </p><p><strong><u>Late</u> lab</strong> reports shall receive a<strong> <u>deduction of 10% per day </u></strong><u>from the denominator value</u> up until 3 days post due date.<strong>*</strong></p><p><strong>*Exception </strong>to late policy: <strong>No lates accepted for the Module 7 report </strong>since they need to be graded in a timely manner before the exam.<strong>  </strong></p><p><strong>**<u>REPORTS RECEIVED MORE THAN THREE DAYS AFTER THE DUE DATE WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.**</u></strong></p><p><strong>Pre-lab quizzes </strong>(this is different from the pre-lab assignments that you will be required to do) will be administered online through LEARN Quiz Tool. Pre-lab quizzes are based on the experimental procedure, equipment and calculations needed to complete the experiment. The videos can be found on LEARN. Pre-lab quizzes will be <strong>open-book</strong> and make up a total of <strong>8% </strong>of your final grade. </p><p>Your <strong>Performance</strong> in the lab for each experiment will be assessed weekly and will make up a total of <strong>12%</strong> of your final grade. The lab performance grade component will be evaluated individually for each student and will consider the following criteria: completed <u>pre-lab preparations (including pre-lab assignments found under the Quiz Tool on LEARN</u>; readiness to proceed with the experiment at the start of the lab, organization (of space, time and thought), lab technique (proper pipetting, recording of data, etc.), equitable division of labour between partners, adherence to safety practices and lab rules, tidiness of individual work space and care taken to keep common areas clean and orderly. <strong>Students who arrive late and/or are not ready to leave the lab within the time frame of the laboratory period will receive a zero (0) for the performance component of that lab. </strong></p><p><strong>Pre-lab assignments, </strong>as mentioned above, make up a portion of you performance grade. These assignments will ensure that you come prepared with correct calculations and appropriate formatted tables for recording your data. These submissions will be <strong>due on the Monday before your lab session at 12 pm (noon)</strong>. When submitting to the Quiz tool on LEARN, you may either write up your pre-lab assignment in your lab book, take a photo of it and then submit it as your response, <u>OR</u> you may type it up online and then print out a copy and secure it (tape/staple) in your lab book.  <strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Lab Books</strong>: The ability to collect data in a clear and orderly manner is a skill that you must develop. In this laboratory course, <strong>a bound hard cover notebook</strong> will be used. Use this notebook to plan your experiments ahead of time by <strong>providing a flowchart</strong> of the tasks to be completed and the pre-lab assignment, in addition to <strong>recording your data </strong>(including both experimental measurements and conditions) in a logical fashion along with any pertinent observations and/or comments. Lab books should be kept neat and organized. Always record experimental observations in tabular form whenever possible and be sure to use <strong>INK</strong> for all notebook records. Use complete explicit headings and make certain all numerical values are accompanied by appropriate units. Ensure that the raw data collected is reviewed and initialed by a teaching assistant on the day the data is collected prior to leaving the lab. Saving your data in an electronic form (USB) is allowed as a backup but should not be done in lieu of recording your data in your lab book. <strong>You will be required to submit your lab book for grading on your last day in the lab. </strong>Your lab book grade will make up<strong> 5% </strong>of your total grade.<strong> </strong>In order to stress the daily recording and maintenance of your lab book, surprise graded checks may occur during any one lab period. </p><p>The following <strong>notebook features </strong>will be allotted marks:            </p><ul><li>table of contents</li><li>pages numbered</li><li>entries dated</li><li>entry for each lab week (include flowchart/procedural summary and recorded data)</li><li>use of ink and no liquid paper</li><li>TA initials on raw data</li><li>pre-lab notes</li><li>meaningful labels for all data entered and use of units</li><li>descriptive observations</li><li>overall flow and appearance</li></ul><p>You do not need to copy the procedure I have provided on Learn into your lab book - only procedural deviations throughout your experiment. </p><p>The <strong>final lab exam</strong> will be no longer than a 2 hour examination of your understanding of the CHEM 233L laboratory course content. Questions will be based on all of the work conducted, as well as all reference material provided on LEARN. The grade obtained on the final lab exam will make up <strong>20%</strong> of the final grade.<strong> </strong>The final exam will take place on the<strong> last scheduled lab period. </strong><i><u>**A grade of less than 40% on the final lab exam will result in re-evaluation of your overall grade and can lead to a failure grade or a final grade of 50%.**</u>  </i>Student travel plans are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time. </p><p>In the <strong>event of illness</strong>, or for other legitimate reasons, <strong>contact the Laboratory Instructor</strong> as soon as possible to discuss the possibility of alternate arrangements. Accommodations will only be considered with a verified Verification of Illness Forms (<strong>VIF</strong>), counselling letters, interview confirmations, etc. </p><p><strong>In the event that a student becomes ill: </strong></p><ul><li>Please follow the instructions found on the Science Undergraduate Office page for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">SUO illness accommodations</a>.</li><li>If your validated illness causes the inability to attend and/or complete your scheduled lab section, you should always inform the instructor at the earliest time possible. An alternate arrangement or schedule may be discussed between you and the instructor. <i>Note: this only applies of you are ill and verified and agreed upon by you and the instructor.</i> An INC or IP grade will be assigned if one-two lab sessions are missed (in attendance). Missing three or more lab sessions will result in a grade of 32%.</li><li>If your validated illness causes your inability to attend or complete <strong>the lab exam</strong> an INC or IP grade will be assigned and/or you may be asked to write it during a makeup exam session or with the next term offering. CHEM 233L is offered only in the - Winter and Spring terms.</li></ul><p>If by chance, a circumstance occurs that is not mentioned in the policy above, an alternative sensible arrangement will be made between the instructor and student/s. Any concerns you have with this policy should be addressed to the instructor, Harmeen Deol.</p><p><strong>All unclaimed student submissions will be destroyed at the end of the term in which the submissions were made.</strong></p><p>***Occasionally, once the term gets under way, a situation will arise which requires an experimental procedure to be modified. If it becomes necessary to modify a laboratory protocol after laboratory manuals have been distributed, the revised procedure will be posted on the LEARN course site.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Turnitin</h4><p>In the biochemistry lab, all lab reports must be written on an individual basis. While you and your partner will, on occasion, share the same raw data, all processed data, calculations and graphs should be unique to each individual. Plagiarism (to any extent) will not be tolerated. Anyone in possession of an old lab report will receive a mark of zero for that experiment. Copied lab reports will receive a mark of zero. Anyone suspected of plagiarism will be penalized. Plagiarism and copying infractions apply to students taking the course in the same term as well as previous year’s reports. All cases will be reported to the associate Dean of Science.  </p><p><i>To ensure academic integrity, CHEM233L will employ the use of <u>Turnitin</u>. Students will be required to submit an electronic copy of their report to the Turnitin <u>dropbox</u> on the CHEM233L LEARN course website. An “originality report” and “AI detection score" will be generated for each report submitted. </i></p><p><i>NOTE: Turnitin is also capable of detecting AI (Artificial intelligent) generated text. </i></p><p><i>Students have a right to decline the use of Turnitin. Students who wish to opt out of submitting electronic versions of their reports to Turnitin must notify the instructor at the beginning of the term. In such cases, an alternative option will be made </i></p><p>For detailed information regarding academic integrity, please refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/current-undergraduate-students/academic-integrity">Faculty of Science Academic Integrity</a>.</p><p>  </p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.
