<h2>Learning Methods</h2><p><strong>Content Videos:  </strong>Throughout the content videos, the instructors will focus on selected topics from the course notes. Prepare for each video by reading the relevant sections of the course notes or text in advance.  You are expected to learn some of the course material on your own. </p><p><strong>Synchronous classes:  </strong>In your synchronous classes and tutorials your instructors and teaching assistants will review content and guide you through various problem-solving activities to help you apply your knowledge and skills to new problem-solving situations.</p><p><strong>Chemistry Study Hall:  </strong>Starting the 2nd week of classes, there will be a first-year study hall on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5:30 pm - 6:50 pm in STC 1012.  The study hall will be staffed with CHEM Teaching assistants and volunteer tutors for you to ask questions and get help for the course.  Note:  Even though your quest schedule indicates "CHEM 123 Tutorial", it is a placeholder for the Chem Study Hall.  You can attend as many Study Hall Sessions as you would like - grab your friends and connect with your TAs!</p><p><strong>Online Assignments:  </strong>The assignments are provided online so that you can obtain frequent and immediate feedback on your understanding of the concepts.  Each online assignment can be repeated up to three times, so you can correct your mistakes or get help.  If you earn a grade of 80.0% or higher on an online assignment it will be treated as 100% when calculating the assignment grades at the end of the term.  Historically, students who do the online assignments as scheduled earn higher grades than students who do not.</p><p><strong>Instructor Student Hours/Q&amp;A sessions:  </strong>During virtual or in-person drop-in Q&amp;A sessions, the instructors or teaching assistants will be available for “drop-in” question-and-answer interaction.  These Q&amp;A sessions may be held in person or online.  Further instructions will be given on LEARN.  </p><p><strong>Piazza Q&amp;A:  </strong>We use Piazza for questions for help from instructors, teaching assistants and classmates.  Using Piazza, you can post anonymously, publicly to the class, or privately to the instructors.  <strong>All course content questions are to be posted on the course Piazza boards (not sent by email) to ensure we can help you quickly and efficiently.</strong>  Instructors will recommend that all students post questions on the Piazza discussion boards instead of emailing instructors directly.</p><p><strong>Extra Practice Problems:</strong>  For each module, we have assigned problems for you to try (posted on LEARN).  You are not required to hand in solutions to these problems; the responsibility to do them is yours.</p>

<p><strong>Participation (10%):</strong> There are 9 participation components in CHEM 123.  We will count 7 of the 9 components, dropping the lowest two.</p><ul><li><strong>Eight Participation Challenges:</strong>  These are timed, single-attempt online quizzes scheduled approximately weekly. The quizzes are graded 25% for completion and 75% based on your earned grade. <strong>Submission policy:</strong> Participation Challenges must be completed by the indicated deadline. No extensions are permitted.</li><li><strong>One combined clicker grade:</strong>   Points are awarded for answering in-class clicker questions, which are not graded for correctness.   To earn full credit for your iClicker grade, you need to answer 75% of the total clicker questions.  Clicker grades over 75% will be adjusted to 100% at the end of the term.</li></ul><p>If you do not complete the participation components, or if your participation grades do not improve your overall grade, the 10% weight for participation will be transferred: 5% to your term test grades and 5% to your final exam grade. We calculate all grades with and without the participation component and only include the grade if it helps your overall grade. <strong>Please note:</strong> <strong>Because every student can drop two participation components, VIFs are not required or accepted for participation challenges.</strong></p><p><strong>Online Assignments (10%):</strong> Online assignments are posted on LEARN and deployed using the Mobius platform. We will count 8 of the 9 online assignments. You get three attempts for each assignment, and the highest earned grade is recorded. If you earn a grade of 80% or higher on an assignment, the mark will be treated as 100% when calculating your assignment average. This adjustment is done at the end of the term. If you choose not to do the assignments, the 10% weight for the assignments is transferred: 5% to your term test grades and 5% to your final exam grade. We calculate all grades with and without the assignment component and only include the grade if it helps your overall grade. <strong>Submission policy:</strong> Assignments must be completed by the due date. Each student may use up to 3 “grace days” for each assignment, after which no further submissions or extensions will be permitted.  CHEM 123 has flexible grading where one assignment is dropped for all students, and the weight of the assignments is shifted to the final exam if it does not help the overall grade.   For this reason, VIFs are not needed or accepted for missed online assignments.  </p><p><strong>Term Tests (40%):  </strong>There will be two tests in CHEM 123. Test 1 is on <strong>Wednesday, February 5<sup>th</sup>  </strong>and counts for 20% of the course grade.  Test 2 is on <strong>Wednesday, March 12<sup>th</sup> </strong> and counts for 20% of the course grade.  Details for each test will be posted on LEARN approximately one week in advance. <strong>Note: </strong>If you write both term tests, the weight of your lowest written test can be transferred to your final exam if it increases your overall grade.  This will be calculated automatically for you at the end of the term.  If you miss a test for a valid reason, the weight of the missed test will be transferred to the final exam.</p><p><strong>Final Exam (40%):</strong> There will be a cumulative final exam held during the exam period (April 9-25). Check the schedule posted by the Registrar’s Office:  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/exam-schedule">https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/exam-schedule</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>Important Note:  The grade calculation described above applies only if the weighted average of your tests and exam is at least 50%.  If the weighted average of your tests and exam is less than 50%, then that weighted average is also your course grade.</strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Why do we place extra emphasis on the weighted average of your tests and exam?</strong> Our experience, compiled over many years, indicates that low marks on the tests and exam are a very strong indicator that a student has not mastered the material.  The assignments are important because they will help you prepare for the tests and exam, so it is in your best interests to do them. Learn from your mistakes on the assignments before writing the tests or exam.</p><p><strong>Policy for Requests for Extra Credit or Grade Increases:</strong>  Please do not request extra marks at the end of the term from your course instructor either in person or by email.  Providing “extra credit” opportunities or arbitrarily increasing your grade is unethical and unfair to the rest of the class.  <strong>These requests will not be responded to by any of the course instructors. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
