<p><strong>Skills Test and Final Evaluation:</strong>  As part of the Learning Assessment for Chem 140, students are required to write a Skills Test on <strong>Tuesday, February 11, 2025</strong> and the Final Evaluation on <strong>Thursday, April 3, 2025</strong>.  Both the Skills Test and Final Evaluation will be designated a 2 hour time limit to complete.  Two time-slots will be will be available for the Skills Test and Final Evaluation: <strong>9:00 AM - 11:00 AM</strong> and<strong> 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM</strong>, Eastern Time.  To access the test, students must sign-up for one of the available time-slots, <strong>before Friday, January 31, 2025</strong>.  Please be aware that the University of Waterloo is located in the Eastern Time Zone ( UTC-5 during Standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time) and, as such, the scheduled times for these activities are based on this zone.  Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) starts March 9, 2025 and Eastern Standard Time (EST) starts November 2, 2025.</p><p><strong>Participation:</strong>  All students enrolled in CHEM 140 are expected to attempt and complete all CHEM 140 pre-lab exercises and in-class exercises..</p><p>If a student is unable to complete and/or submit an in-class exercise due to illness lasting more than seven (7) consecutive days, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the course instructor, by e-mail, preferably within 48 hours, but no more than 72 hours.  Have a medical practitioner complete a Verification of Illness Form (VIF).  Email a scanned copy of the VIF to the course instructor.  In your email to the course instructor, provide your name, UW student ID number, and exactly what course activity you missed.  A copy of the completed VIF must be submitted to the Science Undergraduate Office.  The dates of illness on the VIF must include the date the student was not able to complete the course activity, otherwise the VIF will be considered invalid and will not be accepted.  It is imperative that you contact the course instructor and Science Undergraduate Office as soon as you are well enough to do so.  Any student failing to provide a VIF within a reasonable time line, will receive a mark of zero for their pre-lab exercise and/or in-class exercise. The policy above applies to missing tests and exams due to illness.  <strong>A VIF in which the severity has been declared as “Covid-19-Related Self-Declaration” is not considered valid and will not be accepted as a reason for not participating in any CHEM 140 activities</strong>. Any student who is severally ill, which prevents them from participating in any CHEM 140 activity, should obtain a VIF from a medical practitioner. </p><p>CHEM 140 being a Laboratory (LAB) course, in accordance with University policy, a <strong>self-declared short-term absence</strong> option cannot be used and <strong>no special accommodation will be provided</strong>.</p><p>Any other reasons other than illness, such as travel plans, are not considered acceptable grounds for not completing a CHEM 140 pre‐lab exercise, in‐class exercise, term test, and/or final evaluation. Students are expected to make plans such that do not conflict with the CHEM 140 Course Schedule. Situations where alternative plans cannot be made, students must inform the course instructor <strong>within one week of the start of the academic term</strong>, so that alternative arrangements can be made. Students are required to submit a copy of any official supporting documentation before any special accommodations will be considered. Students should refer to the CHEM 140 Course Schedule, found on the CHEM 140 <strong>LEARN</strong> site, before scheduling any plans. This policy is applicable to CHEM 140 tests and exams.</p><p>For cases involving extenuating circumstances, the student must provide supporting documentation as to why they are unable to complete a CHEM 140 activity, such as pre‐lab exercises and/or in‐class exercises. Supporting documentation will be considered on a case by case basis. <strong>Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken</strong>. Examples of supporting documentation include plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates, obituaries, letters from funeral directors, or counselor letters. Student should contact the course instructor via email, as soon as possible. The email must include your name, UW student ID number, what course activity you missed, the dates you will not be able to participate in CHEM 140 due to the extenuating circumstances, and a legible copy of the supporting documentation. <u>Any student who fails to contact the course instructor in a timely manner, will not be extended any special consideration, regardless of the reason</u>. Students requiring more than two weeks to be excused from any Chem 140 activities will be required to submit additional supporting documentation, such as a counselor letter.</p><p>Students unable to complete more than three (3) Chem 140 in‐class exercises, due to illness or extenuating circumstances, will be strongly encouraged to withdraw their enrollment from the course. Only for special cases, should a student choose not to withdraw from the course, their final grade will be submitted as <strong>INC</strong> (Incomplete). Only in cases where the student has completed two thirds or more of the course will the option of an INC will be considered. An <strong>Incomplete Grade Agreement Form</strong> must be completed by the course instructor and submitted to the Registrars Office, no later than one week after the last day of classes.  In order to complete the form, a date of completion for the submission of all missed in-class exercises, tests, and exams must be mutually agreed upon between the student and course instructor.</p><p><strong>Pre-lab Exercises:</strong>  All CHEM 140 sessions have pre-lab exercises, which can be found on the CHEM 140 LEARN site. A minimum grade of 95% must be obtained on the pre-lab exercise.  The exercise data and exercise dropbox will not be accessible until a minimum grade of 95% is obtained on the pre-lab exercise.  The pre-lab exercises will be accessible for a period of one week.  Within the one week period, students will be allowed an unlimited number attempts at the pre-lab exercise, until a grade of 95% or higher is obtained. Pre-lab exercise due dates will be posted on LEARN with the pre-lab exercises.</p><p><strong>Electronic Submissions:</strong>  All in-class exercises must be submitted online to the designated CHEM 140 LEARN dropbox.  In-class exercise submissions consist of an Excel workbook (.xlsx) containing the calculations for the in-class exercise and a MS-Word document (.docx) containing the answers to the in-class exercise questions.  <strong>Documents saved in a Portable Document Format (PDF) will not be accepted and will receive a mark of zero (0)</strong>.  Failure to submit the required documents electronically will result in a mark of zero (0).  Upon successfully submitting the required in-class exercise documents, students will be sent a confirmation e-mail.  </p><p> It is the student's responsibility to ensure <strong>all the correct files</strong> were submitted to the LEARN dropbox.  If the wrong files were submitted and the LEARN dropbox has closed, the student must contact the course instructor as soon as possible.  If the required in-class exercise files were not submitted to the LEARN dropbox and/or some other documents were submitted by mistake, only in special circumstances, will the student be allowed to resubmit the correct files.  A student will be allowed to resubmit their in-class exercise files, only after the course instructor  can verify the in-class exercise files have not been modified since the last submission to the LEARN dropbox.  In some cases, at the discretion of the course instructor, a <strong>10-mark penalty</strong> may also be applied to the final grade of the in-class exercise.  If a student has not brought the issue of submitting the incorrect files to the attention of the course instructor within one week of the scheduled submission date, no re-submission will be allowed and the grade on the in-class exercise will stand as is.  In some cases, where it has been established a student has submitted the incorrect files due to carelessness, the student will not be allowed to resubmit the correct files, and the in-class exercise files submitted to the LEARN dropbox will be graded in accordance to the in-class exercise marking scheme.</p><p>Students should keep a copy of their electronic submissions, on some sort of external storage device (e.g. USB flash drive), until it is confirmed their in-class exercise has been graded.  If the uploaded files have been corrupted, it may be necessary for a student to re-submit the electronic copies of their files.  Remember, if we are unable to read your files, we are unable to grade your exercise.</p><p><strong>Extensions and Late Submissions:  </strong>In CHEM 140, extensions to complete an exercise will <strong>NEVER</strong> be granted, regardless of the reason.  Only in cases where illness or other extenuating circumstances have prevented a student from completing their exercise before the specified deadline, will the student be excused from completing the exercise.  Supporting documentation must be provided before any special accommodations will be considered.</p><p>As a rule, In Chem 140 <strong>late submissions of in-class exercises will not be accepted</strong>, regardless of the reason.  Students are given <strong>one week</strong> to complete the pre-lab exercise and in-class exercises for a given Chem 140 session.  Therefore, students are expected to manage their time wisely and allow ample time to complete all assignments before the specified deadline.</p><p>Late submission will only be accepted for certain circumstances where the course instructor deems it to be an acceptable reason.  A student must provide credible evidence that their in-class exercise was completed <strong>BEFORE</strong> the specified deadline.  Time stamps and submission logs will be checked to validate the student’s claim.  <strong>Submissions attempted to be made at or after the specified deadline will not be accepted</strong>. </p><p><strong>Dropbox Technical Difficulties:  </strong>If a technical difficulty is encountered while submitting an in-class exercise, it is imperative students promptly contact the course instructor via email. The email must include the in-class exercise Excel workbook and the Word document, <strong>sent as email attachments</strong>. Refrain from sending files as "links". Failure to include both the Excel workbook and Word document will result in the student’s request for assistance being disregarded. Additionally, if either the Excel workbook or Word document cannot be opened, a request for assistance will be declined.</p><p>To ensure integrity, time stamps and submission logs will be inspected to confirm that the Excel workbook and/or Word document have not been modified since the dropbox deadline.</p><p>Any reports of technical difficulties must be made promptly, within 10 minutes of the dropbox deadline.  Any reports of technical difficulties not made in a timely manner will not be considered.</p><p>It is important to note that missing the dropbox deadline does not constitute a technical difficulty. Therefore, any file <strong>saved at or after the specified dropbox deadline will not be accepted</strong>.</p><p><strong>In-Class Exercise Preparation:</strong>  Students are expected to prepare their CHEM 140 in-class exercises on an individual basis.  In-class exercises showing signs of excessive collaboration will be penalized.  Students submitting a CHEM 140 in-class exercise found to contain inconsistencies and discrepancies will be penalized.  Penalties will be decided by course instructor, taking into account the severity of the offense. In cases where a severe academic offence has been committed, a student will be reported to the Science Integrity Office  for disciplinary action.  Students must use data, including physical constants, provided in the CHEM 140 manual and/or on the CHEM 140 LEARN site.  For any questions requiring additional calculations, the Excel workbooks must be included with the in-class exercise.</p><p><strong>Re-grading In-Class Exercises:</strong>  If there is a concern related as to how an in-class exercise was graded, the student should first consult the teaching assistant responsible for grading the in-class exercise.  If a resolution between the student and teaching assistant cannot be found, the instructor will re-grade the entire in-class exercise, upon request of the student. The mark assigned by instructor will be final. Please refer to the <strong>Introduction</strong> section of the CHEM 140 Course Notes and Exercises manual for all rules and penalties associated with CHEM 140.</p><p><strong>Missing the Skills Test:  </strong>If a student is unable to write the Skills Test due to illness, the weight of the Skills Test (15%) will be transferred to the Final Evaluation.  <strong>There are no make-up Skills Test</strong>.</p><p><strong>Missing the Final Evaluation:</strong>  If a student is unable to write the Final Evaluation due to illness, a Makeup Final Evaluation will be arranged. <strong>It is the student's responsibility to contact the course instructor within 48 hours, but no more than 72 hours, to discuss the arrangements for writing a Makeup Final Evaluation</strong>.  Students must arrange a date with the course instructor to write a Make-up Final Evaluation <strong>before the end of the on-campus examination period</strong>.  In special cases, where a student is unable to write the Makeup Final Evaluation before the end of the on-campus examination period, it will be necessary to submit the student’s final grade as <strong>INC</strong> (Incomplete). An <strong>Incomplete Grade Agreement Form</strong> must be completed and the arrangements for the Makeup Final Evaluation will be recorded and the form will be sent to the Registrar's office.  A date of completion for the Makeup Final Evaluation must mutually agreed upon between the student and course instructor.  Students failing to contact the course instructor will receive a grade of zero for the Final Evaluation.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
