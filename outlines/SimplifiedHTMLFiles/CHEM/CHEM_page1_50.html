<p>Atomic and molecular clusters constitute intermediates between molecules, with clearly defined quantum states, and condensed matter where these states form bands or continua. As such, the study of clusters can be viewed as a means of unravelling the evolution of bulk properties from those of the constituent atoms/molecules. Interestingly, owing to the high ratio of surface atoms to bulk atoms, there are many analogies between the chemistry and physics of clusters and of solid surfaces. For this reason, clusters have traditionally been regarded as test cases for the study of surface reactivity and heterogeneous catalytic activity. More recently, however, attention has shifted towards cluster finite size effects, which leads to electronic, magnetic, optical, and chemical properties that are quite different from those of molecules or condensed matter. Now, the use of clusters as components in nanodevices is also attracting a great deal of attention. This course will describe the experimental generation, detection and interrogation of clusters, as well as the theoretical approaches that have been developed to aid in our understanding of their physical properties.</p><p>Chemistry 400 will be managed using the Desire2Learn (D2L) learning management system, which can be accessed via the LEARN facility at <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca">https://learn.uwaterloo.ca</a>. This site will provide course information, problem set postings and solutions, schedules, supplementary lecture material, practise quizzes, and other information that you might find useful. Please subscribe to notifications from the D2L CHEM 400 page.</p><p>The text for this course is a comprehensive set of notes that will be available on the course site. Students will also find the text “Atomic and Molecular Clusters” by Roy L. Johnston to be useful. This book can be found in the UW Davis library (QC173.4.M48 J64). A second text titled “Atomic and Molecular Clusters” by Elliot R. Bernstein (QD461.A857) is also available to students at UW for further reading. For an in depth study of cluster potential energy surfaces, the text “Energy Landscapes” by David J. Wales (QD462.6.P64 W35) is an excellent resource.</p><p>Absences from exams or missed problem sets may be accommodated <i><u>only if</u></i> a completed verification of illness or self-declaration of illness form (available from the “About Us” link at <a href="http://www.healthservices.uwaterloo.ca">http://www.healthservices.uwaterloo.ca</a>) is submitted. Absence for other reasons will result in a grade of <i><strong>zero</strong></i> for that component of the coursework.</p>

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
