Each of these quizzes is meant to assess your understanding of the background information and procedure and in some cases provide you with the quantities used for the experiment. Quizzes are answered <i><strong>individually</strong></i> and <i><strong>independently</strong></i>. You have a maximum of <strong>two attempts</strong> for the assignments that are automatically graded online. Möbius will keep the best of the two grades. <strong>Each pre-lab assignment must be completed before your experiment; late pre-lab assignments will not be accepted and you will not be allowed to complete the lab without completing your pre-lab.</strong></p><p><strong>Laboratory Performance</strong></p><p>Laboratory performance marks will be given by the Teaching Assistants and Lab Instructor and averaged for each in-person lab period. The performance grade includes: coming to the lab prepared and on time, observing all lab regulations and safety practices, being organized and neat while completing the experiment, using proper techniques and good time management allowing to complete the experiment in the allotted time, being able to independently perform the tasks in the laboratory, proper waste segregation as well as leaving your workstation in good standing.</p><p>In early experiments, there is often a perception that asking too many questions lead to performance penalties. This is not directly the case; we do expect students to need a lot of clarifications when working in the lab for the first time. It is less “costly” on the marks to ask these questions early on rather than making mistakes that lead to not successfully completing the experiment or that endanger you. It is normal to be less independent at the start of the term, but your confidence will improve, and your performance mark will increase faster if you learn from the many questions you ask your TA.</p><p>The grid used to evaluate your performance in each experiment will be available on LEARN. </p><p><strong>Experimental Outlines</strong></p><p>An experimental outline summarizes what you expect to do in the laboratory during an experiment. The document should be a brief, flow-chart or point-form, <strong>personally handwritten </strong>summary of what you will do during the experiment. The document should not contain excessive detail like the procedure does to be easy to follow while you perform the experiment. The purpose of the experimental outline is to help you organize your time efficiently by listing tasks in the approximate order in which you expect to accomplish them. For example, whenever a reflux (boiling) period is specified in a procedure, you will have some free time to set up the apparatus for the next step, reorganize your work area, clean glassware or take a melting point. <strong><u>Note</u></strong>: Your outline should include what glassware you need, the quantities of reagents/solvents required and what data you should record. A template is provided on yellow-coloured paper at the end of every experiment for you to complete. If you need more room, you can attach more pages but make sure to let your TA know as they will expect to only mark the yellow page!</p><p><strong>Laboratory Worksheets and Reports</strong></p><p>Each experiment has an associated worksheet (Experiments 1 and 2) or report (Experiments 3, 4 and 5). The worksheets are completed and submitted during your laboratory session (6.25% each) while reports are submitted online using the Crowdmark Grading System one week after your experiment (12.5% each). There are no formal reports, you only need to answer each of the questions in the report templates and submit to Crowdmark. </p><p>The worksheets are included in this manual, you will share only raw data with your partner and complete the rest of the worksheet individually. Report templates to complete are found on LEARN and Crowdmark, lab report submission can either be individual or with your partner. <strong>If submitting with your partner, add them on Crowdmark and submit a single report.</strong></p><p><strong>Crowdmark assignments must be submitted by the assigned due-date.</strong> Late assignments will not be accepted (grade of zero automatically applied). Any inquiries regarding the grading of post-lab assignments must be directed to your instructor within one week of receiving your graded feedback.</p><p><strong>Final Lab Exam</strong></p><p>The final exam is a 1.5-hour exam scheduled on Friday March 28 at 9:30 AM and will test your understanding of the CHEM 262L laboratory course content. Questions similar to the pre-laboratory quizzes and reports will be used, but may be modified to be multiple choice. More information regarding the final lab exam will be available towards the end of the semester. </p><p><strong>Obtaining a grade lower than 40% on the final lab exam will result in a reassessment of your grade and may result in a final course grade no higher than 50%.</strong></p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>General Policies</strong></p><ul><li>The LEARN platform is the main connection to the CHEM 262L communication. Please check the announcements regularly and your schedule to not miss any deadlines!</li><li>Aside from LEARN, we will use various software to facilitate the delivery of the laboratory. They will all be accessed via links on LEARN or emails. This software includes Möbius (auto-graded quizzes), Crowdmark (assignment submission software), and Piazza (discussion board). </li><li>The laboratory manual contains all introductory documents, experimental procedures and handouts for the CHEM 262L lab. You will find templates for the experimental outlines (yellow paper) and worksheets for the first two experiments you can tear away to submit. You will also have space to note information from pre-lab quizzes which are useful to help you complete the labs. The lab manual is available for purchase from the W Store.</li></ul><p><strong><u>Important note</u></strong>: Since the manual is printed months before delivery of the lab, we may need to make corrections during the term. These modifications will be communicated via LEARN announcements and included in the pre-lab talk before you begin your experiment.</p><ul><li>On LEARN, you will also find interactive versions of each experiment where videos and self-assessment questions are embedded in the same procedure printed in the lab manual. You are welcome to use either format for your preparation based on your preferences.</li><li>For Winter 2025, the WD deadline is March 21<sup>st</sup> and the WF deadline is April 8<sup>th</sup>, 2025. Note that students who wish to remain in CHEM 262L while dropping the lecture may do so if they are in good standing in the laboratory and have completed Experiment 4. Please contact the lab instructor if you need to explore this option.</li><li><strong><u>Important note</u></strong>: Using online social learning websites (Chegg, Course Hero, StuDocu and others) is considered cheating by the Faculty of Science’s academic integrity guidelines. Posting course material, report or quiz questions on these websites or using them to ‘check answers’ can lead to academic disciplinary probation as the websites collaborate in academic integrity investigations. For more information of the Faculty of Science’s expectations, please consult the How to Avoid Academic Misconduct webpage.</li></ul><p><strong>Laboratory Attendance</strong></p><ul><li>Laboratory work can be conducted in<i><strong> pairs</strong></i> or <i><strong>individually</strong></i>. All in-lab worksheets are completed individually but reports submitted on Crowdmark can be completed with your partner.</li><li><strong>Late arrival to the lab is not permitted.</strong> If you arrive before the pre-lab talk has finished, you will lose performance marks. No lab admission is permitted after the pre-lab talk has finished.</li><li>You should always attend the laboratory section that you are assigned to on your term schedule. If for any <strong>valid</strong> reason you cannot show up to your regularly scheduled session, you should contact the lab instructor and make alternative arrangements <strong>prior</strong> to the lab period.</li><li>If you are ill, contact the instructor <strong>before</strong> the lab period to have the experiment rescheduled or exempted. With an exemption, your lab mark will be the average of the other experiments/reports.</li><li>You cannot write a lab report for an experiment you have not completed yourself unless given explicit permission. This is generally reserved for incidents occurring while in lab and not for absences.</li><li>To obtain the lab credit you must complete at least four experiments and submit <u>four post-lab assignments</u> (missing one only for a valid reason). Valid reasons are supported by a verification of illness form.<strong> Submitting a VIF does not mean you are automatically rescheduled or exempted from the lab.</strong> If you must miss your lab, please email the instructor (Leanne Racicot) with the following information:</li><li>Your name and student ID</li><li><strong>Your lab section</strong></li></ul><p>There are only two sections of CHEM 262L this term, so rescheduling is a challenge. Please be mindful of this and avoid missing your lab for unapproved reasons.</p><ul><li>Students who miss laboratory sessions without a valid excuse will not be permitted to complete the experiment in another section and will be assigned a mark of <strong>zero</strong> for the worksheet/report, performance grade and experimental outline grade for that experiment.</li><li><strong>You must arrive prepared and ready for your experiment.</strong> This means you must have completed all pre-laboratory quizzes, you must bring a lab coat and safety glasses and your experimental outline must be prepared as stated in your experimental procedure. Coming to the lab unprepared will likely result in poor performance grade as your independence in the lab is evaluated. <strong>If your lack of preparation poses a danger to yourself and your peers, you will be asked to leave the lab and will receive a grade of zero for the experiment.</strong> Working in a group does not mean you are excused from your individual preparation!</li><li>For each laboratory session, you must bring:</li><li>Proper attire – you must wear long pants and closed-toe shoes to all labs.</li><li><strong>Lab coat and safety glasses</strong> – this is mandatory for all labs.</li><li><strong>Lab manual </strong>– strongly recommended to be able to refer to the full procedure as needed!</li><li><strong>Completed experimental outline</strong> – A brief summary of the steps of the experiment, written in your own words as either a flowchart or point form list. More details on the outline are included with each experiment and a template is provided in the lab manual (yellow pages).</li></ul><p><strong>Grades and Assignments</strong></p><ul><li>Insufficient preparation for your experiment will lead to performance marks deduction. While you will be working in pairs in the laboratory, performance marks are individual, and your TA will notice if you are relying on your partners to know what to do in the lab to complete your experiment. Completing the pre-lab quizzes and writing your <strong>own</strong> experimental outline will help you prepare, and don’t hesitate to reach out to the lab instructor if you have questions.</li><li><strong>All in-lab worksheets are individual</strong>. You can submit your reports on Crowdmark in pairs or individually. If you are collaborating with your partner, make sure you add them to assignment prior to submission.</li><li>Late assignments are not accepted, and a grade of zero is automatically applied to late assignments.</li><li>When you receive your marked lab report on Crowdmark, look it over. If you have any questions, please ask for clarifications via email to the instructor.</li><li>The lab instructor will ONLY re-grade the entire report, except in cases of obvious misgrade (ie. addition error or answer not seen). Sections of the lab report will not be re-graded without reviewing the rest of the report. If you choose to have your report re-graded by the instructor, the mark you receive from the instructor will be your final mark.</li><li>Discussions regarding grading issues must be done within one week (seven (7) days) of receiving the graded reports. </li></ul><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo and the CHEM 262L teaching team acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted in a legally binding treaty to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.</p><p>We also acknowledge the history of racism and colonial violence in which Canada was established as a country. Human rights must be centered in our pedagogical practice to ensure students feel safe and respected into our instructional spaces. We also acknowledge that speaking of underrepresented groups in Science is a misnomer and we should speak of historically excluded persons as Black, Indigenous, Queer and Persons of Colour have contributed to chemical research since the inception of the field. </p>

Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
