<p><strong>Text (not needed): </strong>Practical Process Research and Development – A guide for Organic Chemists Elsevier Science. 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition. by Neal G. Anderson. You can also buy this book online. <strong>I do not recommend that you buy the textbook. Only buy if you are truly interested because the book </strong>is written<strong> for an advanced audience. </strong>I have used the textbook as a guideline on what topics to teach and have used some of the examples given in the textbook. </p><p><strong>PowerPoint slides: </strong>I have put a lot of information on the course PowerPoint slides. I have done this so that they can be used as your course notes/textbook. The final exams will be based on the course notes and assignments.</p><p>Another great resource is the Journal of <strong>Organic Process Research and Development</strong> (OPR&amp;D). <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/journal/oprdfk">https://pubs.acs.org/journal/oprdfk</a> Take a look at this journal; it will give you a good idea of what this course is about.</p>

<p><strong>In Class Group assignments</strong></p><p>Assignments are scheduled to be completed and handed in on Fridays at the end of the class.<br/>There will be 10 group assignments based on the concepts learned throughout this course. </p><p>Students will be given the papers to read before class. However, students will not be given the questions until they get to class. Students will answer the questions as a group and submit them at the end of the class. Students can ask other groups or me for help during the class.</p><p><strong>Assigning groups:</strong></p><p>To foster diverse collaboration, you'll be working in groups of roughly 4 students with varied academic backgrounds (Chemistry, Medicinal Chemistry, Science, Biology, and Science and Business) and years of study (ranging from 3A to 4B). I'll form these groups and post them on LEARN after the first week of class.</p><p><strong>Group term paper</strong></p><p>This term paper requires collaborative effort in analyzing different synthesis methods for an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). You may choose to work with anyone in the class. Thus, you do not have to work with your assignment group members. Your group will select an API from a provided list or propose one of your own.  After researching multiple production processes, you'll write a paper that provides an overview of these methods and critically assesses their pros and cons based on the criteria and concepts covered in this course.</p><p>Individually, you'll delve deeper into one specific synthesis method, providing a detailed analysis. Then, as a group, you'll compare and contrast these methods, ultimately recommending the most suitable option for scaled-up production. This recommendation should be presented as if you're proposing it to your boss.</p><p>The final paper grade comprises two components: 60% for individual contributions and 40% for the collaborative group effort.  Furthermore, your paper will be assessed by both the professor (60%) and your peers (40%). More detailed information and resources will be available on LEARN.</p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Recommendations for how to cite GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
