  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>CHEM 254:</div>
<p>An introduction to the first, second, and third laws of thermodynamics and the application of these laws to ideal systems, mixtures, and chemical reactions. Thermodynamic principles are used to study changes in state, including phase changes, and to establish the link between the equilibrium constant and the properties of the substances involved in a chemical reaction.</p>

<p>This course is a basic introduction to thermodynamics with emphasis on applications in chemistry. The course is primarily concerned with the first, second, and third laws of thermodynamics and their application to pure substances, mixtures, and chemical reactions. The course provides the necessary background to study changes in state of many physical and chemical systems. Topics include entropy, Gibbs free energy and chemical potential, chemical equilibrium, real gases, phase equilibria of pure substances and mixed systems, and colligative properties.</p>

<h2>
  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>This is the approximate schedule for the course. There will be online and in-class assignments, on a rotating interval of about two weeks. The schedule is subject to change, depending on how much progress we make through the term - it is likely we will take a little longer than 6 weeks to cover the first three sections. The midterm will occur on a Wednesday, likely Feb 26 during class time. It will cover everything we have been able to complete before the February Break. The final exam will cover the entire course and will be scheduled and administered by the Registrar's office. It will occur in a 2.5 hour time slot sometime between April 9 and April 25 (I have no control over this scheduling).</p><p>Weeks 1 and 2:   The First Law, State Functions, and Thermochemistry</p><p>Weeks 3 and 4:   The Second and Third Laws, Entropy and Spontaneous Change</p><p>Weeks 5 and 6:   Gibbs Free Energy, Chemical Potential and Chemical Equilibrium</p><p>              ---   <i>February Break Week</i>  ---</p><p>Week 7:                Midterm (tentative); Properties of Real Gases                      </p><p>Week 8:                Phase Diagrams and the Relative Stability of Solids, Liquids and Gases                      </p><p>Weeks 9 and 10:  Ideal and Real Solutions</p><p>Weeks 11 and 12: Electrolyte Solutions               </p>

<p>Thermodynamics requires a lot of background work and review to ensure that the principles and applications become very familiar to you during the term. To help make this effort worthwhile, I have set aside 10% of the final grade for the course to be gained by simply completing some pre-chapter questions online. These will not be marked for correctness, but you will gain credit for each quiz completed. The quizzes will cover the main points of the textbook sections that we’re about to begin, and will be due before the first lecture on that topic, so I’m hoping this will encourage you to read ahead in the textbook. It will be a lot easier for you to follow what I am covering in lectures if you are already somewhat familiar with the terminology and concepts by reading ahead.</p><p>In addition, I have prepared a number of narrated powerpoint lectures, which I hope you will find useful in learning the material. Each lecture also has notes that provide written transcripts of what I am speaking, in case that helps you to learn some of the terms. I will also provide some worked examples, and provide some homework questions and solutions, not for marks, that you can use for practice to assess your own learning. There are also course notes available on LEARN that may help with your learning - these are a work in progress and may be updated at times throughout the term, and I will alert you to any revisions (and also invite your comments and suggestions on them).</p><p>There will be two types of assignments. One will be tutorial assignments which you will complete the first half of the problem individually, then work on an extension of the problem in groups of 4. These will occur on set days, typically Wednesdays, during the term.</p><p>I have also set up a group for us to communicate on Microsoft Teams, available at:</p><p><a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3AV1Yv6mkTmqBSiBEHPexygfeLbjDU2Bj25nsxaSWzPjo1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=b191c04d-6e2f-4e82-9db7-ebaf268ea27b&amp;tenantId=723a5a87-f39a-4a22-9247-3fc240c01396">CHEM 254 - Winter 2025 | General | Microsoft Teams</a></p><p>I will provide any materials there as well as on LEARN, just in case one or the other has access issues. It will also be the best way for you to contact me with questions. I would encourage any questions on content of the course to be an open discussion within that group on Teams. Any questions regarding your own personal situation or needs can be communicated directly and only to me via Teams.</p><p>There will also be online assignments completed through our course tool Mobius. I will provide links on LEARN to each assignment when they are ready, and you will have at least two weeks to complete them. </p><p>Finally, there will be a midterm and a final exam, with format to be communicated later closer to their dates.</p><p> </p>

<p role="note">* - If your mark on the final exam is greater than your mark on the midterm, I will change the weighting of these elements to 40% Final Exam, 10% Midterm. No other changes will be allowed.</p>

<p>The number of assignments will be 8, but they will be split into two different types to help you scaffold or layer your learning. Four of the assignments, involving both individual and group work in a team-based learning (TBL) format, should help you to be able to assess different thermodynamic systems and learn to use the appropriate thermodynamic tools. The other four assignments, to be completed individually and much broader in scope and effort required, will help you to apply those skills to more complex and realistic physical and chemical systems. These may cover several chapters at a time. As a consequence, they will be more than “one-night” assignments, and you should work on them as we cover the material they are drawn from. The assignments will be available and completed online through the LEARN site, and will be <strong>due at the beginning the lecture period</strong> on the due date I indicate. Late assignments will not be accepted.</p><p>As there are several assignments and quizzes within these categories, an absence due to illness will be accommodated by scaling the remaining elements of that category of assessment. If you miss the midterm, the final exam will be worth 50% of your mark. If you miss the final exam, a makeup exam will need to be taken at the next offering of the course, in Spring 2025.</p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as problem solving in a chemical and scientific context. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.
