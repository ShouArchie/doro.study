<p>A review of water and aqueous solutions with an emphasis on properties that have the most impact on biological processes will begin the course. The fundamental chemical and physical properties of amino acids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids are then discussed in detail. The organization of these building blocks into more complex structures such as proteins, enzymes, polynucleotides, polysaccharides, and biological membranes will be described. Various methods for the purification and characterization of proteins, enzymes and nucleic acids will also be studied. The structure and function of representative proteins such as myoglobin and hemoglobin and enzymes such as chymotrypsin will also be discussed. Applications and importance of the above to real world situations will be provided.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Calculators: You can use any scientific calculator for the term tests and final exam in CHEM233</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Requests for Extra Credit or Grade Increases:</strong>  Please do not request extra marks from the course instructor. Arbitrarily increasing a final course grade is unethical and unfair to the rest of the class.  The course instructor will not respond to such requests.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Missing an online assignment:  </strong>Accommodations are not normally provided for missed assignments.  Assignments are available for an extended period, and you should be working on each assignment over an extended period. Typically, a short illness (or other obligation) will not seriously impact students' ability to complete their assignments on time.  However, you should notify your instructor if you are ill for over a week. Your instructor will consider your circumstances and inform you if any accommodations for missed assignments will be provided.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Absence on the day of a term test or final exam:  </strong>If you do not write a term test, and have not planned with your instructor, you will receive a grade of zero on the test.  If you do not write the final exam, and have not made planned with your instructor, you will receive a final course grade of DNW (did not write), which is equivalent to a final course grade of 32%.</p><p>If you miss a term test or final exam because of illness or another valid, documentable reason, you can avoid a zero grade or DNW by completing the five-part process described below.</p><ol><li><strong>Contact your instructor within 24 hours of a missed term test or exam.</strong> Emails can be received 24 hours per day. </li><li><strong>Get documentation to explain your absence.</strong><ol><li>If you are ill, have yourself examined at the University of Waterloo campus Health Services <i><strong>before or within 48 hours</strong> </i>of the missed term test or exam.  They will complete a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness Form (VIF)</a> for you.  Assessment of illness must be based on an actual examination <i><strong>before or within 48 hours</strong> </i>of the term test or exam rather than an account of how you felt several days ago. <strong>VIFs issued by walk-in clinics will not be accepted</strong>, except when obtaining a VIF from Health Services is not possible. If you are ill on a weekend, during off-hours, while out-of-town or receiving ongoing care from a family physician or specialist, it is acceptable to provide documentation from other health service providers. Information should include date of physician assessment, dates of illness, level of incapacitation and whether the diagnosis was made by the physician or based on a description by the student.  If you do not have University of Waterloo's VIF with you at the time you are seen by the external health service provider, or the documentation provided does not include the required information, you will need to go back and have them complete and sign the VIF. This official verification is necessary before any action can be taken.</li><li>For other extenuating circumstances that are not illness related, for which the VIF is not appropriate, official documented proof that something has occurred will be required (consult with your instructor).  It is understood that sometimes events occur beyond your control so if in doubt, contact your instructor if you have a compelling reason.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Bring your documentation to the Science Undergraduate Office (STC 2031)</strong> <strong>once you feel better.</strong>  Your instructor will receive notification automatically by e-mail once you have done so.  Contact your instructor if you cannot take your documentation to the Science Undergraduate Office within a week. </li><li><strong>Bring a copy of your documentation to your instructor.</strong>  The Science Undergraduate Office does not do this. You have two weeks from the missed term test or exam date to clear your zero/DNW grade. </li><li><strong>Wait for notification from your instructor.</strong> Your instructor will review the documentation, decide, and then notify you whether it will be accepted or if you will be assigned a grade of zero/DNW.  <i><strong>Note that filing documentation with the Science Office does NOT automatically excuse the missing of a term test or exam.</strong></i>  The information provided on the documentation will be evaluated when deciding whether a student should be excused.  Students should carefully consider the wisdom of missing a test or an exam. </li></ol><p><strong>Failure to carry out steps 1-5 above will result in a grade of zero on the term test or a DNW on the final exam. </strong>The following rules apply when the student’s documentation has been found acceptable.</p><ul><li><strong>Missing a term test:</strong> The weight of the term test will be transferred to the final exam. (<strong>There are no make-up term tests)</strong> </li><li><strong>Missing the final exam:</strong>  A makeup exam will be arranged.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor to discuss the arrangements for writing a makeup exam.  The arrangements will be recorded on a form and sent to the Registrar’s office.  The student and instructor will receive a copy of the form by e-mail.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>(See Faculty of Science Webpage for Up-to-Date Guidelines for </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Accommodations for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances</a><strong>.)</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Expectation of Academic Integrity</strong></p><p>The University of Waterloo subscribes to the strictest interpretation of academic integrity.  Faculty members and students bear joint responsibility, ensuring that we maintain high standards of academic integrity. </p><p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: To maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility.
