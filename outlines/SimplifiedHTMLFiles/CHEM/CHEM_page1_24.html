<p>Chemistry 265: Organic Chemistry II is a continuation of Chem264. The emphasis of this course is on the development of problem-solving skills in the context of structure elucidation, synthesis and mechanism of reaction of organic compounds. This course aims to reinforce the fundamental aspects of organic chemistry and show how these can be used to explain physical properties and reactivity patterns of organic molecules.</p>

<p><strong>Problem Set Policies:</strong></p><p>Problem sets are submitted every other week according to the course schedule using Crowdmark. They are to be completed <i>individually</i> and are an important learning tool in this course. Students who put time and effort into the problem sets will see that effort pay off on the term tests and the final exam. Students are encouraged to seek out help from the instructor and TAs to maximize their understanding of the concepts covered on the problem sets. The problem sets are a good representation of the types of questions on the term tests and the final exam.</p><p>Students will be assessed on their top 5 problem sets, dropping the lowest problem set. If a student’s final exam grade is higher than their top 5 problem set grade, then the weight of the problem sets will be shifted to the final exam, increasing the students overall grade. This is done so that students have nothing to lose by making valid attempts at the problem sets. </p><p>Students cannot use their problem set grade to pass this course. Students must pass at least one term test or the final exam to pass this course. Students that fail both term tests and the final exam will not pass this course.</p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> is in affect for all graded components in this course, including problem sets. This does not mean students cannot discuss problem set questions with their peers, but it does mean students must write out their answers using their own words and own structures, drawn themselves. Here are some tips to ensuring you do not violate this policy:</p><ul><li>Avoid writing out your answers, including drawing diagrams, during discussions with your peers; make it a habit of going to your own space to write/draw things out. This will help keep your language and drawings original, so they are flagged as a potential violation.</li><li>Never give your answers to another student “to look at”; giving your answers to someone violates Policy 71 as much as the person who copies your answers.</li><li>Do not “snip” drawings from online sources, either draw them yourself using a chemical drawing program or by hand.</li><li>Keep in mind that posting solutions online. </li></ul><p><strong>Term Test Policies:</strong></p><p>Students missing a term test must provide accepted documentation (i.e., VIF, self-declaration, etc.). Students who miss a term test and do <u>not</u> provide documentation will receive a zero on that term test and the weight will <u>not</u> be shifted to the final exam. Students who miss a term test with documentation will automatically be assessed using grading scheme 2. Students missing more than one term test for a <u>valid reason</u> will have the weight of the missed term tests automatically shifted to the final exam – increasing the weight of the final exam accordingly. </p><p>There will be <u>no</u> make-up term tests or term tests offered outside of the scheduled date/time for <u>any</u> reason.</p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
