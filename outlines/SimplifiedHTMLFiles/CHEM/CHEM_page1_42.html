  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>CHEM 360:</div>
<p>Enolate alkylation, condensation, conjugate addition, and pericyclic reactions. FMO theory, organometallics, and transition metal-catalyzed C-C bond formation.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Chemistry 360 </strong>builds on the concepts and chemistry taught in CHEM 264 and CHEM 265. It is expected that CHEM 360 will help tie together and bring relevance to previous course material. By the end of this course, you should be familiar with basic aspects of organic reactivity, understand the mechanistic basis for synthetically important reactions, and be able to predict the outcome of many organic reactions. If you want to do well in CHEM 360, you should re-familiarize yourself with some of the material in your introductory organic chemistry courses.</p><p>More specifically, CHEM 360 will familiarize students with some of the modern synthetic methods for the formation of carbon-carbon sigma bonds in organic compounds. An array of anionic, cationic, pericyclic, and organometallic methods will be introduced as part of three general sections, and the factors governing the mechanistic, stereochemical and regiochemical course of these processes will be presented and discussed as appropriate. </p><p><strong>Section 1</strong> will cover enols and enolates, condensations and a-substitutions of carbonyl compounds (acid- and base-catalyzed), and conjugate addition to a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds (acid- and base-catalyzed). </p><p><strong>Section 2 </strong> will cover pericyclic reactions (cycloadditions under thermal and photochemical conditions), with an emphasis on how an appreciation of frontier molecular orbitals allows for prediction of the reactivity of the systems (thermal and photochemical conditions), as well as relative reaction rates, regiochemistry and stereochemistry.  </p><p><strong>Section 3 </strong> will present transition-metal catalysis and organometallic reactions, with a particular emphasis on Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.</p>

<p>The term tests are intended to assess your comprehension of the course materials covered in <u>Sections 1 and 2</u> of the course material, respectively. Term tests are 75-minutes and are scheduled for Friday, February 7<sup>th</sup> and Friday, March 14<sup>th</sup>, from 6:30 pm to 8:00 pm in DC 1351. <i>The exams are in-person, and any conflicts with the timing of these exams should be brought to my attention ASAP for possible alternate exam scheduling. </i></p><p>The Final Exam is 150 minutes long (2.5 hours), is in-person, and is to be scheduled by the Registrar’s office. This assessment will be broken into two parts:</p><p>Part 1: An assessment of your comprehension of the course materials covered in <u>Section 3</u> of the course . This will be 75 minutes in length and will be worth 25% of your course grade.</p><p>Part 2: A comprehensive assessment that will cover the materials from <u>Sections 1-3</u> of the course. This will be 75 minutes in length and will be worth 25% of your course grade.</p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
