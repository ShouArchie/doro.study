<p>"Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry" is the title for this section of Chem400</p><p>In the Winter 2025 term the focus of the course will be electronic structure theory and a smaller segment on coupled electron-nuclear motion, developing theory beyond the Born Oppenheimer approximation. The course will cover a description of the basic electronic structure problem introducing an atomic orbital basis set, Slater determinants and the Slater-Condon rules. Then we will cover Hartree-Fock theory in fair detail and discuss density functional theory. We will move on to the technique of second quantization and discuss techniques to include electron correlation: Configuration Interaction, Coupled Cluster, methods for excited states. Second quantized methods and Wick’s theorem will be discussed. In another segment we will discuss vibronic coupling, introducing diabatic electronic states and simple model problems and introduce techniques to solve them using simple Python programs. It is my intention that students will write their own (simple) programs to do actual calculations. One assignment will be to write your own Hartree-Fock program. For students who have very little programming experience they can alternatively do a computational project using Gaussian or ORCA, or a literature review project.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>We will just use hand written assignments in this course, to be handed in, in class.</p><p>There will not be a midterm or final exams. The grading is bases on extensive assignments and a project. You are allowed to collaborate on assignments. Just make sure to write the final solutions out by yourself.</p><p>The project can vary for different students.</p><p>A. For graduate students it involves a programming assignment of a Hartree-Fock program in Python.</p><p>B. For students unfamiliar with the Gaussian program it will require the study of the thermochemistry of a simple reaction and a small research report, similar to a lab report. It is also possible to do a computational project using ORCA. Explore something new.</p><p>C. For others it can be a literature study of a computational or theoretical paper, with a written report (summary).</p>

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><p> </p><p>Since assignments are at the core of the assessment for the class, I want everybody to do all of these assignments. We will have deadlines for the assignments but there can be flexibility for extensions. Students can contact the instructor. The project component is flexible, and everybody will have to complete their project with a written submission. The people that write the Hartree-Fock program can simply submit their python file.</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
