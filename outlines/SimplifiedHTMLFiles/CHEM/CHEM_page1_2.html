<h2><strong>Course Structure and Continuity Plans</strong></h2><p><strong>Classes:</strong>  Classes are scheduled each Tuesday and Thursday in RCH 101  at 1:00PM - 2:20PM.  CHEM 120 is designed as a <strong>blended course</strong>.  Before each class, all students are expected to prepare by watching assigned video content and reviewing the course notes.  During each class, we will focus on content review and the application of knowledge through problem-solving activities.  It is imperative that you do the pre-class work to ensure effective use of our synchronous in-person classes.</p><p><strong>Course Continuity Plans:  </strong>CHEM 120 is a synchronous, in-person course. </p><p><i>If you cannot come to class:</i> We understand that at any point during the term, you may become symptomatic and may not be able to join the in-person class. If you are unable to attend the in-person class one section of CHEM 120 will be recorded and posted for asynchronous viewing. </p><p><i>In the event of campus closure:</i> If in-person activities are suspended, or in the event of a campus closure, all in-person classes and tutorials will occur as online synchronous meetings using the appropriate platform.  Assessments will run online in this situation.</p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The due dates for Online Assignments are due at 9:00 pm on the due date.   You have a 3-day grace period to finish the assignment, after which no further submissions will be accepted for grades (no exceptions!). You do not need to contact your instructor if you are using a grace day.</li><li>For assignments, we strongly recommend you submit your first attempt 5-7 days prior to the recommended due date so you have time to assess your feedback and fix your mistakes for your subsequent attempts.</li><li>Weekly participation challenges typically open on Thursday mornings, and close at 9:00 pm on the following Wednesday evening.  No extensions will be granted for Participation Challenges, but each student can drop one participation challenge from their overall grade.</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p>

<p><strong>Course Notes: </strong>Course notes are posted on LEARN (as a PDF).  Printed spiral bound copies of the course notes can be purchased online from the UW bookstore <a href="https://wstore.uwaterloo.ca/">https://wstore.uwaterloo.ca/</a>  </p><p> </p><h2>Learning Methods</h2><p><strong>Content Videos:  </strong>Throughout the content videos, the instructors will focus on selected topics from the course notes. Prepare for each video by reading the relevant sections of the course notes or text in advance.  You are expected to learn some of the course material on your own. </p><p><strong>Synchronous classes and tutorials:  </strong>In your synchronous classes and tutorials your instructors and teaching assistants will review content and guide you through various problem-solving activities to help you apply your knowledge and skills to new problem-solving situations.</p><p><strong>Online Assignments:  </strong>The assignments are provided online so that you can obtain frequent and immediate feedback on your understanding of the concepts.  Each online assignment can be repeated up to three times, so you can correct your mistakes or get help.  If you earn a grade of 80.0% or higher on an online assignment it will be treated as 100% in the calculation of the assignment grades at the end of the term.  Historically, students who do the online assignments as scheduled earn higher grades than students who do not do the assignments.</p><p><strong>Q&amp;A sessions:  </strong>During virtual or in-person drop-in Q&amp;A sessions, the instructors or teaching assistants will be available for “drop-in” question-and-answer style interaction.  These Q&amp;A sessions may be held in person or online.  Further instructions will be given on LEARN.  </p><p><strong>Piazza Q&amp;A:  </strong>We use Piazza for questions for help from instructors, teaching assistants and classmates.  Using Piazza, you can post anonymously, post publicly to the class, or privately to the instructors.  All course content questions are to be posted on the course Piazza boards to ensure we can help you in quickly and efficiently.  Instructors will recommend that all students post questions on the Piazza discussion boards instead of emailing instructors directly.</p><p><strong>Extra Practice Problems:</strong>  For each module, we have assigned problems for you to try (posted on LEARN).  You are not required to hand in solutions to these problems; the responsibility to do them is yours.</p>

<p><strong>Participation (10%):</strong> We will count 7 of the 8 participation challenges (online quizzes, graded 50% for completion, 50% for your earned grade).  If you do not do the participation components, or if your participation grades do not help your overall grade, the 10% weight for participation is transferred 5% to your term test grades and 5% to your final exam grade. We calculate all grades with and without the participation component, and only include the grade if it helps your overall grade.  Please note: Missing a participation challenge with a VIF or other valid reason does not mean you can drop a second challenge. We will drop one challenge for all students. Submission policy:  Participation challenges must be completed by the due date indicated in the schedule. There are no extensions permitted. </p><p><strong>Online Assignments (10%):</strong> Online assignments are posted on LEARN. We will count 9 of the 10 online assignments. You get three attempts for each assignment and the highest earned grade is recorded.  If you earn a grade of 80% or higher on an assignment, the mark will be treated as 100% when calculating your assignment average. This adjustment is done at the end of the term.  If you choose not to do the assignments, the 10% weight for the assignments is transferred 5% to your term test grades and 5% to your final exam grade. We calculate all grades with and without the assignment component and only include the grade if it helps your overall grade.  Submission policy:  Assignments must be completed by the due date.  Each student may use up to 3 “grace days” for each assignment, after which no further submissions will be permitted. </p><p><strong>Term Tests (40%):  </strong>There will be two tests in CHEM 120. Test 1 is on <strong>Thursday, February 6th </strong>and counts for 20% of the course grade.  Test 2 is on <strong>Thursday, March 13th </strong>and counts for 20% of the course grade.  Details for each test will be posted on LEARN approximately one week in advance. <strong>Note: </strong>If you write both term tests, the weight of your lowest written test can be transferred to your final exam if it increases your overall grade.  This will be calculated automatically for you at the end of the term.  If you miss a test for a valid reason, the weight of the missed test will be transferred to the final exam.</p><p><strong>Final Exam (40%):</strong> There will be a cumulative final exam held during the exam period (April). Check the schedule <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/exam-schedule">https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/exam-schedule</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>The grade calculation described above applies only if the weighted average of your tests and exam is at least 50%.  If the weighted average of your tests and exam is less than 50%, then that weighted average is also your course grade.</strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Why do we place extra emphasis on the weighted average of your tests and exam?</strong> Our experience, compiled over many years, indicates that low marks on the tests and exam are a very strong indicator that a student has not mastered the material.  The assignments are important because they will help you prepare for the tests and exam, so it is in your best interests to do them. Learn from your mistakes on the assignments before writing the tests or exam.</p>
