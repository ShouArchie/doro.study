<p>CHEM 267 is a continuation of the study of fundamental aspects of organic chemistry begun in CHEM 266. The emphasis of the course is on the development of problem solving skills in the context of reaction mechanisms, structure-reactivity relationships and structure elucidation. The course will require you to understand why some molecular features lead to certain reactivity patterns and use that knowledge to make sound predictions in different but related systems. Topics include a description of chemical and physical properties of carbonyl, aromatic, and nitrogen compounds and an introduction to spectroscopic methods for the identification of organic molecules.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p><strong>Learning Methods</strong></p><p><strong>Active participation in the classroom. </strong>Approximately 60% of the class time is spent completing questions in groups. To prepare for the lecture, you must read sections of your course notes, watch the pre-lecture videos on Learn and make notes in your course notes. Actively engage in the videos. The lectures are taught in an "active-learning" way, emphasizing problem-solving and not the regurgitation of information. There is memorization, but you must memorize with understanding to do well in the Course. You must be able to see the differences and similarities between reactions.</p><p><strong>Online Textbook reading participation questions (10%, optional): Top Hat Organic I &amp; II </strong></p><p><strong><u>There is no cost if you already have the Textbook.</u> Add this Course by clicking on: <u>Join Course </u>and enroll in the course textbook 482263 </strong>directly without paying. The name of the Course is: CHEM 267 Winter 25. The course textbook has been modified specifically for the Winter 2025 course. If you experience any issues, contact Top Hat support <a href="https://success.tophat.com/s/contact-main">https://success.tophat.com/s/contact-main</a> , and they will help you. </p><p>If you ave not bought the Textbook, the cost of the Textbook is $99. You have unlimited access to the textbook content for life. The Textbook can be obtained by going to the Top Hat website (https://tophat.com/) and clicking Sign-up. The Join code for this Course is <strong>482263</strong> and the name of the Course is: CHEM 267 Winter 25.</p><p>When you sign into the Textbook, you will see the chapter models in the left window. The chapter modules are in the order we will cover on LEARN. The Interactive Textbook contains text, videos, and questions. The Interactive Textbook is a multimedia learning tool to help you visualize and understand organic chemistry. Thus, the grades associated with the questions in the Textbook are for participation, which means you are graded on attempting the questions, not on whether you get the question correct. </p><p><strong>Participation grades:</strong> <strong>(10% optional)</strong></p><p>Answer at least 5 to 10 in-chapter questions in the Textbook. Ask and answer two questions using the chat feature called threads in the Textbook. To get immediate feedback on your questions, use the artificial intelligence ACE. You may count comment on how well ACE answered another student's question as an answer to a student's question. The questions on the pages must be completed by the due dates as specified in the course schedule. All grades will be uploaded into LEARN after the due dates. Your official participation grades are on LEARN (ignore the Top Hat Gradebook).</p><p>Make sure you put your ID number into your Top Hat account. This is how the instructors consolidate your reading assignment grades in Top Hat to LEARN: You will see a gear at the top right of the website. Click on the gear/My Account/Student Number (ID)-Grading setup.</p><p><strong>Aktiv Online assignments (10% optional)</strong></p><p>To help students understand mechanisms and why reactions occur to produce specific compounds, students will be asked to do questions in Aktiv. The Aktiv assignments will ask you to draw molecules and use arrows for mechanisms. <strong>Cost $35.</strong> </p><p>A PDF is also given on LEARN</p><ol><li>Visit aktiv.com/login</li><li>If you are new user, Click "Create New Account"</li><li>Create a Student Account by filling out the Sign Up form</li><li>Verify your account e-mail by clicking on the link request</li><li>In your Account page, click "Join Course" Enter 83QVYE as your course code</li><li>Each Aktiv Chemistry course has a payment grace period.</li><li>When you are ready to activate your Course, select "Activate Now".</li><li>Select "Activate Course" in the account screen.</li><li>Purchase online or entering an access code purchased at your campus bookstore**</li><li>Download Aktiv Learning from the App Store or Play Store on your iPhone, iPad, or Android device</li><li>Login using your Student Account credentials</li></ol><p><strong>Discussion board.</strong></p><p>We will use the Piazza discussion board to discuss all course content, including questions about assignments and tests. This platform is free to UW students. To access it, click on the link in LEARN or copy and paste the following link into your browser. </p><p>When asking a question, please include a picture or screenshot of your questions. This makes it much easier for other students and me to help you.</p><p>If you do not feel a question is suitable for the board, you may direct message me in Piazza or email me spforsey@uwaterloo.ca.</p><p><strong>Practice–practice–practice.</strong></p><p>Solving problems–making connections–and recognizing patterns are key steps to succeeding in this Course. This Course requires constant effort; you cannot learn a course of this nature right before an exam. While the initial effort may seem overwhelming, you will better understand the course material in the long run and not have to "cram" before a term test or exam (and do much better in the Course!!)</p><p>Listen to the podcast: How to be great at just about anything: <a href="http://freakonomics.com/podcast/peak/">http://freakonomics.com/podcast/peak/</a></p><p>And the other podcasts on LEARN. They talk about how deliberate practice is used to improve performance. Just putting in the hours does not make you an expert. Also, people need to be guided through the hours of study. To bring talent to fruition, you need to absorb what has been done before to make the next step possible. Not all ideas and comments in the podcast can be used to learn organic chemistry, but I truly believe in deliberate practice or, in the case of learning a university course, active studying. <strong>Instead of just passively reading, you must actively participate in learning to teach yourself a subject with the guidance of an Instructor.</strong></p><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Absence on the day of a test or exam: </strong>If you miss any examination, either a term test or final, then you shall be given a grade of zero on that examination unless you missed the examination for valid reasons (e.g. illness). If you miss an examination because of illness, you must provide a completed Verification of Illness Form, which can be obtained from the Health Services web-site (<a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/health-services/student-medical-clinic/services"><i><strong>http://uwaterloo.ca/health-services/student-medical-clinic/services</strong></i></a>). The completed form must be registered with the Science Undergraduate Office. The Undergraduate Office will keep the original form for their records and contact the course instructor. The completed form must specify the precise period of absence and include the date of the test/exam. If you become ill while away from the University and miss a test or an exam as a result of that illness, then you may supply a Doctor’s certificate covering the precise period of absence, provided the certificate includes a classification of the illness as slight, moderate, or severe. In all cases, the letter or form must include contact information of the person who signed the letter or form, and it must be registered with the Science Undergraduate Office.</p><p><strong> A Verification of Illness Form (VIF) or a doctor’s note does not necessarily excuse a student from missing a test or exam!</strong> The instructors and course coordinator will consider the information provided on the VIF or doctor’s note when deciding whether a student should be excused.Being excused from a test or exam is NOT automatic upon the presentation of suitable medical verification. Students should carefully consider the wisdom of missing a test or exam. <strong>If it is decided that a student has a legitimate excuse for missing a term test or an exam, the following rules apply</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Missing a test:</strong> The weight of the test will be transferred to the final exam. (<strong>There are no make-up term tests!</strong>) </li><li><strong>Missing the final exam:</strong> A makeup exam will be written in April, scheduled by the Science Undergraduate office. Missing the make-up exam will result in an INC which eventually converts to an FTC for CHEM 266 which is equivalent to 32% in the course.</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
