<p>This laboratory course is designed to complement the content of lecture course CHEM 237 through a series of selected experiments. The goal of this laboratory course is to have students gain exposure to and experience with basic biochemistry lab techniques including (but not restricted to) methods for accurate volume transfer, chemical titration, the operation of a basic spectrophotometer, column chromatography, and electrophoresis. Students will be guided through the process of collecting data and further proper analysis of it.</p><p><strong>Attendance: </strong>CHEM 237L requires your attendance every other week on your scheduled lab day as per quest.</p><p>This course is divided into six experiments. Each experiment is represented in the required lab manual (to be purchased at the W Store) as well as on LEARN. The lab manual includes the experimental procedures, pre-lab exercises and reporting information, whereas the content on LEARN includes information related to the relative concepts being used, procedural videos and videos informing how to use the instruments in the lab. We will also be using LEARN for report submissions/grading (Turnitin dropbox) and for keeping track of grades.</p><p>Your grade will encompass your readiness and performance in the lab, your average grade on the pre-lab quizzes and your average grade on your lab report submissions.</p>

<p role="note">**Student travel plans are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time. (see http://www.registrar.uwaterloo.ca/exams/finalexams.html ).

<h4>Course Requirements</h4><p><strong>Attendance: </strong>Lab attendance is mandatory. If you miss the first lab session, you won't have the necessary safety knowledge for the lab environment, which is essential for participation in future labs. In the event of illness, or for other legitimate reasons, contact the Laboratory Instructor as soon as possible to discuss the possibility of alternate arrangements. The arrangement may include making up the experiment in a different section running the same experiment. Accommodations will only be considered with verified Verification of Illness Forms (VIF), counselling letters, etc. Students should bring their VIFs to the Science Undergraduate Office for verification and filing. In the case of a legitimate single missed laboratory period (confirmed by a VIF and approved by the instructor), the course weighting of the missed grade elements will be added to the final lab test. In the case of a legitimately missed lab that has been acknowledged by the instructor, it is the responsibility of the student to obtain data from their lab partner (if partnered) and have a completed lab report ready for submission on the due date. In the case of two or more missed laboratory periods (regardless of reason), the student will be assigned an incomplete (INC) for that term and will have to return in the subsequent offered term to complete the missing course components. <br/>Missing a lab session without making prior arrangements with the instructor will result in a 15% deduction in the final grade. Missing a lab for travel reasons will not be considered acceptable.<br/>Missed laboratory exams (with a valid, verified reason) will result in an INC grade. A makeup exam will be written with the next course offering. CHEM 237L is offered during Winter and Spring terms. Travel is not a valid reason for missing an exam or any other assessment for the course.</p><p><strong>Pre-Lab Quizzes:</strong> The quizzes will be open book and online. They will be due before the start of your in-person lab session. If you do not complete the quiz by your scheduled lab time, you will receive a zero for that quiz.  </p><p><strong>Reports: </strong>Lab reports are informal. A guide/instructions for your reports is provided in your lab manual as well as on LEARN (Performance Aids). Each experiment in the lab manual will include a list of the material to be submitted in the report and their respective order. A report normally consists of (i) a presentation of your experimental data; (ii) a data analysis section, i.e. treatment of data (calculations) and plots; (iii) a series of questions that require you to apply your understanding of the respective module; and (iv) a brief summary (one-two sentences). All reports must be typed and organized in the order as instructed and must have an accompanying data form signed by a TA. Once you complete your report, you will need to save it as <strong><u>one PDF file</u></strong> and submit it to the Dropbox (on LEARN) in the specific Dropbox folder for its respective experiment. Reports submitted in a form other than PDF or in more than one file will not be graded and receive a zero.  </p><p>All lab reports are informal and are<strong> due online before the beginning of the next scheduled laboratory period</strong> – except for the last two reports. Students should consult the Laboratory Schedule provided on LEARN for specific dates.  Lab reports submitted one day late shall receive a deduction of 20% from the final grade of that report. <strong>Reports submitted more than 24 hours after the due date will NOT be graded and receive a grade of zero.</strong></p><p><strong>Exam:</strong> The final lab exam for this course will be scheduled by the registrar during the exam week. Questions will be based on all of the work conducted in the lab and the information introduced throughout the term (both on LEARN and in the Lab Manual). The grade obtained on the final lab exam will make up 35% of your final grade. You must attend the lab exam or else receive a zero for that grade. Elective arrangements (conflicts such as travel) are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative exam time. <strong>** Obtaining a grade lower than 40% on the final lab exam will result in a reassessment of your grade and may result in a final course grade <u>no higher</u> than 50%**  </strong></p><p> </p><h4>Submission Times and Late Policy</h4><p>Quizzes that are not submitted will not be graded and be counted as a zero. </p><p>Lab reports will be due online before the beginning of the next scheduled laboratory period – except for the last two reports (TBA once the exam schedule is out). Students should consult the Laboratory Schedule provided on LEARN for specific dates. Reports will be penalized a deduction of 20% for being one day late unless there is a valid reason; e.g., instructor-accepted valid VIF. <strong>The report dropboxes will close 24 hours after the due date and any reports not submitted by then will not be graded and result in a zero for that respective assessment. </strong>  </p><p>Contact the instructor as soon as you realize that there is a problem. If you are experiencing technical connection difficulties while submitting your report, you must email the instructor immediately with a copy of your report attached to the email before the due date/time (if you don't want the late penalty to be applied) or before the dropbox closes (if you want your report to be graded). </p><p>If you are too sick to function on your experimental day, please contact the instructor. Visit a health professional and then email a scanned copy of the Verification of Illness Form to the SUO. In your email to the instructor, provide your name, student ID number, section number, and exactly which experiment you missed. Further information regarding Management of Requests for Accommodation due to Illness can be found on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/academics/academics-undergraduate-students/accommodation-due-illness">Accommodation due to illness</a> page. </p><p> </p><h4>COVID-19 and Illness Policies</h4><p>It is possible that a COVID-19 outbreak can cause a student to become ill and unable to complete a course assessments/requirements. The following policy addresses this situation. If by chance, a circumstance occurs that is not mentioned in the policy below, an alternative sensible arrangement will be made between the instructor and student/s. Any concerns you have with the policy below should be addressed to the instructor, Harmeen Deol.</p><p><strong>In the event that a student becomes ill: </strong></p><ul><li>Please follow the instructions found on the Science Undergraduate Office page for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">SUO illness accommodations</a>.</li><li>If you are missing a component of the course, you should always inform the instructor at the earliest time possible. An alternate arrangement or schedule will be discussed between you and the instructor.</li><li>If your validated illness causes the inability to complete attend your scheduled lab section (and quiz), you may be instructed to attend another lab section if agreed to by both student and instructor, or the grade may be redistributed to another course component. <i>Note: this only applies of you are ill and agreed upon by you and the instructor.</i> An INC or IP grade may be assigned if more than one lab is missed.</li><li>If your validated illness causes your inability to attend or complete <strong>the lab exam</strong> an INC or IP grade may be assigned or you may be asked to write it during a makeup exam session or with the next term offering. CHEM 237L is offered only in the - Winter and Spring terms.</li></ul><p>     </p><h4>Lockdown due to COVID 19 restrictions</h4><p>In the event that the university introduces stricter measures due to COVID 19, the course may be switched to being fully online. Experimental results and reporting information will be provided on LEARN and the students will proceed to submit their reports to the dropbox on LEARN.  Quizzes will be administered and completed on LEARN and the grade allocated for the remaining performance grade will be reallocated to the respective report grade.</p><p>In the event that the on campus exam gets cancelled, there will be no online exam on LEARN. The grade allocated for the exam will instead be redistributed evenly to the grade representing the report grades (depending on when the lockdown occurs).   </p><p> </p><p>***Occasionally, once the term gets under way, a situation will arise which requires an experimental procedure to be modified. If it becomes necessary to modify a laboratory protocol after laboratory manuals have been distributed, the revised procedure will be posted on the LEARN course site.</p>

<h4>Turnitin</h4><p>In the biochemistry lab, all lab reports must be written on an individual basis. While you and your partner will, on occasion, share the same raw data, all processed data, calculations and graphs should be unique to each individual. Plagiarism (to any extent) will not be tolerated. Anyone in possession of an old lab report will receive a mark of zero for that experiment. Copied lab reports will receive a mark of zero. Anyone suspected of plagiarism will be penalized. Plagiarism and copying infractions apply to students taking the course in the same term as well as previous year’s reports. All cases will be reported to the associate Dean of Science.  </p><p><i>To ensure academic integrity, CHEM237L will employ the use of <u>Turnitin</u>. Students will be required to submit an electronic copy of their report to the Turnitin <u>dropbox</u> on the CHEM237L LEARN course website. An “originality report” and “AI detection score" will be generated for each report submitted. </i></p><p><i>NOTE: Turnitin is also capable of detecting AI (Artificial intelligent) generated text. </i></p><p><i>Students have a right to decline the use of Turnitin. Students who wish to opt out of submitting electronic versions of their reports to Turnitin must notify the instructor at the beginning of the term. In such cases, an alternative option will be made </i></p><p>For detailed information regarding academic integrity, please refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/academic-policies-and-procedures#:~:text=The%20Faculty%20of%20Science%20endorses,understanding%20and%20following%20University%20policies.">Faculty of Science Academic Integrity</a>.</p><p> </p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.
