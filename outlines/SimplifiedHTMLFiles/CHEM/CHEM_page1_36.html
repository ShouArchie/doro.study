  Instructor &amp; TA (Teaching Assistant) Information
</h2>
<div>
<p>The course instructor is Dr. Harmeen Deol (e-mail: hkdeol@uwaterloo.ca, office ESC 147). The lab instructor, Harmeen Deol, should be contacted regarding lab absences, grade discrepancies, and AccessAbility requirements. If you have any questions or concerns, you can consult with Harmeen in person, during your scheduled lab period, virtually during a scheduled meeting time or via email. For emails, expect a response within a 24 hour period from Monday to Friday but due to the recent increase in construction-related events (e.g. flooding, power shutdowns) there may be delays (weekends will not follow this rule). It is recommended that you use your UWaterloo e-mail account to avoid any e-mail security issues (e.g. a communications sent from hotmail accounts are often filtered out as spam). All e-mails should include your name, student ID number, course ID and number, course section and experiment title. </p><p>The teaching assistants assigned to the course are available for consultation on experiment and report preparation and report feedback at any time during their regularly scheduled laboratory period(s) or by special arrangement. Any concerns regarding the marking of lab assignments should first be directed to the teaching assistant that marked your report.</p>

<h4><strong>Pre-Lab and Post-Lab assignment</strong></h4><p><br/>Pre-lab submissions will be required for all in-lab procedures. These submissions will be completed and submitted on their respective Quiz tools on LEARN.  In order to have a successful experience, it is important to come to the lab prepared for each lab period. Post-lab reports will require the presentation and analysis of data followed by responding to questions relating to the related concepts. These too are to completely <strong><u>typed and submitted as one PDF file </u></strong>to their respective Dropbox on LEARN .</p><p>The following schedule of tasks have been incorporated to ensure your preparation and completion of each In-lab experience. </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Steps</strong></td><td><strong>Task</strong></td><td><i><strong>Due</strong></i></td><td><i><strong>Lates</strong></i></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Pre-Lab quiz</strong></td><td><strong>Due at 2:30pm</strong> prior to the respective lab </td><td> - <strong>No Lates</strong>: if not completed, a grade of "0" will be assigned</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><strong>Pre-Lab Assignments (with due date)</strong></td><td>Due <strong>Sunday</strong> night prior to the respective lab week</td><td>- <strong>No Lates</strong>: if not submitted, a grade of "0" will be assigned</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><strong>Post-Lab Reports (with due date)</strong></td><td>Due at <strong>2:30pm, the week after the experiment</strong> was performed (unless an alternative due date has been published). </td><td>-<strong> A deduction of 10%</strong> for each day late up to three days (a "0" grade for late submissions later than three days) </td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Occasionally, once the term gets under way, a situation will arise which requires an experimental procedure to be modified. To avoid having an out-of-date copy of an experimental procedure, <strong>students should not print out laboratory experiments more than one week in advance</strong>.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term and in the outline below, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.<br/><br/>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as report writing, biochemistry fundamentals, and procedure development. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of Policy 71 (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (ICAI, n.d.).<br/><br/>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your OWN rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.<br/><br/>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence<br/><br/>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: <br/>·Student Success Office for help with skills like notetaking and time management <br/>· Writing and Communication Centre for assignments with writing or presentations <br/>· AccessAbility Services for documented accommodations <br/>· Library for research-based assignments

<h4><strong>COVID-19 Accommodations</strong></h4><p>It is possible that another wave of COVID-19  can cause school to shut down. It is also possible that a student becomes ill and is unable to complete all course assessments/requirements. The following policy address both these circumstances. If by chance, a circumstance occurs that is not mentioned in the policy below, an alternative <u>sensible</u> arrangement will be made between the instructor and student/s. Any concerns you have with the policy below should be addressed to the instructor, Harmeen Deol.</p><p><strong>In the event that the UW campus is shut down and on-campus activities cease: </strong></p><ul><li>The <strong>in-lab performance grade</strong> will reflect the performance achieved up until the last day on campus.</li><li>The<strong> practical exam</strong> will be cancelled and its grade contribution removed. The final tallied grade will be calculated from a denominator of 92 instead of 100.</li><li>The <strong>final written exam</strong> may or may not be conducted remotely.</li><li>The <strong>pre-lab quizzes and assignments </strong>will continue as is</li><li>The <strong>post-lab reports</strong> will continue with data that is provided to you by the instructor via LEARN or email.</li><li><strong>Group projects:</strong> In-lab portion will be cancelled and an alternative assignment will be proposed</li></ul><p><strong>In the event that a student becomes ill: </strong></p><ul><li>If you are sick and feel that you should not attend the lab in person, you <strong>must</strong> obtain a verification of illness form or declare your illness according to UWaterloo guidelines.</li><li>Please follow the instructions found on the Science Undergraduate Office page for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-other-extenuating-circumstances">SUO illness accommodations</a>.</li><li>If you are missing a component of the course due to valid reasoning, you should always inform the instructor at the earliest time possible. An alternate arrangement or schedule will be discussed between you and the instructor.</li><li>The <strong>in-lab performance grade</strong> will reflect your performance achieved on only the days present in the lab. This only applies for up to one missed lab day. If you miss more than one lab day an incomplete (INC) or in-progress (IP) grade may be assigned.</li><li>If your absence due to illness coincides with the <strong>practical exam</strong> date, you may be asked to complete it on another day or the respective grade will be removed from the grading scheme. The final tallied grade will be calculated from a denominator of 92 instead of 100.</li><li>If your absence due to illness coincides with the <strong>written exam </strong>date, an alternative date will be arranged between you and the instructor (in most cases the student will write during the next offering of the course). An INC or IP grade may be assigned.</li><li>If your illness causes the inability to complete one <strong>online quiz</strong>, the quiz grade will be redistributed to another course component (the final exam). If <strong>more than one quiz</strong> is missed, the respective grade allocations for the missed quizzes will be removed when tallying the final grade denominator. <i>Note: this only applies if you are ill.</i></li><li>If your illness causes your inability to complete <strong>one in-lab experiment</strong>, you may be asked to complete it on another day or lab results/data will be sent to you via email. You will be responsible for completing the post-lab report by the original due date. If you miss more than one lab day, an incomplete (INC) or in-progress (IP) grade may be assigned.</li><li>If a prolonged illness causes your inability to submit either <strong>more than one pre-lab assignment or more than one post-lab report </strong>an INC or IP grade may be assigned.</li></ul><p> </p><p>All graded reports/assessments should be retained until the final course marks are released and reviewed. <strong>For this term, all lab submissions will be ONLINE- on LEARN.</strong></p><p><strong>If not able to perform/write the lab exam during the term, a make-up lab exams will be performed/written with the next course offering (an IP or INC grade will be documented in the interim). </strong>CHEM 335L is offered every Fall and Winter term.<strong> Student travel plans are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time. </strong>The final written exam for CHEM 335L will take place during the last laboratory period for the term.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills.
