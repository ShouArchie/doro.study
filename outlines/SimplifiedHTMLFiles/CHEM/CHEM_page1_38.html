<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Participation:</strong>  All students enrolled in CHEM 340 are expected to attempt and complete all CHEM 340 practice exercises, practice exercise quizzes and hand-in exercises.</p><p>If a student is unable to complete and/or submit a practice exercise quiz and/or hand-in exercise due to illness lasting more than seven (7) consecutive days, it is the student's responsibility to contact the course instructor, by e-mail, preferably within 48 hours, but no more than 72 hours.  Have a medical practitioner complete a Verification of Illness Form (VIF).  Email a scanned copy of the VIF to the course instructor.  In your email to the course instructor, provide your name UW student ID number, and exactly what course activity you missed.  A copy of the completed VIF must be submitted to the Science Undergraduate Office.  The dates of illness on the VIF must include the date the student was not able to complete the course activity, otherwise the VIF will be considered invalid and will not be accepted.  It is imperative that you contact the course instructor and Science Undergraduate Office as soon as you are well enough to do so.  Any student failing to provide a VIF within a reasonable time line, will receive a mark of zero for their practice exercise quiz and/or hand-in exercise. The policy above applies to missing the computational project deadlines.</p><p>Any other reasons other than illness, such as travel plans, are not considered acceptable grounds for not completing a CHEM 340 practice exercise quiz, hand-in exercise, and/or any portion of the computational chemistry project.  Students are expected to make plans such that do not conflict with the CHEM 340 Course Schedule.  Situations where alternative plans cannot be made, students must inform the course instructor <strong>within one week of the start of the academic term</strong>, so that alternative arrangements can be made.  Students are required to submit a copy of any official supporting documentation before any special accommodations will be considered.  Students should refer to the CHEM 340 Course Schedule, found on the CHEM 340 LEARN site, before scheduling any plans.</p><p>For cases involving extenuating circumstances, the student must provide supporting documentation as to why they are unable to complete a CHEM 340 activity, such as practice exercise quizzes, hand-in exercises and/or any portion of the computational chemistry project.  Supporting documentation will be considered on a case by case basis. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples of supporting documentation include plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates, obituaries, letters from funeral directors, or counselor letters.  Student should contact the course instructor via email, as soon as possible.  The email must include your name, UW student ID number, what course activity you missed, the dates you will not be able to participate in CHEM 340 due to the extenuating circumstances, and a legible copy of the supporting documentation.  Students requiring more than two weeks to be excused from any Chem 340 activities will be required to submit additional supporting documentation, such as a counselor letter.</p><p><strong>Practice Exercises and Practice Exercise Quizzes:</strong>  Students must attempt and complete all CHEM 340 practice exercises, associated with each session.  After completing a practice exercise, students must successfully complete the corresponding practice exercise quiz, by achieving a grade of 100%.  Students are allowed 3 attempts to successfully complete the practice exercise quiz.  If after 3 attempts the student fails to successfully complete a practice exercise quiz all input files must be submitted to the course instructor and/or teaching assistant for further inspection.  Each practice exercise quiz consists of 3 randomly chosen questions pertaining to the associated practice exercise.</p><p><strong>Submitting Hand-in Exercises for Grading:</strong>  All CHEM 340 hand-in exercises will be submitted using Crowdmark.  Crowdmark is an online marking system.  Due dates for the hand-in exercises can be found on the CHEM 340 Course Schedule post on LEARN.</p><p> All answers must be clearly legible.  Any answers that cannot be read will not be graded.  All text must be typed.  Equations should be created using the Equation Editor found in MS-Word or a comparable equation editor.  Text written by hand will NOT be graded. It is recommended all answers to be uploaded using a PDF format</p><p><strong>Re-grading Hand-in Exercises:</strong>  If there a concern related as to how a hand-in exercise was graded, the student should first consult the teaching assistant responsible for marking the hand-in exercise.  If a resolution between the student and teaching assistant cannot be found, the course instructor will re-grade the <u>entire</u> hand-in exercise. The mark assigned by course instructor will be final.</p><p>Please refer to the <strong>Introduction</strong> section of the Chem 340 course notes for all rules and penalties associated with Chem 340.</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
