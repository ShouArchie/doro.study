<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments and examinations in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented and that academic integrity exist on both examination and assignment submissions.  Students will be given an option if they do not want to have their assignment screened by Turnitin®.  If you have concerns about using Turnitin or would like to opt out of using it, please contact your Instructor by the end of Week 1 to discuss alternate arrangements to submit your assignment. Please note that direct use and copying from AI tools such as ChatGPT will also be considered an academic integrity offence.  
</p>
<a></a>
<h2>
  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>This course will be delivered with in person lectures. In such circumstances courses will not automatically record lectures. Permission from the instructor is required prior to recording of lectures. When permission is granted the use of all course recordings is strictly limited to the purpose of private/personal study and for no other reason (e.g., loaning the recording or reproducing a copy for another student, contesting grading, posting in whole or part online, etc.).  Any failure to abide by these requirements is a violation of the university's academic integrity requirements and is subject to proceedings under Policy 71, Student Discipline.   </p>
</div>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Attendance at the Registered Section</h4><p> You are assigned to a specific section for instructor grading and office hours.  If you require a change, please contact the instructor. It is not appropriate to attend a session you are not enrolled in, without talking to the instructor first</p><h4>Accommodations</h4><p>Students who experience an extenuating circumstance (e.g. illness, injury, varsity tournaments, academic conferences) that is sufficiently significant to temporarily render them unable to meet academic requirements must contact their instructor as soon as possible and be prepared to submit verification. The weighting of the missed evaluation may be added to the final examination weighting.</p><p>You can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-my-illness">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest in certain situations. For other illnesses, obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">verification of illness form</a> (VIF) and submit it electronically to the Science Undergraduate Office (SUO).</p><p>When an evaluation is missed due to illness, the student should be prepared to provide a verification of illness. This information will be used to determine if the student is eligible for consideration. The dates affected and degree of incapacitation will be used to determine follow-up action. Students should ensure that their health care provider indicates this type of information on the medical certificate. For example, “was seen” or “attended emergency Dept on...” are not acceptable. The University of Waterloo <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">verification of illness form</a> is available online. Any University of Waterloo student can go to University of Waterloo Health Services, but the VIF form can also be filled out by non-UWaterloo healthcare professionals.</p><p>Although illness may constitute a valid reason for missing an exam, it does not automatically entitle a student to an alternate exam. If an alternate exam time is provided, it is expected that it will as soon as possible after a student returns to class. In some instances, students may be asked to write the exam the next time the course is offered.</p><p>The University acknowledges that, due to the pluralistic nature of the University community, some students may seek accommodations on religious grounds. Accordingly, students must consult with their instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought. Failure to provide a timely request will decrease the likelihood of providing an accommodation.</p><h4>Regulations for Academic Discipline</h4><p><strong>What is an Academic Offense?</strong></p><p>Offenses include the following:</p><ul><li>Plagiarism on written assignments.</li><li>Inappropriate citations on written assignments.</li><li>Cheating on exams or tests.</li><li>Double submission of material.</li><li>Fraudulent use of medical certificates.</li><li>Sharing of assignment answers (excessive collaboration) will result in cheating penalties for both individuals, regardless of intent.</li></ul><p><strong>Avoidance of Academic Offenses</strong></p><p>All students are expected to know what constitutes an academic offense and thereby avoid committing them by doing the following: </p><ul><li>Thoroughly familiarize yourself with <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a>.</li><li>Understand that any work submitted will be assumed to be the work of the individual student (other types of submission, i.e., group or teams, must be clearly indicated by the Instructor or Teaching Assistant for the course).</li><li>Only permitted material will be allowed on your desk during the examination period (pen, pencil, exam paper, and approved, designated calculator, if needed).</li></ul><p><strong>Resolution of Academic Offenses</strong></p><p>Any activity that contravenes <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> is deemed an academic offense and will be followed up with the Instructor for the course in the following manner: </p><ul><li>Teaching Assistants will bring all cases (suspected or otherwise) of academic dishonesty to the attention of the Instructor.</li><li>For written assignments, the material will not be handed back.</li><li>The students will be required to meet with the Instructor to discuss the infraction.</li><li>Instructors must notify the Associate Dean of the infraction in writing with all supporting evidence.</li></ul><p>First offenses, depending on the severity of the infraction, will be handled as outlined below:</p><ul><li>A mark of 0 will be given for the assignment by the Instructor.</li><li>A letter of offense and grade change, signed by the Instructor and student, will be forwarded to the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies, Faculty of Science.</li><li>Copies of this letter will be placed in the student's file.</li></ul><p>More serious offenses or second academic infractions will be handled on an individual basis by the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies, Faculty of Science. </p><h4>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)</h4><p><strong> </strong>GenAI trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, video, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of GenAI and expectations for using GenAI, will be discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions for short film component. Unless otherwise specified, use of GenAI is expressly forbidden. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
