<div>
<div>SOC 417:</div>
<p>This course examines the relationship between higher education and society. Students will analyze major trends, how and why students are stratified across fields of study and various kinds of postsecondary institutions, and the relationship between education and the labour market.</p>

<p>Postsecondary “Higher” Education is a sociologically important organizational field—one that is key to questions of economic mobility, civic engagement, and healthy democracies. In this course we will engage with a variety of readings primarily about Canadian and American post-secondary education. We will focus on both micro-individual lived experience and macro-organizational structure. Our core questions will include: Does higher education lead to mobility or reproduce inequality? How does the experience of university vary by race/ethnicity, social class, gender, and other characteristics? As current post-secondary students, you bring your own auto-ethnographic accounts to this course. Those accounts are valued and add to our emphasis on learning how to understand and apply sociological theories and research methods to the study of higher education.</p>

<p><i>PERSONAL EDUCATIONAL BIOGRAPHY AND PRELIMINARY REFLECTION PAPER- Due January 24 no later than 11:59pm (15%)</i></p><p>This short 2-3 page reflection on your own experiences in higher education asks you to reflect on what questions about university you still have as a fourth year student. This will allow me to better get to know you and to ensure course content addresses areas of interest bridging the personal and the sociological</p><p><i>BOOK REVIEW (30%)- Due March 11 no later than 11:59pm </i></p><p>Twenty plus years out of my own undergraduate education, I do not remember the tests or the nuances of every journal article I read. But, I do remember the good books some of which I still have on my shelf. Writing a book review is a key academic skill for those of you who may pursue graduate level work in the social sciences and the ability to summarize and critically evaluate information is a skill transferable across many professions. In this assignment you will choose a book from Appendix A (at the end of this syllabus) or in consultation with me and write a 6-8pp review that summarizes the book's key arguments and offers discussion and constructive critique. Further guidelines will be posted on LEARN.</p><p><i>GROUP FACILITATION OF CLASS SEGMENT (30%)- Varies, Schedule to be Determined by Reading Week</i></p><p>One of the best ways to learn material is by being compelled to explain it clearly and succinctly to other people in ways that are accessible and engaging. In this assignment, you will be grouped with people who share similar interests and tasked with designing learning activities for your peers. This will also allow us to explore topics within the sociology of higher education that are of special interest. In the second half of term, we will devote one half of each class to these student-led discussions. We will also devote one class session to organizing this work—given that this time slot is one that every group member is available. Class leaders will be evaluated on the basis of thoughtfulness, depth of discussion, and analytical insight demonstrated in their leadership sessions. More detailed assignment guidelines will be posted in LEARN. </p><p><i>ACTIVE ACADEMIC CITIZENSHIP DURING OTHER GROUP PRESENTATIONS (10%)</i></p><p>You may be familiar with the scene in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off where the instructor in a deadpan voice says “anybody, anybody….” It is hard to lead a class when no one is participating. Our time together will be richer if you fully engage by offering comments, posing questions, participating in activities, or writing thoughtful notes/emails that show you were actively engaging. At the end of the semester, I will ask you to complete a brief self-assessment that suggests a grade. I will be evaluating your self-assessment in assigning the final grade for this component of the course. The rubric for self-assessment will be posted on LEARN.</p><p><i>TAKE HOME EXAM (10%) - Due April 4</i></p><p>The final exam for this course will ask you to consider what we’ve read and discussed might mean for the future of higher education. How can sociology inform university leaders and government policy makers interested in providing the best possible experience for students, for communities, and for the nation? In this short 2-3 page double-spaced final reflection you will outline what you see as the most pressing social problem in higher education and offer a solution that is supported by sociological theories/empirical data. This should not require new research but rather offers you an opportunity to review and reflect on the many things that have been covered in class sessions, student-led presentations, and the book you reviewed.</p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as finding, synthesizing and evaluating information. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc).

If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.
