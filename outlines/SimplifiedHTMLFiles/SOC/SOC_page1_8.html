  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>SOC 223R:</div>
<p>The deviance-making process is examined in a variety of social contexts. This course examines the emergence of rules and control agencies, the processes by which people become involved in deviant activities, and the contingencies affecting their careers as deviants.</p>
<div>
<p><a href="https://acal.fast.uwaterloo.ca/course/1251/SOC/223R" target="_blank">View requirements for SOC 223R</a></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>This course begins with helping students to understand how the study of “deviants” and deviant behaviour has changed and developed over time: from theories of demonology and evil (pre-scientific approaches), the theoretical and empirical developments of the classical era, and the positivistic, interaction, and critical perspectives. Each paradigmatic shift and theoretical development explore how people have been categorized as ‘normal’ or ‘deviant’ on the basis of various attributes, behaviours, and changes in epistemology. What are the forces at play in determining who is considered deviant and who is considered normal? </p><p>This course will examine various sociological theories and debates regarding conformity and deviation; labeling processes; and aspects of ‘formal control’ in the form of ideology and moral entrepreneurship. Who labels people deviant? Why? How? We will examine some of these issues/theories in conjunction with important issues of today. Students will be encouraged to be reflective about how they participate in social deviance as both conformists and deviants and to be critical of the construction of normative orders. Finally, it is the goal of this course to assist students in finding the study of deviance both engaging and sociologically interesting. </p>

<p><strong><u>Attendance Policy</u>: </strong></p><p>Come to class each week. You learn more that way and your grade in the course will be higher.</p><p><strong><u>Lecture Schedule and Course Format</u>:            </strong></p><p>The class will be made up of lectures, student facilitated discussion presentations, and a film.</p><p>On non-presentation/discussion weeks, lectures will run for the full 3 hours (with a break). On weeks when discussion presentations are scheduled, lectures will run for approximately 1 hour and 30 mins. Regular weekly attendance for the full class is essential in order to do well in the course. Should you miss a class, it is your responsibility to obtain missed notes from another student. I will not supply students with a copy of my lecture notes. </p><h2>Electronic Device Policy</h2><p><strong>The use of mobile computing devices in the classroom is limited to notetaking and accessing course material. Any other personal use of electronics is not to take place during class time</strong>. Do not use electronic devices to photograph or record (audio or video) class members, instructors, or guests without their expressed permission and consent. At no time are students allowed to record classroom lectures or activities unless approved by the professor prior to the beginning of the course. Violators of this policy will face academic sanctions. <strong>USING YOUR CELL PHONE IS NOT PERMITTED DURING CLASS TIME. They should be turned off and put away.</strong></p><p><strong><u>Participation (15%)</u>:  </strong></p><p>15% of your grade in this course is based on your participation in the discussions generated by your fellow students’ presentations as well as the opportunities to engage in discussion during lecture. Your comments should be thoughtful, academically savvy, and show your ability to use a sociological imagination. Participating each week is strongly encouraged and will earn you a high mark out of 15. It goes without saying that all participation in this course will be respectful. Any comments that are hurtful, homophobic, transphobic, racist, ethnically or religiously offensive will not be tolerated. </p><p><strong><u>Discussion Presentation and Written Report (25%)</u>:</strong></p><p><strong><u>This assignment has 2 components</u></strong>: </p><ol><li>Facilitating a class discussion with 2 other students on a sociologically, well researched and presented topic of deviance</li><li>Each student in the group will submit their own research report that is based on the sociological research findings used in the presentation</li></ol><p>Each student/group member will receive their <strong>own</strong> grade that is based on components 1 and 2. </p><p>Please refer to and follow the guideline for this assignment which is posted on LEARN.</p><p><strong><u>Component 1</u></strong>: GROUP DISCUSSION PRESENTATION</p><p>Each student will work in a group with 2 (or 3) other students (depending on final enrolment in the course). Choose a topic in which you are all interested. Once you have chosen, email me what you've decided and I will keep a running list of "taken" topics, that will be available for everyone to see on our course's Home Page and update it as topics come in. </p><p><strong><u>NOTE</u>: <u>YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN ASSIGNED A GROUP</u>. Please go the "Connect" tab, then the "Groups" tab on our LEARN page to find your group number. You can then go to the course outline and find your group's presentation date. </strong>Groups have been preassigned to avoid the issues that come with "self-enrolment", including the failure to sign up for a group. </p><p>The presentation should take approximately 30-35 minutes. Students are encouraged to be creative and sociologically thoughtful while constructing their presentations as <strong>the primary goal of the assignment is to facilitate a class discussion</strong> (not lecture) about the selected topic. Be critical, insightful, and academic in your work. Let your presentation and discussion questions for the class show that you have given the topic some serious, sociological thought. Your presentation should also be properly referenced using only academic sources.  </p><p><u>Some ideas for presentations</u>: School shootings, fentanyl overdoes crisis, serial murder, human trafficking, intimate stalking, intimate partner violence, terrorism, suicide, eating disorders, corporate crime... of course these are just ideas and you are welcome to choose something else that is of interest to your group. </p><p><i><strong>I encourage each group member to contribute equally</strong></i> in preparation for the presentation, and during the presentation in front of the class. </p><p>Presenting an academic argument or a position to a large group can be an invaluable experience. It is my hope that you will take advantage of this opportunity to hone your skills and add to your CV/resume at the same time. </p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Component 2:</u></strong> INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH REPORT</p><p>Each student/group member will submit their own research report that details the findings used in the presentation. This formal research report should be approximately 4-5 pages long, properly referenced, and presented using proper sentence structure and grammar. This written assignment will be due one week after the group presentation and submitted using Turnitin.com via the Dropbox. </p><p>A detailed outline for this component can be found on our LEARN page. </p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Midterm Exam (25%)</u>:</strong></p><p>The test, which is scheduled for February 25th, 2025, will be multiple choice. It will be based entirely on lecture material, the film, and the assigned readings up until the week of the test. This exam will take place during regular class time and in our regular classroom. </p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Final Paper (35%)</u>:</strong></p><p>The final paper for the course can be submitted via Turnitin.com between April 1st and April 4th, 2025 (by 11:59 pm) without penalty. Late papers without accommodation after April 4th will receive a late penalty of 5% per day. Please note that <u>failure to submit a final paper will result in failing the course. </u></p><p>The final paper is a creative and unique exercise in micro theory application. You will be using the theory outlined in the book “Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity” (1963) by Erving Goffman. I strongly recommend that you have an <i>approved</i> essay topic in mind before reading the book as it will save you a ton of time in completing your paper. Both a general essay outline and a detailed essay outline have been posted to LEARN. </p><p>This final essay is a combination of narrative/story-telling, theory application, and a general reflection on the material of the course. You will be asked to write a detailed narrative about how you (or someone you know) is ‘deviant’. (Note: for the purposes of this class, we are all deviant!). This is meant to be written from a very micro perspective in that it is about personal experience. You will then apply Goffman’s theory of Stigma to that narrative using a minimum of 15 concepts from the theory. Your final section of the paper will require you to compare/contrast/couch Goffman’s theory with what you have learned throughout the course. This is a very unique essay experience and it is meant to be a combination of both personal reflection and academic application.</p><p>Despite the essay ‘feeling’ informal at times, you are still required to reference your work properly and construct it in a way that combines both personal experience and academic prose. Your paper should not exceed 12 written pages. </p><h2>Late or Incomplete Work</h2><p>Failure to hand in the final paper on the assigned due date (without formal academic accommodations) will result in a deduction of 5% per day including weekends. Failure to come to class on the day of your group presentation (without a doctor’s note and/or formal academic accommodations) will result in a score of “0”. Missing the midterm (without a doctor’s note and/or formal academic accommodations) will result in a score of “0”. </p><h2>Coursework Submission Policy</h2><p>In order to pass the course, each student must write the midterm examination, prepare and present with their group a presentation on the agreed upon date and submit their presentation slides on the class’s LEARN site no later than 11:59 pm the day before the presentation, and hand in a final paper via turnitin.com. </p>
