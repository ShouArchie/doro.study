<p>In this course, we will examine aging as a social process. In the first part of the course, we will learn to understand aging as a socially constructed phenomenon. We will discover how our views on old age have changed throughout history and how our culture shapes social attitudes towards aging. During the second part of the course, we will examine the influence of social structures on the experiences of aging. We will take a close look at inequities that are produced by gender and ethnicity and learn about differential access to healthy and successful aging. In the final part of the course, we will critically assess the social and financial supports available to older adults in our society. We will examine what can we do to ensure that older adults in Canada have better access to adequate housing, social and financial stability, health care, and “good death”. Research activities embedded in the course will allow us to apply what we have learned to practice.</p>

<h2>Midterm (20%) and Final Exam (25%)</h2><h3>Why do we need to use midterm and final exams as assessments? </h3><p>Exams are an effective way to evaluate your knowledge in a somewhat objective manner. I can ask you questions that test your understanding of the readings, lectures, and class discussions, and assess your level of comprehension in relation to that of your peers. Moreover, exams also help me to see if I did my job right: If I see that some of the questions were not answered correctly by most students, it means I need to better explain this topic. This is why exams are an effective way for us all to understand how we absorb the learned material. </p><h3>How exams will be structured? </h3><p>The Midterm Exam (see the schedule) will be administered during the class time. It is worth 20% of the final grade and will be composed of 40 multiple choice questions. You will have 70 minutes to complete the exam. The Final Exam will be 25% of the final grade and will have 50 multiple-choice questions. The Final Exam will be administered during the Final Examination period.  </p><h3> <br/>What if you miss a Midterm?  </h3><p>Life happens and sometimes our performance might be negatively impacted by what is happening in our personal lives. If you miss your Midterm Exam or do poorly on it, you will have an option to transfer your Midterm mark to the Final Exam (so, your final exam will be worth 45% instead of 25%).   </p><h2>Class Engagement (20%):</h2><h3>Why do we have class engagement as an assessment? </h3><p>I believe that the best way to learn is to think about the content and apply it to your own experiences. In this class, we will have regular workshops and other activities that will help you to apply the learned material. Engaging with the content we learn in this way will help you to retain the information, to do better on your research project and feel more prepared for the Exams. For us, your instructional team, engagement activities can help to “check-in” with the class and identify any topics or concepts that may need to be explained again.  </p><h3>How engagement activities will be structured? </h3><p>Each week, we will have an engagement activity in class - you can work on it as a group or individually. Each engagement activity would count as 1.5% of your grade for a total of 15% (10 activities per term).  </p><h3>What if you missed an engagement activity and/or missed a class?  </h3><p>I appreciate that students have many different roles and responsibilities and that sometimes you may need to miss classes due to illness or personal circumstances. I built in the option to miss two engagement activities, which means you will have 12 opportunities throughout the course to complete 10 required activities. </p><p> </p><h2>Research Project    </h2><p>You will be expected to complete a mini-research project. You will conduct a semi-structured interview with an older adult. The goal of this assignment is to explore how the aging process is shaped by social and individual factors and to try yourself as a researcher in the field of social gerontology. Over the course of working on this assignment, you will develop (or improve) your skills and knowledge in qualitative research design and methodology, critical analysis and appraisal, and writing. We will have weekly workshops during class time to prepare you for research-related activities. You will be required to submit a number of assignments:</p><figure><img src="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/content/enforced/1112403-GERON_HLTH_KIN_REC_SOC352_eneiterm_1251/Syllabus/image_20250103075331990.png?ou=1112403"/></figure><p> </p><h3><strong>Part 1: Research Paperwork (3%)</strong></h3><p>The goal of this assignment is to prepare you for your role as a researcher. Conducting research with human participants is a privilege. As researchers, we should ensure that we do not abuse this privilege and that we treat our research participants with respect.  </p><p>n order to participate in research-related activities, you must familiarize yourself with Tri-Council Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans available at <a href="https://www.pre.ethics.gc.ca/eng/policy-politique_tcps2-eptc2_2022.html">https://www.pre.ethics.gc.ca/eng/policy-politique_tcps2-eptc2_2022.html</a>  Each student also has to complete an online Course on Research Ethics (CORE) tutorial available at <a href="https://tcps2core.ca/welcome">https://tcps2core.ca/welcome</a> </p><p>Before beginning your research activities, you are required to review and/or modify four documents that you will need for conducting your research project:</p><ol><li>Recruitment flyer</li><li>Letter of Information and Consent Form</li><li>Interview Guide, and</li><li>Feedback letter.</li></ol><p>To complete Part 1 of the research activities, you would need to submit via Dropbox:</p><ul><li>Copy of CORE certificate (provided to you once you complete the tutorial)</li><li>Recruitment flyer (with your contact information on it)</li><li>Letter of information and consent form (with your contact information)</li><li>Interview guide</li><li>Feedback letter (with your contact information)</li></ul><p><i><strong>Please note that you are NOT allowed to engage in ANY research-related activities (including recruitment) until you received an explicit email from your course instructor or your TA that your documents have been approved and the permission to conduct research has been granted. </strong></i></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Part 2: Interview Transcript (7%) </strong></h3><p>The goal of this assignment is to develop (or hone) your qualitative interviewing skills and to provide you with an opportunity to learn about the life experiences of older adults. </p><p>Upon receiving permission to begin your research, you will be required to recruit ONE older adult to participate in semi-structured interview of approximately 30 minutes. We will practice the technique of semi-structured qualitative interviewing during the workshop in class. You will be required to provide an older adult with the letter of information and consent form, to explain the research process to them, and to have them sign a consent form if they agree to take part in your research project.</p><p>With the permission of the participant, you will audio-record the interview. Upon completion of the interview, you will provide the participant with the feedback letter. You will then have to transcribe the interview, remove all identifiable information (e.g. their name or reference to someone’s name), and submit the transcript and the consent form via LEARN Dropbox. </p><p><i><strong>Please note that this part of the assignment can be done in a group of two students interviewing ONE older adult. If this is the case, students must clearly identify each interviewer, as each student will receive an individual grade for the assignment </strong></i></p><h3><strong>Part 3: Research Paper (20%)</strong></h3><p>The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your critical analysis and writing skills. This assignment will also demonstrate that you can think critically and apply what you have learned in this class to everyday life. You will submit a short research paper that will be based on the interview that you conducted with an older adult. Your paper will be 5 pages long. </p><p>You will have to submit two copies of your paper – one (regular copy) will be submitted to LEARN Dropbox. The other copy will be anonymized (e.g. you will remove your name and student number from the title page) and submitted for blind peer review to peerScholar. </p><h3><strong>Part 4: Peer Review Assessment 5% x 2 (10%)</strong></h3><p>The goal of this review is to provide you with an opportunity to develop critical appraisal skills and to give students constructive feedback to improve their papers. You will receive two anonymous papers for review and evaluation. You will be required to mark the two assignments and to provide detailed comments on the grading rubric which will be provided to you. </p><h3><strong>Part 5: (Optional) Revised Paper (20%) </strong></h3><p>After receiving the anonymous reviews from your peers and the feedback from your TA, you will have an option to revise your paper and resubmit it for a better mark. This submission can improve your mark by a maximum of 10 points (e.g. if you received 80 on the first submission, you will not be able to receive more than 90, even if you address all the comments and concerns raised by the TA and the reviewers). <strong>This is an optional assignment</strong> – you do not have to submit it. If you decide to submit it, you will have to (1) submit a short summary of the changes you have made to the paper in response to the TA’s and reviewers’ comments, and (2) use ‘track changes’ option to show where and how you have made the changes to your paper.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
