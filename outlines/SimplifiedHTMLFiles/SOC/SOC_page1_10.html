<div>
<div>GSJ 326 / LS 325 / SOC 325:</div>
<p>Despite the commonly held belief that sexuality is nothing more than "doing what comes naturally," cultural definitions, including prohibitions against specific forms of conduct, impinge upon the most private or intimate of acts. This course examines the social construction and control of sexuality through law.</p>

<p>Welcome to Sexuality and the Law! </p><p>Few topics incite fascination and curiosity as sexuality and the law. However, what we consider “normal” and what we consider deviant is socially constructed. Furthermore, laws in place to control behaviour are socially constructed as well. In the following weeks, we will explore in detail what makes up our values, norms, and morals surrounding sexual behaviour and our responses to it. As such, this course aims to answer two questions. First, why do we interpret certain types of sexual behaviour as violations of norms and values? Second, why do we respond to these sexual behaviours in the way that we do? </p><p>This course is made up of two broad areas. We will begin by situating ourselves through an examination of how sexual behaviours and mores are socially constructed and change depending on social context. We will examine how ideas around appropriate sexual behaviour change over time and discuss the various explanations put forth to explain sexual offending. We will move to examining specific types of sexual offences, from the more minor crimes to the most serious. We will wrap up the course with an understanding of how we respond and treat sexual offenders. </p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The topics covered in this course range from low-level behaviours to the much more serious and violent sex offences. As such, it has the potential to be upsetting depending on your personal experiences. These topics are not sensationalized yet may lead to some discomfort for students. Please feel free to come to me should you experience any difficulties with the course material. These discussions will be confidential and we will work through solutions together. A resource list is posted on LEARN which outlines supports available to students, both on- and off-campus.</p>

<p><i><strong>Discussion (10%)</strong></i></p><p>For the discussion assignment, students will be placed into predetermined groups on LEARN. For the discussion, questions will be posted and students are required to complete two posts. In the first post, students will answer the questions posed. In the second post, students are to answer/reply to a post of someone else in the group. In the reply post, students are to go beyond simply regurgitating their original post, or a simple “I agree with you in the following ways”. Students should use the reply post to ask questions, to critically assess the original post, or, for example, to suggest ways the topic or issue has been presented in the popular media. </p><p>However, it is imperative that all discussions and posts remain constructive and polite. In this assignment we are critically engaging with the material, not with each other. Any post that is not a fair and constructive treatment of your group member’s ideas will receive an automatic 0. These posts are graded out of 10. The first five marks are allocated to the original post; the last 5 marks are allocated to the reply post. The discussion board will be open from Monday-Sunday on the week they are due. Posts will not be accepted after the board closes.</p><p><i><strong>Midterm (25%)</strong></i></p><p>The midterm will take place in class on March 6. It will cover all lecture and text material from weeks 1 to 7. The test will be a combination of short and long answers. More information about the test will be given before Reading Week.</p><p><i><strong>Workshop Assignment (25%)</strong></i></p><p>The goal of this written assignment is to not only provide the opportunity to build and enhance your writing and critical analysis skills but also to make connections between course content and practical solutions. There is a written assignment folder on LEARN where you will find readings and detailed instructions. This assignment is due in the dropbox on LEARN Sunday, March 30th at 11:59 pm. The assignment will be screened by plagiarism detection software TurnItIn and any use of Chat GPT/generative AI is not allowed and will be considered academic misconduct.</p><p><i><strong>Final Exam (40%)</strong></i></p><p>The final exam will be scheduled by the Registrar’s Office and will take place during the exam period. While the exam is cumulative, there will be a greater emphasis on material discussed weeks 7 to 13. The final exam will consist of short and long answer questions. More information on the exact format will be given in the last couple of weeks of class.</p><p> </p>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples.

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. </p><p>Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information">Quest</a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p>
