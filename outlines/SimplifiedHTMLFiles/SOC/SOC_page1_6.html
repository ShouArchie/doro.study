<p>This course takes a sociological approach to the study of youth and adolescence within a Canadian context. The goals of this course are to understand how the period of adolescent development is socially constructed and how the ‘lived experiences’ of youth are influenced by the intersections of varying identities and social locations as well as by social institutions such as friends, families and schools. Throughout this course, we will examine the complexity of adolescence and the variability of adolescent experiences from the perspective of critical youth studies.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Course Policies</h3><h4>Late Assignments and Related Concerns</h4><p>Due dates are firm. You are responsible for informing your instructor in advance if you are unable to complete an assignment by the scheduled date. Missed due dates are only acceptable in the case of medical problems (with a medical note), for serious compassionate reasons, or as a pre-arranged accommodation for students with disabilities. Late submissions, without advance permission, will be given a 10% reduction in the total possible grade for each 24-hours after the due date. No assignments will be accepted if submitted more than one week after the deadline.</p><p>Difficulty with assignments is not a sufficient reason for an extension. Any student who finds himself / herself struggling with an assignment during the term is encouraged to meet with the instructor as soon as possible to discuss strategies for success. It is important to begin assignments well in advance of the due date in case of problems.</p><p>Quizzes will be closed on the due dates specified in the Course Schedule.</p><h4>Class and Readings Expectations</h4><p>I like an open, honest and easy going learning environment, with a relaxed, but professional atmosphere. In order to have that type of atmosphere, it requires that you complete your weekly readings, participate in discussion activities and complete assignments. All required readings are found in the readings section of each weekly content page.</p><p>In addition to the required weekly readings, I have included some recommended readings that give you additional insight into current theoretical debates and research being conducted in Canada in the area of Youth Studies. These readings highlight how the everyday lives of youth can be examined through a sociological lens.</p><h3>Department Policies</h3><h4>A Respectful Living and Learning Environment For All</h4><ol><li>It is expected that everyone living, learning or working in the Renison University College community will contribute to an environment of tolerance and respect by treating others with sensitivity and civility.</li><li>Harassment is unwanted attention in the form of jokes, insults, gestures, gossip, or other behaviours that are meant to intimidate. Some instances of harassment are against the law in addition to Renison University College policy.</li><li>Discrimination is treating people differently because of their race, disability, sex, sexual orientation, ancestry, colour, age, creed, marital status, or other personal characteristics. The Ontario Human Rights Code considers actions and behaviours rather than intentions.</li><li>If you experience or witness either harassment or discrimination, you may contact the Director of Human Resources for Renison University College.</li></ol><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of the instructor, which can include:</p><ul><li>lecture handouts and presentations (e.g., PowerPoint slides)</li><li>lecture content, both spoken and written (and any audio or video recording thereof)</li><li>questions from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams)</li><li>work protected by copyright (i.e., any work authored by the instructor)</li></ul><p>Making available the intellectual property of instructors without their express written consent (e.g., uploading lecture notes or assignments to an online repository) is considered theft of intellectual property and subject to disciplinary sanctions as described in Policy 71 – Student Discipline. Students who become aware of the availability of what may be their instructor’s intellectual property in online repositories are encouraged to alert the instructor.</p><h3>Professional Conduct Policy</h3><h4>Preamble</h4><p>The School of Social Work adheres to the Canadian Association for Social Work Education's (CASWE) Accreditation Standards. In abiding by the standards of the national governing body, CASWE, the School of Social Work provides students and the surrounding communities a measure of confidence regarding competent, well-prepared professional social workers at the undergraduate and graduate level.</p><p>The School of Social Work and the agencies providing field education share in the responsibility to assist students to develop the skills to conduct themselves in a professional manner both in the classroom and in the field.</p><h4>Policy Statement</h4><p>The School of Social Work sets expectations of student' conduct consistent with the expectations of professional conduct for practicing social workers. Based upon CASW Code of Ethics as well as workplace ethics, the student is expected to demonstrate commitment to their social work education as well as honesty, responsibility, reliability and courtesy. Communication is the foundation of professional conduct.</p><h4>Procedural Guidelines</h4><p>The student is expected to focus their attention on the class and/or instruction being provided.</p><p>Use of a personal computer or phone for reasons unrelated to course content, is not acceptable during on campus classes.</p><p>Attendance is expected in all social work courses and in the practicum setting. The student must make every effort to inform the instructor as early as possible prior to any absence (on campus or online) in a professional manner.  In last minute circumstances (e.g. accident) the student must notify the instructor at the earliest possible time.</p><p>In order to support the student learning journey in the School of Social Work, students with any unexplained or unjustified absence will be informed of such, in writing, with the Director of the School of Social Work copied in. For professional clarity and consistent communication practices, any further absences will be documented in writing to the student with the Director of the School of Social Work copied in. The Director of the School of Social Work will follow up at their discretion. (Updated October 2014)</p><h4>Petitions, Grievances, Appeals</h4><p>The School of Social Work and Renison University College are committed to the view that when a problem or disagreement arises between a faculty member and a student every effort should be made to resolve the problem through mutual and respectful negotiation. Most issues are resolved by a student/faculty meeting to discuss differences of opinion. It is only after this stage that a student initiates a grievance. Petitions and grievances in the School of Social Work are handled under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70.</a></p><h3>Mental Health Support</h3><p>All of us need a support system.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
