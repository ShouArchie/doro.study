<p>This course builds on the statistics background that students are expected to have from their undergraduate degree. It will begin with a basic review of data handling skills, univariate analysis, and bivariate analysis. From there, standard multivariate analysis techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, and factor analysis will be covered. The course will finish with a focus on more advanced techniques such as Poisson-family regression models, methods for handling cluster sampling (e.g., multilevel models), and interaction effects. Principles of open science and causality will be discussed. This will allow students to address most quantitative research questions. However, each one of these techniques could have a whole course or more devoted strictly to that method. The goal here is to give students some exposure to all of these methods so that they will know the basics and can do the necessary reading and practice required to become proficient with any of the techniques presented in this course should their particular research interests necessitate it.</p>

<p>The Kremelberg text nicely balances the conceptual and mathematical background of commonly used statistical techniques with demonstrations of applications using statistical packages. It’s well over a decade old, but it still works nicely for this course.

<h3>Assignments</h3><p>Students must complete 3 assignments in this course, each worth 15% of their final grade. Each assignment is focused mostly on the material that comes in the weeks immediately preceding it, but since the skills build on each other, the assignments will include material from throughout the term.<br/><br/>Students are to work in pairs for the assignment. They will be randomly assigned to work with a different partner for each assignment. An odd number of students may result in a group of 3.<br/><br/>Instructions for the assignments will be posted to Learn on the day that the assignment period begins. Students will generally have five days to complete the assignment (see specific dates above). Late assignments will be penalized 5% per day. Assignments will not be accepted more than 7 days late. Submissions must be made via the Learn dropbox.<br/><br/>During assignment weeks, in-person class time can be used to work on the material though attendance is not mandatory during those times.</p><h3>Research proposal</h3><p>A short research proposal is due at a sufficiently early point in the term to ensure that students are working on their research paper well in advance of the due date. This is because it takes time and effort to familiarize yourself with a data set, to clean the data, and to conduct and refine a theoretically driven, statistically defensible quantative analysis.<br/><br/>The proposal should be a maximum of 2 pages (double spaced). It should include:<br/>-a brief overview of the theoretical backdrop of the paper;<br/>-the research questions/hypotheses driving the analysis;<br/>-a description of the data you plan to analyse;<br/>-a basic (preliminary) overview of the variables/scales that you will include in your analysis;<br/>-an analysis plan (outline the expected bivariate and multivariate analyses).<br/><br/>I understand that things can change between the time you submit your proposal and the time you submit your final paper. That’s fine. As long as you’re working on it early enough, the proposal will have served its purpose of trying to get students to work out details and develop a plan as early as possible.<br/><br/>The proposal will be marked holistically. As in, I will not be providing a specific mark breakdown. Instead, I will be looking for evidence that an effort has been made to think through how the analysis will flow, what it will test, and how it will be executed. A well thought through plan to test a theoretically driven and clearly articulated research question/hypothesis will warrant a high grade.<br/><br/>** You must submit this via the Learn drop box by 11:59 pm on the due date. There is a 2-day grace period on this deadline. It is considered an extension that anyone can use without having to provide notification or documentation. However, you should do your best to submit by the posted deadline as no extensions will be granted beyond the 2-day grace period. At that point, a late penalty of 5% per day will be applied.</p><h3>Research paper</h3><p>Students are expected to produce an 12-15 page research paper on a topic of their choice (text only; title page, abstract, tables, references, and appendices are not counted towards this limit). See expanded instructions posted on Learn for more details.</p><p>Students are expected to find an appropriate data set to use to address their particular research question. Many can be found on the website for the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research – ICPSR - <i><strong>https://www.icpsr.umich.edu</strong></i>.</p><p>The research papers are to take the form of a publishable journal article.</p><p>Useful resources for finding data:</p><p>-https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/dataverse/open – Publicly available versions of Statistics Canada data can be found here (e.g., General Social Survey; Canadian Tobacco and Nicotine Survey; Canadian Labour Force Survey)</p><p>-www.openicpsr.org – This is an open access data repository for researchers to post their data.</p><p>-https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch – this is a Google search engine for data.</p><p>Generally speaking, data that you can access publicly is acceptable (and does not require ethics clearance). Do not use data if you suspect that it has been collected or posted illegally or unethically or if you think that it does not meet scientific standards of rigour. Consult with me if you have any questions.</p><p>** You must submit this via the Learn drop box by 11:59 pm on the due date. There is a 2-day grace period on this deadline.

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h2>
  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>Clarification of the boilerplate:</p><p>I may record the lectures by filming the front of the room to allow students to re-watch the lectures. Students have found this helpful in the past. The camera will be positioned so that it doesn't show any students. If that is not possible, affected students will be notified and can choose to move seats.

  Administrative Policy

<div>
<h3>Communication</h3><p>For questions related to how the course is administered, please use the ‘Course admin Q&amp;A’ discussion forum on Learn. These include questions on assignment expectations, course structure, etc.<br/><br/>For questions related to the topics we deal with in this course, please attend office hours. If you can’t, please use the ‘Course material Q&amp;A’ discussion forum on Learn. <br/><br/>For personal issues, please use email.<br/><br/>The reason this communication strategy is being employed is because I think there is value in allowing others to see both the questions that others are asking and the responses to those questions.<br/><br/>I will aim to respond to emails and discussion posts by the end of the next work day (generally within 24 hours). I try to avoid emails in the evening and on weekends.</p><h3>Continuity of Education Plan</h3><p>Should in-person activities on campus be interrupted over the course of the term for any duration, lecture videos will be posted on Learn and students will be expected to use the remote desktop version of the software (or purchase their own license) since computer labs will not be available. The schedule will be unchanged (lecture, assignment, paper due dates will continue as outlined in the syllabus). <br/><br/>Students who need to self-isolate should use the lecture videos to continue course progress.<br/><br/>All assignments (including the proposal and research paper) can be completed remotely. </p><h2>Software</h2><p>The statistics package Stata is used heavily in this course. There is a very good reason that I am choosing to teach using Stata despite the fact that many students have previous exposure to SPSS. It is quite simply the best stats package available (in my opinion). It can do more than SPSS and is easier to use than SAS, R, or Python. I suggest you embrace Stata. The learning curve is about the same as SPSS but it will allow you much greater sophistication in your analyses.<br/><br/>It is available in the PAS computer labs (PAS 1237, 1080, 1098). The Arts Computing Office (ACO) has also enabled it to be remotely accessed from any location for free. A separate document is posted on Learn to help you get it set up. If you run into any difficulties accessing Stata, please first go through the material on Learn and consult with the online guidance posted by the ACO (https://uwaterloo.ca/arts-computing/). If that doesn’t solve the problem, they can be contacted at acohelp@uwaterloo.ca.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if you want a copy of Stata on your own computer, you can get a six month rental for $48 US (Stata/BE – generally a good choice, but limited to ~2000 variables; if you think you will be working with data sets with more variables than that, consider Stata/SE). If you foresee the need to conduct quantitative analyses in your future, a perpetual license might be worth it. To purchase and download Stata, go to this address and follow the links: https://www.stata.com/order/dl/<br/> </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course <i><strong>with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement</strong></i>. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will be discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations"><u>accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</u></a> under the<u> </u>Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i><u>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</u></i></a>.
