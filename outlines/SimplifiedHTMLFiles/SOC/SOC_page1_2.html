<p>By the end of the course, you will be able to distinguish sociology as an academic discipline. You will be able to describe and explain the theoretical and methodological tools sociologists use to examine the social world. We will apply the tricks of the sociological trade – sociological theories, concepts, and methods – to challenge conventional wisdom.</p>

<h3><strong>Quizzes</strong></h3><p>Quizzes are ‘open’ allowing students to potentially complete them in advance; however, each week’s quiz will close on Friday at 11:59 PM of that week. Please see the due dates specified in the Course Schedule.</p><h3><strong>Late Assignments</strong></h3><p>Assignments are ‘open’, allowing students to potentially complete them in advance. </p><p>Any assignments submitted to the dropbox after the deadline specified in the Course Schedule will be considered late. (Assignment submissions are time-stamped, so there are no inaccuracies.)</p><p>To avoid late penalties, students wishing to apply Grace Days to the assignments should indicate the number of grace days on the cover page of the assignment (see "Grace Days Policy" below). </p><p>Once the grace days are used up, assignments will be considered late. Late assignments will result in a penalty of 5% for each 24-hour period.</p><h3><strong>Grace Days Policy</strong></h3><p>Each student has a total 3 ‘Grace Days’ they can apply to the assignments. This will allow students to push back an assignment deadline without penalty. Students can apply these 3 days any way they wish (e.g., using 1 Grace Day for Assignment 1 and 2 Grace Days for Assignment 2; using 0 grace days for Assignment 1 and 3 grace days for Assignment 2). </p><p>To avoid late penalties, students wishing to apply their grace days to an an assignment should indicate the number of grace days on the title page of the assignment. </p><p>Once the Grace Days are passed or used up, assignments will be considered late. Late assignments will result in a penalty of 5% for each 24-hour period</p><p><strong>*Please note that confusion over submitting to the dropbox is </strong><i><strong>not</strong></i><strong> a valid reason for a late assignment.</strong></p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous"><u>Office of Indigenous Relations</u></a>.</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
