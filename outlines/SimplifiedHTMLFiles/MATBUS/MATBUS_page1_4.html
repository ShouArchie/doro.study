<p><strong>Assignments</strong></p><p>All assignments are to be completed individually. However you are encourage to use the Piazza form to ask your classmates questions and provide hints to other students. The 4 assignments will be distributed through the Crowdmark mailer. You will need to upload your solutions to Crowdmark. </p><p><strong>Term Tests</strong></p><p>The 2 term tests will be held in-person during class time, see the schedule. The tests will be closed book, however you may bring your own 11x8.5 two-sided cheat sheet. </p><p>In the event that public health requires us to be online, then the tests continue to be held during the class time. We will then use the Crowdmark mailer to distribute the test. There will not be a 24-hour window, the test must be completed during the scheduled class time. The expectation is that all students will be in Waterloo during the fall term. No alternative arrangements will be made for students in other location and time zones.</p><p><strong>Regrading</strong></p><p>You have 7 days from the time the assignment/midterm is handed back to you to appeal a midterm or an assignment. (e.g., If you get an assignment back on a Tuesday, I will take appeals until and including the following Tuesday). </p><p>Please send an email to the me. The email must contain your name, student id, Waterloo email address and a link to your Crowdmark assignment.</p><p>Give a clear explanation as to why you think you deserve a different mark. It is helpful if the subject line of the email is “MATBUS 470: regrade request A#” where # is the number of the assignment. Note: You can gain or lose marks on assignments. Students are frequently surprised that losing marks is not that uncommon.</p><p><strong>Final Exam</strong></p><p>There will be a 2.5 hour final exam, which will be scheduled by the registrar's office. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/exam-schedule">https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/exam-schedule</a></p><p>Again the expectation is that student will be in Waterloo during the exam period. No alternatives arrangements will be made for students in other locations, time zones or for those choosing to travel during the exam period.</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
