<div>ANTH 312 / RS 312 / SI 312:</div>
<p>This course examines the religion, cultures, and politics associated with Islamic civilization in the modern world, focusing on the everyday lives and practices of ordinary Muslims. Through anthropological approaches based on ethnographic fieldwork in a variety of geographical areas, students study topics such as ritual, language, gender, authority, representation, stereotypes, fundamentalism, and secularism. Students will develop greater understanding of religious diversity by studying insider and outsider perspectives on Muslim lives and practices worldwide. Students will improve their critical thinking, writing, and oral communication skills to engage academic and public debates about Islam.</p>

<p>In an era where Islam and Muslims are frequently subjects of media sensationalism, political rhetoric, and public policy debates, this comprehensive course aims to equip students with a more sophisticated understanding of Muslim lives and practices. To achieve this goal, we adopt an anthropological approach that focuses on field research, ethnographic storytelling, and contemporary case studies across the globe. After a brief overview of what constitutes an anthropological approach to the study of religion (and particularly Islam), we will consider various aspects of Muslim life. These include religious and cultural rituals, social worlds, and political lives of Muslims in a variety of geographical areas from Asia to North America. It is important to state at the outset that this course does not focus on the theology of Islam. Our approach is not textual but ethnographic. This means that we are not interested as much in the different juridical interpretations of Islam as a religion, but in <i>the diversity of the ways in which Muslims construct their religious, political, and cultural identities in practice</i>. Selected case studies raise issues concerning Islam in modern times such as ritual, language, gender, authority, representation, stereotypes, race, and secularism. We will conclude the course with an ethnographic study of Muslim youth in North America. </p>

<h3>Participation (10%) and Attendance* (5%)</h3><p>Each class will combine lecture and discussion elements. Many will include interactive student activities (discussions, in-class writing activities, etc.) as well. None of these elements work unless you attend regularly and read the assigned materials. Please come to class ready to analyze and respond to the assigned readings, as well as to the contributions of your fellow students. Your active engagement in all of these exercises is essential. Please note that engagement includes attentive listening as much as speaking. Evaluation of participation will be based on the quality of what you contribute. <strong>Contributions to the discussion might involve introducing a topic, examining assumptions, assessing the source and reliability of information and formulating new questions. They might also include statements of where you are confused or questions about the meaning of core concepts; questions about what the author is trying to communicate. </strong>Arriving late or departing early will affect your participation grade if they happen recurrently.</p><p>At some point during each lecture, expect to be asked to write down your response to a content-related question in relation to the assigned reading for that lecture. The question may be in the fill-in-the blank or multiple-choice format and will most likely be a general question the theme or topic of the assigned chapter/article. This is to make sure that you do the readings before class time. Your overall performance in these exercises will count towards your participation mark.</p><p>*Students taking this course under ANTH 489 will only be graded for participation at 10%. Even if they attend all classes, if they don't participate in the ways described above, their attendance will not amount to any grades for this course.</p><h3>Presentation (10%)</h3><p>To ensure focused discussions of the weekly readings, and to allow students to develop their presentation skills, students will be asked to make <strong>one</strong> class presentation, either individually or in groups of 2. I can allow for a group of 3 students only under exceptional circumstances. You should prepare to take charge of the class for a 15-20 minute period in order to present key themes and raise questions that emerge from that week’s readings, to be followed by discussion. <br/>Think about the following as you prepare your presentation:</p><p>1. What is the author trying to convey to his/her audience in this chapter?</p><p>2. What are the strengths of the argument or examples he or she is presenting?</p><p>3. For journal articles: How do the arguments relate to or compare with the view of other authors you have read in the course or elsewhere?</p><p>4. What is confusing or unsatisfying about the reading?</p><p>5. Pose 2-3 discussion questions for the class to consider.</p><p>6. You may also introduce some relevant additional material you want us to consider in light of the reading. These could be from your own travel experiences; from popular culture, including print materials (e.g. political or entertainment magazines, newspapers), music, film clips, video selections of news or television programming, social media, etc (e.g. a newspaper article, item in the news, policy, etc.). </p><h3>Online Weekly Posts** (15% [20% for ANTH 489])</h3><p><strong>3% per post, 5 in total</strong>  [7 for ANTH 489] from week 1 until the end of week 10 (excluding), to be submitted by 2pm on the day of the second class for the week for which the readings are assigned</p><p>This course requires each student to submit a total of 5 weekly discussion posts to Learn on the assigned reading(s) of the week before the start of the Thursday class. You can choose for which weeks (of 9 in total, excluding the reading week —week 7) you wish to discuss the assigned reading(s) in your response, but you are required to submit 5 of these throughout the term until week 11 (which is the week, we begin reading the ethnography Muslim Cool). The discussion posts can be considered as the very early stages of a response paper. They do not need to be longer than a couple of paragraphs and ideally should engage all the readings assigned for that week. You are encouraged to formulate one or two discussion questions that relate to your discussion in the post.</p><p>They can be in the form of a discussion question for the others to consider, a critique or comment of the readings’ content, or simply a question about a part of the reading that remains unclear to you. If you aim for an A or an A+, you should use the space to discuss how that reading connects to or diverges from the other readings (from the same week or an earlier week) that approach to the same issue. </p><p>These should be thoughtful discussion points and questions not simply emotional/personal reactions to the reading. The objective of the assignment is to improve your skills in formulating good analytic ideas and questions. Therefore, the discussion posts will be evaluated on quality and the originality of your engagement with the text, and not simply completion</p><p>I will try to go over at least some of the comments or questions in class time, but feel free to respond to others’ comments online. Even though these online responses won’t count the same as in-class participation, I will consider them while marking your overall participation. I recommend that those of you who may not feel as comfortable as others to speak in public make use of this option. The discussion posts (just like the response papers-see below) will be evaluated on quality and the originality of your engagement with the text, and not simply completion.</p><p><strong>**Please note that students taking this course under 489 are expected to complete 7 discussion posts rather than 5 and engage readings recommended for ANTH/SI/RS 312 [that are required for them] in their posts! </strong></p><h3>Movie or Controversy Analysis (25%)  </h3><p>Students are asked to choose one of the two options mentioned below to write a short paper.</p><p><i><strong>Option 1</strong></i><br/>Write a short paper on a public controversy about Islam in a context of your own choice. Analyze the debate in light of the course readings, lectures, and class discussions. Use at least two course readings in your analysis.</p><p><i><strong>Option 2</strong></i></p><p>Reflect on one or two of the films that we have viewed in the course to date. </p><p>In your essay, be sure to refer to <strong>at least two themes/readings </strong>addressed in at least two relevant course readings that you will cite.</p><p>The detailed guidelines will be provided later in the term. The papers MUST be submitted to Dropbox by the deadline. The paper is to be approximately 1000 words which is not more than 4 double spaced pages (12 Font, Times New Roman, one inch margins on all sides). They must be carefully written reflections and not first drafts or simple stream of consciousness essays. They should use the Chicago Manual of Style author-date citation available at <a href="https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html">https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html</a>. The content and structure of the argument as well as the writing (spelling, grammar, organization, etc.) will be graded. Best papers are those with a clear argument. Guidelines are available at Learn</p><h3>Book Review (35%) (approximately 6 PAGES <u>12 Font, Times New Roman, one inch margins on all sides)</u>: </h3><p>The goal of this assignment is to explore in more detail a topic that interests you in the anthropology of Islam, that is addressed in the ethnography <i>Muslim Cool. </i>The review is meant to develop your skills of applying the conceptual tools you learned in this class to a more in-depth case-study. <strong>Please note this review is not merely a summary of the content of the book</strong>, but it is a reflection of what are, in your view, the strengths and weaknesses of the book; how it relates to other material you have read in this course; how ‘well’ is written and how poignant are the anthropological themes in Islam that it presents. Focusing on one theme that speaks to a topic addressed in other course readings (rather than trying to evaluate the entirety of the book) would help you maintain coherence.</p><h3>Late Work </h3><p><i><strong>Online discussion posts:</strong></i><strong> </strong>For fairness and the overall purpose of response papers, <strong>it is not possible to submit a response paper after the class on the assigned readings for that week is over.</strong> Please note that you are not required to submit a response paper each week, in fact you need to submit one only for one week. To avoid losing marks on this assignment, make good use of this flexibility to choose the weeks that fit your schedule and allow you to submit your response papers on time. </p><p><i><strong>Other essays: </strong></i>If you turn your short paper or final essay in late, your mark will be downgraded by 3% per day (including weekends). Feedback may not be provided on late papers. </p>

<h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory">CAUT Guide to Acknowledging Traditional Territory</a>.</p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p><h4>Held-with courses</h4><p>Please note that a held-with course will only count in the average for the subject code under which it has been taken, unless it is cross-listed with the subject code of its’ held-with course. For example, if a CLAS/HIST held-with course is taken under the CLAS subject code then it will count only in the CLAS major average, not the HIST major average. A held-with course will also only count towards program and breadth requirements of the subject code under which it is taken, unless it is cross-listed with the subject code of its’ held-with course.</p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. </p><p>Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information">Quest</a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system. The faculty and staff in Arts encourage students to seek out mental health support if they are needed.</p><p><strong>On campus supports</strong></p><p>For counselling (individual or group) reach out to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Campus Wellness and Counselling Services.</a> Counselling Services strives to provide a secure, supportive environment for students of all orientations and backgrounds.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates.
