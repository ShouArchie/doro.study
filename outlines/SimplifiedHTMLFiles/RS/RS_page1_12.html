  Course Description

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>JS 236 / RS 236:</div>
<p>The career and thought of the apostle Paul, at once a Jew, a Graeco-Roman, and a Christ believer, living within the Roman Empire. Attention is given to issues such as spirit, Jewish Law, grace, freedom and slavery, Christ, church, politics, gender, and sexuality.</p>

<p>There are several major components of the course. First, the course will deal with some background material on the formation of biblical documents. This will help you, whether or not you have had an introductory course in New Testament in the past, to get on board with the assumptions behind many of the questions raised and conclusions drawn in the course of study. Second, we will then deal with the nature of the sources for Paul's life and thought, and, third, glean from those sources what information we can about Paul and his life. The fourth component is really a number of in-depth studies of the letters that bear his name. That will make up the bulk of the course. In the process you will learn to see them as real correspondence from the very first decades of what became Christianity, reflecting the dynamics of life in the ancient Greco-Roman Mediterranean world. Paul's ideas will be discussed within the context of his letters, rather than as a systematic body of thought or theology. It will become quite apparent why that is important. At the conclusion of the course, I will briefly address two of the most popularly contentious issues in relation to Paul, namely, his views on homosexuality and the status of women. In particular, the issue of the status and role of women will give you an excellent opportunity to test your learnings, to try out your skills as biblical scholars and interpreters.</p>

  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>The learning outcomes of this course are as follows:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The first and most important objective of this course is, obviously, to learn about the important figure of antiquity who continues to have an enormous impact on our present time—Paul the Apostle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The second objective is to learn to read and analyze the relevant New Testament documents as historical sources of information both on Paul's life and his thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The third objective is to pay particular attention to what it meant for Paul as a Jew to have a mission to non-Jews, and what effect that had on his thought, his hopes, and also his troubled relationship with fellow Jews.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The fourth objective is to keep in mind throughout what it meant for Paul to work, preach, teach, and form communities within the context of Roman imperial reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The fifth objective is a bit fuzzy, since it is one you yourself will shape in a wide variety of ways, given that you as students have very different kinds of religious investment (or perhaps none at all) in this subject matter. I very much hope that this study will nudge you to "go deep" in wrestling with the implications of Paul's thought—whatever that might mean for you personally.</td>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
</p>
<div>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Late Written Assignments</h3><p>There are sometimes exceptional circumstances in which students are unable to get their written assignments in by the due date (illness, emergencies, etc.). If you anticipate a problem, please contact the instructor as soon as possible. If no arrangements have been made, a late penalty of 5% per day will normally be applied up to a maximum of 15%. The late penalty for papers submitted more than 10 days late, and for which no extension or arrangements have been made, will be determined by the instructor, but will be no less than 20%. No assignments will be accepted after two weeks late except with prior permission from the instructor.</p><h3>Late Discussion Postings</h3><p><strong>Both the initial post and the follow up post must be posted by one week from the due date to receive partial credit.</strong> Partial credit will be given for late postings up to one week past the due date. Late postings will receive a 50% deduction (3.5% becomes 1.75%, and 1.5% becomes 0.75%). This does not include any deductions for quality.</p><h3>Plagiarism</h3><p>The very nature of the assignments makes plagiarism less of a temptation than it otherwise might be. As you know, there is hardly a more serious academic sin. University of Waterloo's policy is clear. Plagiarism is</p><blockquote><p><i>The act of presenting the ideas or words of another as one's own. The use of other people's ideas or words must be properly acknowledged and referenced. This applies to all written materials such as essays, laboratory reports, work term reports, design projects, statistical data, computer programs and research results. The properly acknowledged use of sources is an accepted and important part of scholarship. Use of such material without acknowledgement, however, is contrary to accepted norms of academic behaviour</i>.</p></blockquote><p>If plagiarism is discovered it will lead to a failing grade in the course and possible further disciplinary action by the university. I am obligated to make this clear to you, and to report infractions to the Associate Dean of Arts, Undergraduate Affairs.</p><h4>Generative Artificial Intelligence</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as critical thinking and analysis, developing and practicing writing skills and the ability to synthesize and incorporate information from biblical texts. Therefore, the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).   </p><p> You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.  </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee's page on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">Generative artificial intelligence</a>.</p><p> Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:  </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources">Student Success Office</a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students">Writing and Communication Centre</a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students">AccessAbility Services</a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide">Library</a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p>Using AI tools, ChatGPT, or similar tools that generate text, code, or visual images for content generation and submitting it as one’s own original work is a violation of the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">University of Waterloo’s Policy 71 (Student Discipline)</a>.</p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>With gratitude, we acknowledge that Renison University College is located on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg, Hodinohsyó:ni, and Attawandaran (Neutral) Peoples, which is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes ten kilometres on each side of the Grand River from mouth to source. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place in all corners of our campus through research, learning, teaching, community building and outreach. We are guided by the work of our Reconciliation and Re-storying Steering Committee and Anti-Racism and Decolonization Spokescouncil, as well as the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">University of Waterloo’s Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>
