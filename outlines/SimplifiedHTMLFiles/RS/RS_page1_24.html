  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1. understand martyrdom as a communal and discursive practice of framing the meaning of past acts of violence in light of religious beliefs and present concerns;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. understand the diversity of religious approaches to “dying for God,” especially in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and some ethical implications of how such stories are told;</td>

</tr>
</tbody>

</div>
<div>
<h4>Course format and class culture</h4><p>In the course, we will make the most of the fact that we will be together in person and are a relatively small group. I will have a short lecture most days but I expect that the majority of our time will be in small group and large group discussions. In particular, we will often work through primary texts in class. We will create a learning community together as we get to know each other better throughout the term. In order for this to be realized, please come to every class. I will use LEARN to post links to readings, information about activities and assignments, occasional summaries of what we did in class, etc. However, LEARN is in no way a substitute for coming to class every time.</p><p><i>I do not permit the use of Generative AI to produce text for any assignments in this course. See the policy below for further rationale and details.</i></p><p>This course necessarily entails discussion of violence, including torture and sexual violence. I will work to create a supportive and respectful environment for these discussions, an expectation that extends to everyone in the class, mindful that some topics may be triggering. If you have concerns about any class content, please communicate these with me. I will seek to accommodate as best I can.</p><p><i>Please consider others: Do not come and go during the class period unless absolutely necessary. Use devices for taking notes but not for activities unrelated to the course.</i></p>

<p> </p><h4>1. Attendance/engagement (10%)</h4><p>Key learning in this course will happen during the scheduled class meetings. You are expected to attend all classes, complete all required readings on time, bring questions or comments on the reading, take notes during lectures, and engage in informed, critical, balanced (in the sense of not speaking too little or too much) and sensitive ways with others. Come to every class prepared to discuss in small groups and contribute to all-class discussions. </p><p>Please see the section below regarding “Declaring Absences.” If there are other compelling reasons why cannot be present on a given day, please let me know. For each class missed beyond two, there will be a deduction of one mark (out of 10).</p><p> </p><h4>2. Brief report on Bonhoeffer play or alternate assignment (8%)</h4><p>a. Preferred option: Attend the play <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/grebel/events/bonhoeffer-cell-92">Bonhoeffer: Cell 22</a> on January 10 or 11 at Grebel. It is free for members of the class. Write a short (500-600 word) report on the play, and particularly the portrayal of Bonhoeffer as a (potential) martyr. Identify critical issues that are raised by the play. (You may find a helpful <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/dietrich-bonhoeffer">backgrounder on Bonhoeffer here</a>.)</p><p>b. Alternate option: Write a short (500-600 word) report on a film relating to martyrdom. Pay attention to the portrayal of martyrdom and identify critical issues that are raised by the film. A list of possible options will be provided. However, it cannot be <i>Romero</i> (1989).</p><p><strong>Due January 16 (11:59 pm).</strong></p><p> </p><h4>3. Analyses of representations of martyrdom (2 x 15% = 30%)</h4><p>Write a short essay in which you critically analyze a written (first assignment) or cinematic (second assignment) portrayal of a martyr. Length: 1000-1200 words.</p><p>a. Analyze the ancient text <i>The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity</i>. (Just the text itself, which begins at the middle of p. 388, not the introduction by Tilley though you may draw on Tilley as you would any other secondary source.) The text is available through <a href="https://www.reserves.uwaterloo.ca/ares/ares.dll/plink?156AD764">course reserves here</a>. <strong>Due January 30 (11:59 pm).</strong></p><p>b. Analyze the film <i>Romero</i> (1989) which will be shown in class. It is also <a href="https://youtu.be/EaQWd0uBaHs?si=rkmSJqoCPcQUlA68">available here</a>. <strong>Due February 13 (11:59 pm).</strong></p><p>An analysis is an examination of the parts or elements, but can also consider the effect of the whole. Consider especially the strategies by which the author or filmmaker communicates particular messages to their audience. What are the messages that the author or filmmaker intends to communicate, and how are they communicated? What religious/political/social agendas are being advanced, or denounced, and how? (Some of the “how” may be quite “big picture,” but you should also consider the function of very particular phrases, rhetorical devices, cinematic techniques, etc. Stay close to the text/film and don’t veer off in a direction that is merely loosely inspired by something in the text/film.) You may also want to draw conclusions about the intended audience of the text/film based on specific features. </p><p>You can assume that your reader has read the text or seen the movie and so you don’t need to summarize. You do not need to do additional research for these assignments, but you are encouraged to draw on critical tools from lectures (consider these to “common knowledge” in the course, and so you don’t need to cite unless you are making use of a direct quotation), discussions, and readings (use Chicago Style to cite). When citing the <i>Passion</i>, use the short form of the title (no author) and refer to the section numbers (e.g. VI.9) not page numbers.  You do not need to include full publication details.</p><p>Compose a very brief introduction that gets right into the substance, articulate a very general thesis, and end with conclusion that brings a sense of closure without summarizing what you have already written.  </p><p>A text/film analysis is not primarily about your personal opinion, or whether you “liked” the text/film. With that in mind, you can consider your own reaction as relevant data. If you were captivated, inspired, or repulsed by something, investigate further how such effects were achieved.</p><p> </p><h4>4. Class journal reflections – 8 entries (20%) </h4><p>This assignment is in lieu of a mid-term test. It is designed to promote critical engagement with required readings and class lectures and discussions and foster critical reflection on your learning experience.</p><p>The basic “unit” of this assignment is one journal entry/reflection on one class (i.e. a single class meeting), which includes both the required reading for the class, and lecture/discussion in class. You must complete a journal entry for 8 classes – and I strongly encourage you to write this on the day of the class, or a day or two later. Do not attempt to do all of these reflections just before they are due. You may want to aim to write one per week. Each entry should have a heading of the date of the class in question, and then be followed by about 250-300 words. (An entry can be longer, but writing a longer entry doesn’t reduce the length of future entries.)</p><p>You do not need to summarize what you read or did in class but it should be evident that you did the reading and were present in class. Be sure you are reflecting on the specifics of the readings/class, and not just something very loosely inspired by one comment someone made.</p><p>I may ask you to discuss in small groups what you have been writing about, or what you plan to write about, but you will not need to share anything specific if you don’t want to.</p><p>The journals will be assessed in terms of the quality of critical reflection and how they engage with course material.</p><p>Some possible prompts:</p><ul><li>Reflect on what you are learning; what is new to you, surprising, disappointing, etc. Identify one key learning or “take-away.”</li><li>Use writing to “think through” you own position or opinion on a particular topic.</li><li>If you disagree with something the instructor or a student, reflect on their perspective, and your own.</li><li>If you wish you had said something in class, but didn’t get a chance or couldn’t formulate your opinion at the time, report on that now.</li><li>Respond to anything we are engaging. You could draw on rational arguments, emotional responses, or anything else.</li><li>Reflect on how anything in this course relates to other courses you have taken or are taking.</li><li>Reflect on the process of learning – what kind of activities work well for you, and why? What kinds of activities are as helpful for fostering learning, and why?</li><li>You may also reflect on a class by writing a poem or song, drawing a picture, or some other creative mode of response. (You may need to add a brief explanation to such a submission.)</li><li>In general, mix up the kinds of journal entries that you write, for example by engaging with different kinds of prompts in different entries.</li></ul><p>Because you will be writing a separate analysis on the film Romero, the classes in which the movie is shown and discussed cannot be used for journal entries.</p><p><strong>Due March 13 (11:59 pm)</strong></p><p> </p><h4>5. Final project (32%)</h4><p>Research and write a paper on a martyr, group of martyrs, or a theme related to the course. Further details will be provided in a separate document. (25%)</p><p>In addition, present to the class a summary of your work using a paper handout or a few basic slides. The presentation should be about 7-8 minutes, followed by a time for questions and discussion. (7%)</p><p>Presentations will be scheduled on the last three classes of the term. <strong>Research paper is due April 9 (11:59 pm).</strong></p><p> </p><h3>Notes about all assignments:</h3><ul><li><i><strong>Read the instructions carefully and follow them diligently.</strong></i></li><li>Submit all assignments online, through the “Dropbox” in LEARN.</li><li>Use PDF or MS Word formats, and not a link to a Google Doc.</li><li>I will return assignments through the Dropbox, with comments added directly to the paper itself. (If you do not see comments on returned work, contact the instructor.) <i>You are expected to read instructor feedback and incorporate it in future work.</i></li><li>Observe carefully the instructions about length of papers. Use a standard 12-point font, double spacing, and standard margins. <i>Include your word count at the end of the paper.</i></li><li>Be sure to give each paper a title.</li><li>For the final research paper you are strongly encouraged to use Chicago Style (Turabian), footnote/bibliography and resources will be provided to support this. If you use another style, such as APA or MLA, indicate to me which style you are using and be consistent throughout.</li><li><i>Regardless of style, you MUST include a page number when using a direct quotation</i>.</li><li>Use inclusive language (e.g. humankind rather than mankind) when referring to people. Avoid use of language that perpetuates stereotypes.</li><li>Add page numbers.</li><li>Proofread your papers.</li></ul><h4>Late submission </h4><ul><li>Plan ahead, make note of due dates, and consider tests and assignments in other courses.</li><li>Each student may claim three (3) days of grace, which are essentially free extensions, for which no rationale needs to be given. These can only be used for written assignments, not the scheduled class presentation.</li><li>How to claim them: You must <i>send an email to the instructor before the deadline of the assignment in question</i>. In that email, indicate which assignment you are referring to, and how many days (1, 2, or 3) you are claiming. You may divide your three days over two or three assignments, or use them all for one assignment.</li><li>If you are not using grace days, and have not worked out an extension in advance (typically with supporting documentation), late assignments will be penalized 3% (of the value of that assignment) per calendar day.</li></ul><p> </p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as critical analysis and effective written communication. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
