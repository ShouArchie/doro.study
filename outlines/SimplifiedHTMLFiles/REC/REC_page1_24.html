<h2><strong>Q: Sounds great. So, what exactly are we learning?</strong></h2><p>A: The ILOs and course vision, described above, create a framework for deepening our understanding of the following:</p><p><strong>(TR) Philosophy - (TR) Practice &amp; Application - (TR) Theory/Frameworks - (TR) Research/Knowledge Building &amp; Sharing - Personal (TR) Practitioner Philosophy </strong></p><p>Practice, frameworks, theory, and research are not so simply teased apart. In each of our meetings and in your individual reflection, if you look closely, you will see how many of these aspects of knowing, feeling, and doing TR occur simultaneously. My hope is that you have the opportunity to experience this complexity and see how each comes together to shape your unique understanding and practice of TR. In short, we will 1) think critically about what you’ve learned about TR so far, 2) (re)learn TR through philosophy, and 3) (re-)construct your landscape of TR by developing a personal TR philosophy statement.</p><p><strong>Principles that Guide our Teaching Philosophy for REC 455</strong></p><p>Teaching and learning is an art and a science and it requires deep listening, dialogue, and the active engagement of teacher-learners in relationship. Education and learning is a lifelong process, and the conversations we begin in REC 455 are a continuation of conversations you started in other courses in your undergraduate degree and the beginning of some new ones as you launch into your careers.</p><p>Excerpt from Arai, Berbary, and Dupuis (2015):</p><p>We have to be ready to engage in all of these conversations and engage practice to critically explore the intertwined implications and possibilities of recreation and leisure in all of its complexities. The field must encourage fluidity and multiplicity in our approaches and practices so that TR remains historically and culturally relevant for those who engage its transformative powers. This requires that we break out of the silos we have created dividing us into groups of practitioners, educators, and researchers – we must each be all three and this calls all of us to:</p><ol><li><strong>Embrace diversity and difference </strong>–understanding there are multiple versions of the world and different perspectives open up our view to things we may not have seen before.</li><li><strong>Challenge education </strong>– rather than accepting a banking approach to education we must deeply explore and understand multiple theories and ways of learning/knowing and how each works when put into practice, including what becomes possible and what gets denied.</li><li><strong>Embrace ambiguity </strong>– letting go of rigid thinking that moves us on a quest for the one right answer, the best practice that will work in every situation. This also calls for us to give up a quest for control and the sorting of things into categories in which ideas and people are seen as bounded and separate.</li><li><strong>Engage in compassionate critique</strong>– as we reflect on our own ideas and practices and those of others there is a need to stay open to contextual and historical understanding, holding in mind the intention to serve that has fueled other theories and paradigms.</li><li><strong>Approach practice with humility</strong>– connected to the idea of there being no right answer, no one is all knowing or able to predict, protect others, or pronounce outcomes.</li><li><strong>Embrace vulnerability </strong>– being experience-near in practice requires that we come closer to the experiences of others and also our own. This also calls for us to become more comfortable with, and able to hold, emotion and not-knowing and to see these as strengths and opportunities for something new and unpredicted to emerge.</li><li><strong>Look into the paradox– </strong>when reflecting on theory, language, practices, and actions in therapeutic recreation consider not only what it does, but also what it protects us from seeing or knowing. It is in this practice that we are more likely to see the unintended harms of TR. When we engage in reflective practice it is important for us to recognize not only where we are already situated and what we see, think, feel, and do but also aspects of the same that go unrecognized.</li></ol><p>In short, we need to engage multiple theories in practice and therapeutic recreation should now, and forever, be up for grabs and critically troubled (pp. 317-318).</p><p> </p>

Person Profile (2%) I </strong>The Personal Profile form can be found on LEARN and asks you questions about yourself and your experiences. Completion of your Personal Profile will help us get to know each other and provide useful information on how to make this course the most beneficial for you. There are no right or wrong answers on this inventory, they are simply used to help maximize your learning experience. All responses will be kept confidential and will only be read by the teaching staff on this course. The Personal Profile is due to the corresponding LEARN Dropbox by <strong>Monday, January 13, 2025, by 11:59pm.</strong></p><p><strong>2. Shared Leadership in Learning (20%) | </strong>Creating a learning environment involves the active engagement of each person in REC 455. We can come to understand diversity and difference and collectively create new knowledge by hearing different voices and perspectives in the classroom. Consequently, a portion of your grade will be assigned to your weekly participation in our weekly seminars. Each member of REC 455 is responsible for attending lecture, their weekly seminar and to contribute to the discussions and activities being facilitated. The reflection papers will be based on your engagement in the seminar unless otherwise stated. See LEARN for more details.</p><p><strong>3. Seminar Facilitation (25%) | </strong>As a group of two (or three) you will lead a seminar discussion about the assigned readings for your assigned week. Your goal is to promote dialogue of the readings among your fellow students. The purpose of your seminar facilitation is to guide an exploration of the readings; it is not to summarize the articles, but rather to encourage a better understanding of the core ideas presented in the readings through group discussion. How participants will be engaged is up to the facilitators to decide. Examples of participation include guided discussions, games, role playing, case studies, etc. The time presenters have to facilitate discussion/participation is limited to 40 minutes each.</p><p>You are responsible for the following:</p><ul><li>A 2-3-page written summary of main ideas and concepts that underlie your seminar. Please submit a copy of this summary to LEARN on the day of your seminar facilitation (7%).</li><li>A 40-minute seminar facilitation based on your submitted summary sheet (15%).</li><li>A one-page self/peer evaluation of your seminar (due the Friday after your facilitation) (3%).</li></ul><p><strong>See Seminar Facilitation Package on LEARN for more details.</strong></p><p>Some aspects your facilitation may be evaluated on include:</p><ul><li><strong>Creativity </strong>(originality of ideas, activities, and group involvement)</li><li><strong>Relatedness to reading </strong>(is the reading being related to material covered in lecture to encourage deeper understanding of the topics)</li><li><strong>Ability to include all seminar members </strong>(all people are included, and presenter is able to facilitate participation/discussion)</li><li><strong>Flow </strong>(are the presenters prepared? Is the presentation/facilitation flowing smoothly?)</li><li><strong>Depth of discussion </strong>(is time used well to make important connections?)</li></ul><p><strong>4. Participant Studies (2 x 12% = 24%) | </strong>In this course we seek to grow knowledge from individual and collective experiences of our therapeutic recreation practices. There is a growing belief that if we are to learn from our experiences, reflection is a key in that process. In her text on reflective practice, Wang (2012) notes, “experience teaches nothing to the non-reflective practitioner” (p. 59). To this end, throughout the term you will complete two participant study assignments related to the weekly topics and required readings that have you reflect on your learnings and readings and apply them to a participant (see <i>Preparatory Work </i>document).</p><p><i><strong>Format of the assignment </strong></i><strong>| </strong>You will be asked a series of questions about an assigned participant. Your papers will incorporate your reflections on the readings assigned from the weeks previous and content from seminars and ask you to apply your learning to these participants. Since you are speaking in your own voice in these reflection papers, it is completely appropriate for you to use “I” in your writing. Please use <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html">APA formatting </a>for font, margins, style of headings, citations, and your list of references. This is an opportunity for you to practice writing with purpose and stating your ideas clearly. A strong participant study reflection will demonstrate strong reading comprehension and synthesis of the topic of the weeks included, connections drawn between readings and issues that face folx in TR, and deep reflection on self and society in relation to relevant discussions related to the course.</p><p><i><strong>Due Dates </strong></i>| Participant Study 1 due Tuesday, February 11th at 11:59pm. Participant Study 2 due Tuesday, March 11th at 11:59pm. See LEARN for full assignment details.</p><p><strong>5. TR Practitioner Panel (4%) I </strong>We will invite individuals who work in various TR contexts into the classroom to share their experiences. This is a great opportunity for all of you to ask any questions you may have and listen to the experiences of individuals working in various contexts and/or with different populations in the field.</p><p>Our TR practitioner panel will occur during lecture time on <strong>Tuesday March 25<sup>th</sup> from 11:30 - 12:45pm.</strong></p><p>For this component you are responsible for:</p><ol><li>Submitting two questions to be asked during the TR practitioner panel (due to the corresponding dropbox by <strong>11:59pm on Friday, March 14<sup>th</sup> </strong>(1%)</li><li>Completion of the TR practitioner panel reflection document due <strong>Monday, March 31 at 11:59pm </strong>(3%)</li></ol><p>A document with the bios of each of our guest speakers will be shared on Learn. You can use these bios and information to form your provided questions.</p><p><strong>6. Final ePortfolio Reflection Assignment (25%) | </strong>This is your chance to return to everything you have learned through REC 455 and (re)construct and articulate your personal (TR) practitioner philosophy. The ePortfolio will provide you with a brave space to share what you have learned and provide evidence to demonstrate this. Using PebblePad or Padlet (link in LEARN), you will create a Reflection Portfolio that will articulate your personal philosophy for deep practice in TR. You will be asked to reflect upon concepts such as: My TR Philosophy, My Definition of TR, My Personal Strengths and Resources, My View of the TR Process, Myself as a Strengths-Based Advocate, and My Vision for the future of TR. A sample portfolio will be provided, which will outline the specific tabs and indicate the questions to reflect on and answer (see LEARN for details). Submit link to portfolio to Dropbox by <strong>Wednesday, April 9, 2025, at 11:59pm.</strong></p><p> </p>

Evidence of such circumstances must be provided to the instructor in the form of supporting documentation from an appropriate source e.g. doctor’s certificate, copy of obituary, letter from Counselling Services, etc. Students with acceptable documentation must contact the instructor no later than 48 hours after a due date to make alternative arrangements. In special unforeseeable circumstances where due dates cannot be met, it is the student’s responsibility to provide acceptable written documentation substantiating the reasons for not meeting the deadline (the “Request for Variance from a Course Outline” form may be used for this purpose). When there are exceptional circumstances, there will be no penalty assigned; if no contact is made, a mark of “zero” will be given.</li></ol><h2>Course Supports</h2><h3><i><strong>Student Absences</strong></i></h3><p>It is your responsibility to be aware of the procedures related to absences due to illness or other reasons. The expectations outlined below are being implemented University-wide and apply to all undergraduate courses in Winter 2025. Please review these guidelines and be prepared to follow them should it become necessary for you to do so this term.</p><h3><strong>Absences in Quest</strong></h3><p> <strong>1</strong>.<strong> Religious or creed-related absence</strong></p><p>Undergraduate students can now submit a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#religious">Religious Observance Self-Declaration</a> in Quest. This allows students to register the dates of potential conflict with coursework. As the dates of important religious observances are generally known well in advance, students must consult with their instructors within two weeks of the announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought.</p><p><strong> 2. Short-term absence </strong>(once/term) – Undergraduate students only</p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#short-term-absence">self-declare</a> one<strong> </strong>short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason (no documentation required). A short-term absence covers up to two calendar days during the <i>formal lecture period</i>. Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), and Studio (STU) courses/class components do not qualify for accommodation as a result of a self-declared short-term absence. There is no expectation that a self-declared short-term absence be total; that is, students may elect to participate in any course and complete any course element(s) despite not being required to. It is the student’s responsibility to <strong>contact their instructors within the first 24 hours </strong>after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><p> <strong>3. COVID-19-related absence </strong>(once/term)</p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#covid-19">self-declare</a> an absence of up to 10 days due to COVID-19-related illness. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in online components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to <strong>contact their instructors within the first 48 hours</strong> after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><h3><strong>Absences Requiring Documentation - </strong><a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/admin#/"><strong>Absence Database</strong></a><strong> – </strong>Undergraduate students only</h3><p><strong> 1. Absence due to illness  </strong></p><p>When students are unable to meet academic obligations due to illness, they are required to complete the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances web form</a> (log in required) and upload their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/students/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/verification-of-illness-form-website-fillable-final_0.pdf">Verification of Illness Form</a> (VIF) to the site. The University of Waterloo Verification of Illness Form (VIF) is normally the only medical documentation accepted to support requests for academic consideration. Students should not submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to their instructors, teaching assistants, or advisors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able given their health condition. Once approved, the student and their instructors will receive a confirmation email of the student’s absence. Course instructors will determine how missed course components are accommodated.</p><p><strong> 2. Absence due to extenuating circumstances</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (bereavement, family illness, varsity sports, etc.), students are required to complete the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances web form</a> (log in required) and upload their official documentation (e.g., plane tickets, court documents, police reports, etc.) to the site. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact instructors within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able given their circumstances.</p><h3><i><strong>Co-op Interviews</strong></i></h3><p>Please schedule co-op interviews outside of class time. There are procedures in place to help mitigate <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts">co-op interview conflicts</a>. If you <strong>must</strong> miss a class due to a continuous round interview or other unavoidable conflict, it is your responsibility to connect with a colleague to clarify any missed lecture content. You must contact me <strong>in advance</strong> of the interview with proof of the interview and your Interview Conflict form to arrange a make-up for in-class assignments. I will <strong>not</strong> arrange make-ups after-the-fact. Please note that a co-op interview is <strong>not</strong> an accepted reason for an assignment extension. </p><h3><i><strong>Accessibility Services</strong></i></h3><p>AccessAbility Services collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum.
