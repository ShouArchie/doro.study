  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>REC 253:</div>
<p>This course involves an unpaid practical experience for students in Honours Therapeutic Recreation. The placement supervisor must be approved by the academic supervisor prior to registering for the course. The practicum will require 105 hours interspersed over one academic term (15 weeks).</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>The course will be assessed on a credit/non-credit basis. Successful completion of the course is based on the following:</p><ol><li>Student performance evaluations (midterm and final) completed by the field supervisor. A minimum rating of <i><strong>satisfactory</strong></i> is required for the <strong>final</strong> evaluation.</li><li>Completion of the required 105 hours verified through a signed log of hours.</li><li>Completion of six reflection posts.</li><li>Completion of practicum proposal and final report.</li><li>Submission of the UW Safety Office forms.</li></ol><p>The course will be using a Student-Led Individually-Created Courses (SLICC) teaching model, which will allow you to co-create your learning experience. This will give you the opportunity to identify the learning that has occurred as a result of your placement experience. Along with completing 105 hours, you will create a proposal for your practicum experience, write six reflective posts, and a final report. I hope you have a meaningful experience!</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong><u>Student Absences - Academic Considerations and Accommodations</u></strong>:</p><p>Students have the following options for declaring an absence during the Winter 2025 term:</p><p>In <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">Quest</a>, students can declare <strong>three</strong><i> </i>types of absences:</p><ol><li><strong>Short-term Absence (once/term)</strong> - students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#short-term-absence">self-declare</a> <strong>one </strong>short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason (no documentation required). A short-term absence covers <strong>up to</strong> <strong><u>two</u></strong> calendar days during the <i>formal lecture period</i>. Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), and Studio (STU) courses/class components do not qualify for accommodation as a result of a self-declared short-term absence. There is no expectation that a self-declared short-term absence be total; that is, students may elect to participate in any course and complete any course element(s) despite not being required to. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</li><li><strong>COVID-19-related Absence (once/term)</strong> - students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#covid-19">self-declare</a> an absence of <strong>up to</strong> <strong><u>10 </u></strong>days due to COVID-19-related illness. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in online components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</li><li><strong>Religious or creed-based Absence</strong> - students can now submit a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#religious">Religious Observance Self-Declaration</a> in Quest. This allows students to register the dates of potential conflict with coursework. As the dates of important religious observances are generally known well in advance, students must consult with their instructors <strong>within two weeks</strong> of the announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought.</li></ol><p>Absences Requiring Documentation - University of Waterloo <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/admin#/">Absence Database </a></p><ol><li><strong>Absence due to Illness</strong> - when students are unable to meet academic obligations due to illness, they are required to complete the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances web form</a> (log in required) and upload their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/students/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/verification-of-illness-form-website-fillable-final_0.pdf">Verification of Illness Form</a> (VIF) to the site. The University of Waterloo Verification of Illness Form (VIF) is normally the only medical documentation accepted to support requests for academic consideration. Students should not submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to their instructors, teaching assistants, or advisors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able given their health condition. Once approved, the student and their instructors will receive a confirmation email of the student’s absence. Course instructors will determine how missed course components are accommodated.</li><li><strong>Absence due to Extenuating Circumstances </strong>- for absences due to extenuating circumstances (bereavement, family illness, varsity sports, etc.), students are required to complete the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances web form</a> (log in required) and upload their official documentation (e.g., plane tickets, court documents, police reports, etc.) to the site. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact instructors within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able given their circumstances.</li></ol><p><strong><u>Generative Artificial Intelligence</u>:</strong></p><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as critical reflection. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, Quillbot, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, <strong>is not permitted in this class</strong>. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of your work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p><u>Anti-racism Statement</u></p><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website</a>. </p><p><u>Intellectual Property</u></p><p>Be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of the instructor, teaching assistant, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof).</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides).</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or teaching assistant or used by the instructor or teaching assistant with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, teaching assistant and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, teaching assistant or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights and academic integrity. </p><p><u>Territorial Acknowledgement</u></p><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory">CAUT Guide to Acknowledging First Peoples and Traditional Territory</a>.</p><p><strong><u>Health and Well-being Supports and Resources</u></strong>:</p><p><i>You are a valued part of our community. We recognize that our individual identities shape our experiences in higher education. Some of us disproportionately encounter systemic barriers to belonging. University life can be difficult with multiple demands. The Faculty of Health is committed and actively working to foster an environment where you belong and can thrive. You may experience stressors that can impact your personal well-being and academic experience, but there are multiple supports and resources available to you on and off-campus. </i></p><p><strong>Academic advisors</strong> – <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/health/current-undergraduates/advisors">https://uwaterloo.ca/health/current-undergraduates/advisors</a></p><p><strong>Association of Health Students Undergraduate Members (AHSUM)</strong> - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/association-health-students-undergraduate-members/">https://uwaterloo.a/association-health-students-undergraduate-members/</a></p><p><strong>Athletics and Recreation </strong>- <a href="http://warriors.uwaterloo.ca/">http://warriors.uwaterloo.ca/</a></p><p><strong>Campus Wellness - Counselling and Health Services </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</a></p><p><strong>Co-operative Education -</strong> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/">https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/</a></p><p><strong>Empower Me - Student Assistance Program</strong> – <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-supports/empower-me/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-supports/empower-me/</a></p><p><strong>Food Support Service </strong>– <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/food-support-service/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/food-support-service/</a></p><p><strong>Glow Centre for Sexual and Gender Diversity </strong>– <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/glow/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/glow/</a></p><p><strong>Good 2 Talk </strong>(free, confidential support services for post-secondary students in ON)<strong> </strong>–<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.good2talk.ca">www.good2talk.ca</a> or 1-866-925-5454</p><p><strong>Here 24 Seven </strong>(addictions, mental health &amp; crisis services Waterloo-Wellington)<strong> </strong>- <a href="http://www.here247.ca">www.here247.ca</a> or 1-844-HERE247 (1-844-437-3247)</p><p><strong>International Student Resources </strong>– <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/international-experience/international-student-resources">https://uwaterloo.ca/international-experience/international-student-resources</a></p><p><strong>Off Campus Community</strong> - <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/off-campus-community/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/off-campus-community/</a></p><p><strong>Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/</a></p><p><strong>Office of Indigenous Relations – Student Supports and Clubs - </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/student-resources/student-supports-and-clubs">https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/student-resources/student-supports-and-clubs</a></p><p><strong>Racial Advocacy for Inclusion, Solidarity and Equity (RAISE) </strong>- <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/raise/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/raise/</a></p><p><strong>Student Financial Services </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/student-financial-services">https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/student-financial-services</a></p><p><strong>Student Legal Protection Program </strong>– <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-supports/student-legal-protection-program/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-supports/student-legal-protection-program/</a></p><p> <strong>Student Success Office </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/">https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/</a> </p><p><strong>UW Mates Peer Support</strong> – <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/mates/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/mates/</a></p><p><strong>Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) </strong>– <a href="https://wusa.ca/about/">https://wusa.ca/about/</a></p><p><strong>weCONNECTu Peer Mentorship Program (Faculty of Health) </strong>– <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/health/current-undergraduates/first-year/mentorship-program">https://uwaterloo.ca/health/current-undergraduates/first-year/mentorship-program</a></p><p><strong>Writing and Communication Centre </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/">https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/</a></p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
