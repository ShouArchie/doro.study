<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
</p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4><strong>Course Policies</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Grade disputes</strong>: Students have two weeks after assignment grades are released to discuss a change of grade/regrading. After this time, grades are final barring any calculation errors. You are welcome to discuss your assignment with a member of the teaching team at any time, but there will be no grades adjustments after the two-week period. The aim of this policy is to ensure that students are monitoring their course progress in a timely manner.</li><li><strong>Grade adjustments</strong>: The course instructor reserves the right to adjust student grades at their discretion at any point prior to the submission of final grades. This includes adjustments to grading decisions made by Teaching Assistants and/or peer evaluators. Students will be informed of any grade changes in writing.</li></ul><h4><strong>Departmental Policies</strong></h4><p>Please familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/recreation-and-leisure-studies/current-undergraduate-students/important-academic-information/late-assignments-missed-exams">departmental policies</a> regarding late assignments, missed quizzes and examinations, and reweighing of assignments. </p><h4><strong>Student Absences and Late Assignments</strong></h4><p>It is your responsibility to be aware of the procedures related to absences due to short-term extenuating circumstances. The expectations outlined below are in operation University-wide and apply to all courses in Winter 2024. Please review these guidelines and be prepared to follow them should it become necessary for you to do so this term. </p><p>Should you require support for a long-term medical condition, please contact AccessAbility Services or Counselling Services.</p><h4>COVID-19-Related Absence</h4><p>Students must complete a Student Absence Declaration in Quest if they are seeking accommodation from an instructor for missed course requirements due to COVID-19 illness or self-isolation. </p><p>This form is to be completed only for an absence <strong>up to 10 days</strong> related to <strong>COVID-19</strong> or an absence as a result of a <strong>requirement to self-isolate</strong>. Absences longer than 10 days must be verified using the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/sites/ca.campus%20wellness/files/uploads/files/verification_of_illness_form.v2_use.pdf">Verification of Illness Form (VIF)</a>. </p><p>The number of self-declared COVID-19-related absences is limited to <strong>one per student per academic term</strong>, and this self-declaration will be automatically sent to all of your course instructors. Students will also be sent a confirmation email to their uWaterloo account. </p><p>Students must contact their course instructor(s) <strong>within 48 hours</strong> of a test, exam, or due date to arrange for accommodation or consideration. </p><p>Students can find instructions on how to self-declare an absence in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">Personal Information section of Quest</a>. </p><h4>Short-Term (Two Days) Absence</h4><p>Undergraduate students may self-declare a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences">short-term absence</a> for any reason (e.g., other illnesses such as tonsillitis or migraine, injury, accidents, etc.).</p><p>A one-time self-declared short-term absence will excuse students from all assessments for <strong>up to two (2) days </strong>during <strong>the formal lecture period (i.e., not applicable during the final exam period)</strong>. </p><p>Students may <strong>not</strong> use their short-term self-declared absence for accommodations related to classes scheduled with a component of Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU), and instructors are permitted to deny such requests. </p><p>After two days, the student will be required to submit a University of Waterloo Verification of Illness Form or register for academic accommodation with AccessAbility Services (depending on the nature of the absence). </p><p>Only <strong>one short-term absence can be self-declared per academic term</strong>, and it will be distributed to all course instructors. Students are required to contact their instructor(s) within the <strong>first 24 hours</strong> of their absence to discuss possible accommodations for missed deadlines. </p><p>You will see a confirmation message upon submission of your absence, as well as receive a confirmation email to your uWaterloo email account. </p><h4>Any Other Absence</h4><p>For absences that do not meet the COVID-19 or Short-Term Absence criteria or exceed the maximum number permitted per term students must submit a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus%20wellness/sites/ca.campus-wellness/files/uploads/files/verification_of_illness_form.v2_use.pdf">Verification of Illness Form (VIF)</a>. </p><h4>Documentation Requirements</h4><p>Students who are required to provide a Verification of Illness Form can send them directly to <a href="mailto:health-vif@uwaterloo.ca">health-vif@uwaterloo.ca</a> for processing (i.e., instead of sending via email to your instructor[s]). </p><p>More information can be found under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/health/current-undergraduates/student-success/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Submitting a Verification of Illness Form (VIF) and/or other supporting documentation</a>. </p><h4>Accommodations by Instructors</h4><p>When an accommodation is requested, the form the accommodation takes is up to the instructor and may include options such as an extension, re-weighting, and an INC grade. </p><h4>Questions</h4><p>If you have questions about these procedures, please contact Leeann Ferries, the Faculty of Health Associate Dean, Undergraduate Studies: <a href="mailto:lferries@uwaterloo.ca">lferries@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><h4><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of the course author, Zara Rafferty, and any guest lecturers. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture presentations, videos, and other materials prepared for the course;</li><li>Questions and solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work created by the course author, instructor, or guest lecturer, or used by the instructor, guest lecturer, or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. You are provided you with robust course materials to support your success in the classroom. However, sharing this intellectual property without permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. </p><p>You may not distribute or reproduce the materials, whether for commercial purposes or not, without the express written consent of the owner. Neither the faculty nor instructors waive their intellectual property rights when granting limited use of their course materials to students.</p><p>There are <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external">institutional guidelines</a> pertaining to organizations external to the University of Waterloo that make available teaching resources from the University of Waterloo. Uploading course materials, including lectures, quizzes, and exams, onto online sharing platforms such as Course Hero, OneClass, and similar platforms is considered a copyright violation, regardless of whether an individual did so intentionally or unintentionally. Ignorance of the law is not an excuse.</p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The Waterloo campus of the University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, land that was granted to the Haudenosaunee of the <a href="https://www.sixnations.ca/"><u>Six Nations of the Grand River</u></a>, and is within the territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabe, and Haudenosaunee peoples.</p><p>Our ability to be working and living here now—in Waterloo Region, in Ontario, in Canada—is a direct benefit of policies of expulsion and assimilation of Indigenous peoples during the time of settlement and Confederation, and since. The harms of these policies are many and are still being felt in Indigenous communities today.</p><p>We have a responsibility, as such beneficiaries, to acknowledge and understand this history and the current experiences of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples, and for this understanding to inform the work that we do, so that, first, we can stop perpetuating the damages of colonization, and, second, to begin to repair them. Territorial acknowledgements are just one small, first step in doing this work.</p><p>Upon whose land do you live, work, teach, and learn?

Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
