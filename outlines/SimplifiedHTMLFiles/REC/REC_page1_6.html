  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h3>Important Academic Information</h3><p>Important academic information pertaining to the University of Waterloo and Department of Recreation and Leisure Studies handbooks can be found on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/recreation-and-leisure-studies/current-undergraduate-students/important-academic-information"><u>Recreation and Leisure Studies website</u></a>. </p><h3>Late Assignments</h3><ol><li>Assignments are due on the dates indicated in the Course Schedule in LEARN. In general, assignments are due on Fridays, with the exception of the Final Placement Simulation Reflection which is due during the final exam period and may fall on a different day.<ul><li>Late assignments are not accepted unless Buffer Days are used.</li><li>Please review our Buffer Days procedures document in the Activities and Assignments section in LEARN which have been designed to provide some extra self-managed time on assignment deadlines.</li></ul></li><li>In general, exceptions will only be made under unforeseeable and extraordinary circumstances. Evidence of such circumstances must be provided to the instructor in the form of supporting documentation from an appropriate source e.g., <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services"><u>Verification of Illness Form</u></a>. Students with acceptable documentation must contact the instructor <strong>no later than 48 hours after a due date</strong> to make alternate arrangements.</li><li>In special unforeseeable circumstances where due dates cannot be met, <strong>it is the student’s responsibility </strong>to provide acceptable written documentation substantiating the reasons for not meeting the deadline. When exceptional circumstances have been adequately communicated and documented, there will be no penalty assigned; if no contact is made, a mark of “zero” will be given.</li><li><strong><u>Important</u>: please review the absences policy document in the Absences section in LEARN to ensure you're following the most up-to-date guidelines related to illness and other absences.</strong></li></ol><h3>Reweighing of Assignments</h3><p>The Department of Recreation and Leisure Studies will not allow any after-the-fact reweighing of assignments or exams due to poor performance.</p><p>See the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/recreation-and-leisure-studies/current-undergraduate-students/important-academic-information"><u>Department of Recreation and Leisure Studies' Important Academic Information</u></a> site for more details.</p><h3>Grading</h3><p>If students have questions or concerns about a grade they have received, they should contact the person who evaluated their work to seek clarification.</p><p>Students may challenge a grade in the <strong>two-week period</strong> after the assignment mark is released. After that point, grades become final, barring any calculation errors which will be adjusted at any time.</p><p>The course instructor reserves the right to adjust student grades at her discretion at any point prior to the submission of final grades. This includes adjustments to grading decisions made by Teaching Assistants, peer evaluators, or others. Students will be informed of any grade changes in writing.</p><h3>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) </h3><p>GenAI that is trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code (e.g., Chat GPT, DALL-E, GitHub CoPilot) is permitted for some uses in this course (i.e., not all uses are permitted, and these guidelines apply to this course only.). </p><p>Proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement of GenAI use is required as it is for any other source you may consult and reference (e.g., journal articles, textbooks). Unauthorized use of GenAI in this course, such as submitting content generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) without proper attribution, or representing content generated by AI as your own idea or work will be considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> and treated as such. </p><p><strong>Permitted uses of GenAI</strong>: </p><ul><li>Brainstorming or generating prompts/examples that encourage reflection</li><li>Refining your original idea</li><li>Supporting your editing process</li></ul><p><strong>Prohibited uses of GenAI</strong>: </p><ul><li>Representing content generated by GenAI as your own without proper attribution.</li><li>Using GenAI without documenting your process or proper attribution.</li><li>Sharing copyright-protected materials with open access GenAI (e.g., inputting any course materials, such as lecture content, into a GenAI tool).</li></ul><p><strong>If you choose to use GenAI, you must ensure you</strong>: </p><ul><li>Maintain primary authorship and your own voice throughout your work.</li><li>Critically assess and evaluate whether output from GenAI is factual, verifiable, and relevant.</li><li>Do not rely on GenAI as your primary or sole source of information.</li><li>Attribute GenAI use properly using APA for all submissions.</li><li>Maintain documentation of where/how you’ve used GenAI in case proof is requested by the course instructor or Associate Dean (e.g., outlines, drafts, rough notes, GenAI prompts used, references generated, etc.)</li><li>Remember that you remain responsible for ensuring that your use of AI tools complies with copyright and intellectual property laws.</li></ul><p><strong>Resources for using GenAI</strong>: </p><ul><li>To learn more about documenting and citing Generative Artificial Intelligence, visit the Writing and Communication Centre's <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/Resources-AI-Citing">AI and the Writing Process – Documenting and Citing page</a> or the Library's <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai">Research Guide on Generative Artificial Intelligence</a>.</li><li>The Writing and Communication Centre has a great resource on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/Resources-AI-Overview">Using ChatGPT and other Text-Generating Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)</a> and how to be productive and ethical in your use of GenAI as well as cautions and risks to consider.</li></ul><h3>Intellectual Property</h3><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of the instructor, Zara Rafferty, and any guest lecturers. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording or transcripts thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and,</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or guest lecturer, or used by the instructor, guest lecturer, or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. I purposefully provide you with robust lecture notes and assignment outlines to support your success in the classroom. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a<strong> </strong>violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, <strong>it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</strong></p><p>Students may not distribute or reproduce the materials, whether for commercial purposes or not, without the express written consent of the faculty or instructor. <strong>Neither faculty nor the instructors waive their intellectual property rights when granting limited use of their course materials to students</strong>.</p><p>There are institutional guidelines pertaining to organizations external to the University of Waterloo that make available teaching resources from the University of Waterloo.<strong> Uploading course materials, including lectures, quizzes, and exams, onto online sharing platforms such as Course Hero, OneClass, and similar platforms is considered to be a copyright violation, regardless of whether an individual did so intentionally or unintentionally</strong>. Ignorance of the law is not an excuse.</p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The Waterloo, Kitchener, and Cambridge campuses of the University of Waterloo are situated on the Haldimand Tract, land that was granted to the Haudenosaunee of the Six Nations of the Grand River, and are within the territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabe, and Haudenosaunee peoples.</p><p>Through this statement, we are publicly acknowledging the history of the land we are situated on in order to re-visibilize Indigenous peoples, whose existence and struggles have been largely absent from the Canadian consciousness for hundreds of years, and also to collectively reflect on our role in repairing our nation’s relationship with the original inhabitants of Turtle Island (Canada).</p><p>Our ability to be working and living here now—in Waterloo Region, in Ontario, in Canada—is a direct benefit of policies of expulsion and assimilation of Indigenous peoples during the time of settlement and Confederation, and since. The harms of these policies are many and are still being felt in Indigenous communities today.</p><p>We have a responsibility, as such beneficiaries, to acknowledge and understand this history and the current experiences of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples, and for this understanding to inform the work that we do, so that, first, we can stop perpetuating the damages of colonization, and, second, to begin to repair them. Land acknowledgements are just one small, first step in doing this work.</p><p>Statement created by <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/faculty-association/about/land-acknowledgement"><u>FAUW</u></a></p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
