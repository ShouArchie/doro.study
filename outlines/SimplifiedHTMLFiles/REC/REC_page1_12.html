<h2><strong><u>Assignments and Evaluation</u></strong></h2><h3>1. Processing Script - 25% Due: Thursday, February 13th at 11:59pm</h3><p>Each student will write an original processing script, which will simulate a session with a therapeutic recreation practitioner and 2-3 clients. An introduction should be included to provide the necessary context for the session. Following the script, you will discuss the various processing techniques and strategies used along with a rationale supporting each selection. The script should be approximately 2-3 pages (single-spaced within each role and double-spaced between roles) with 2-3 pages discussing the various strategies used along with supporting rationale. Academic sources should be cited for all processing strategies identified. The modality you have chosen to address in your script must be different from your facilitation presentation topic. Further information will be provided in class.</p><h3>2. Facilitation Presentation - 25% Due: Date based on course schedule</h3><p>There are 18 facilitation topics/modalities with two facilitators for each topic (you are working in pairs). Submit your top five choices of topic and the name of your co-facilitator to the instructor no later than Friday, January 24, 2025 (via email). If you would like a partner assigned to you, please let me know. Topics will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.</p><p>Based on the literature, the facilitators will determine the client group receiving the technique. By 11:59 p.m. on the THURSDAY prior to your presentation, you, the facilitators, will post a summary of the client roles identifying the needs and issues of the client group (maximum 2 pages) on the course website via Learn. This summary should be detailed enough so each participant can play the assigned client role. The class is responsible for reading this summary and, if assigned to a client role, coming to class prepared to adopt the role.</p><p>Each presentation will be allotted a total of 30 minutes, with two presentations per class. The time will be used for group facilitation, which includes processing throughout or debriefing at the end of your activity/experience.</p><h3>3. Facilitation Summary Sheet - 10% Due: By 11:59pm on the THURSDAY prior to your presentation - see topic dates on the course schedule</h3><h4>Facilitation Summary Sheet (1 double-sided page):</h4><ul><li>Include a summary of your facilitation topic and an overview of the related theories</li><li>Include research discussing the efficacy of the TR modality related to the various client groups that have or would benefit from this technique (who has been shown to benefit)</li><li>Recommendations for TR practitioners regarding this modality</li><li>Include some resources for future use (e.g., journal articles, community groups, associations, etc.)</li></ul><h3>4. Presentation Evaluations and Involvement - 15% (throughout the term)</h3><p>This is an interactive class. Preparation for participation and active involvement is required. You will be asked to assume an evaluator role or a participant role for the facilitation presentations. You must be prepared to participate, having read the client role summaries identifying client needs and issues posted on the course website. Students’ evaluations and contributions to the facilitation presentations will contribute to the final mark. Further information will be provided in class.</p><h3>5. ePortfolio Reflection Assignment - 25% Due: Thursday, April 10 at 11:59pm - share link through PebblePad </h3><p>The ePortfolio reflection assignment provides you with a safe space to share what you have learned in the course using evidence to demonstrate this. You will be required to include five (5) reflections and related digital artifacts, one of which will be your facilitation presentation reflection, within your ePortfolio for grading. Your ePortfolio will allowing you to reflect critically on the class and what you have learned. Additional information and instructions will be provided in class.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Course Communication </h4><p><strong>UW LEARN (</strong><a href="www.learn.uwaterloo.ca"><strong>www.learn.uwaterloo.ca</strong></a><strong>):</strong></p><p>Students should check the course site for important announcements, information, to access lectures, locate readings, etc. I will post all relevant course documents on our LEARN site, including: the course outline, course schedule, readings and additional resources. On LEARN, you will also find assignment descriptions, assignment dropboxes and grades.</p><p><strong>Email Protocol:</strong></p><p>We want to hear from our students, and we are interested in your thoughts, feedback, and input as we move through this course. Please allow 2 business days (i.e., Monday-Friday, 8:30 a.m. – 4:30 p.m.) for a response to your email. If that amount of time elapses without a response, it is then appropriate to send a follow-up message. <strong>Please do not send the same email to more than one person individually</strong>, you might receive conflicting answers. Use CC if you would like to communicate with both the instructor and a TA. </p><p><strong>A special note on email and questions:</strong> We work hard to get all the course materials ready for you and make them accessible in a variety of ways/formats. Should we start to receive questions where the information is readily available in the syllabus or on LEARN, our responses will simply direct you to those spaces (e.g., “You should check LEARN for the answer to that question”).</p><p>Official university correspondence is conducted using your University of Waterloo email address. You are expected to check your email on a regular basis.</p><p><strong>Attendance:</strong></p><p>Each student should understand the expectation is to attend classes unless prevented from doing so because of an illness or extenuating personal circumstance. Failure to attend all regularly scheduled sessions will compromise the student’s mastery of the material, and may adversely affect their performance in the course.</p><p>Students will be required to assume evaluator and participant roles during the facilitation presentations. If you are scheduled to be a participant and are unable to attend the presentation,<strong> it is the student’s responsibility to inform the group presenting and arrange for role coverage (asking someone in the class to assume your role)</strong> as far in advance as possible. If you are an evaluator and will be absent, please let me know.</p><p>It is your responsibility to complete the assigned preparatory work and come to class ready to draw on the material for discussion and class participation – please stay on top of this work!</p><h4>Department Policy Regarding Late Assignments</h4><ol><li>Assignments are due in accordance with the dates indicated in the course outline. 10% will be immediately deducted if they are not submitted on time. An additional 10% will be deducted each day (including weekends) until the assignment is submitted.</li><li>Exceptions will only be made under unforeseeable and extraordinary circumstances. Evidence of such circumstances must be provided to the instructor in the form of supporting documentation from an appropriate source e.g. doctor’s certificate, copy of obituary, letter from Counselling Services, etc. Students with acceptable documentation must contact the instructor no later than 48 hours after the due date to make alternative arrangements. In special unforeseeable circumstances where due dates cannot be met, it is the student’s responsibility to provide acceptable written documentation substantiating the reasons for not meeting the deadline (the “Request for Variance from a Course Outline” form may be used for this purpose). When there are exceptional circumstances, there will be no penalty assigned; if no contact is made, a mark of “zero” will be given.</li></ol><p><strong>Buffer Days: </strong>Two buffer days are incorporated into this course. Buffer days give students more flexibility with assignment deadlines. Moving an assignment deadline back a day will require the use of 1 buffer day. A submission deadline can be extended up to two days. Buffer days can be used only for the <strong><u>processing script assignment</u></strong> and the <strong><u>ePortfolio reflection assignment</u></strong>, not the facilitation presentation and related components. YOU MUST EMAIL THE INSTRUCTOR PRIOR TO THE DUE DATE INDICATING IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON USING A BUFFER DAY. If you end up not using all of the buffer days you predict to be needed, unused buffer days will be returned to you. If this occurs, please advise the TA to ensure your remaining day is returned. The usual departmental policy (i.e., 10% late mark deductions per day) will be applied to late assignments that are submitted late with no buffer days to cover them. If you require an exemption due to illness or serious extenuating circumstances, please follow the current policy to receive consideration.  </p><h4>Student Illness</h4><p>See LEARN for posted documentation around the Absence Policy. Students may self-declare an absence and <strong>must </strong>notify their instructor(s) within 48 hours of a missed deadline or test. Adjustment of due dates or deferrals of term test or final exams are not automatic upon the self-declaration of illness.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as processing skills and reflective writing. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus support if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><h4>Health and Well-being Supports and Resources</h4><p>You are a valued part of our community. We recognize that our individual identities shape our experiences in higher education. Some of us disproportionately encounter systemic barriers to belonging. University life can be difficult with multiple demands. The Faculty of Health is committed and actively working to foster an environment where you belong and can thrive. You may experience stressors that can impact your personal well-being and academic experience, but there are multiple supports and resources available to you on and off-campus.</p><p><strong>Supports and Resources:</strong></p><p>Academic advisors - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-undergraduates/advisors ">https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-undergraduates/advisors </a></p><p>HEALTH weCONNECTu Peer Mentorship Program - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-undergraduates/first-year/mentorship-program">https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-undergraduates/first-year/mentorship-program</a></p><p>Athletics and Recreation - <a href="http://warriors.uwaterloo.ca/">http://warriors.uwaterloo.ca/</a></p><p>Campus Wellness - Counselling and Health Services - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</a></p><p>Empower Me - Student Assistance Program - <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/empower-me">https://wusa.ca/services/empower-me</a></p><p>Food Support Service - <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/food-support-service/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/food-support-service/</a></p><p>Glow Centre for Sexual and Gender Diversity - <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/glow/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/glow/</a></p><p>Good 2 Talk - Support for post-secondary students in ON &amp; NS <a href="www.good2talk.ca">www.good2talk.ca</a> or 1-866-925-5454</p><p>Here 24 Seven - Addictions, Mental Health &amp; Crisis Services Waterloo-Wellington <a href="www.here247.ca">www.here247.ca</a> or 1-844-HERE247 (1-844-437-3247)</p><p>International Student Resources - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/students/international-student-resources">https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/students/international-student-resources</a></p><p>Off-Campus Community - <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/off-campus-community/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/off-campus-community/</a></p><p>Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office/resources-tools-get-support">https://uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office/resources-tools-get-support</a></p><p>Office of Indigenous Relations – Student Supports and Clubs - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/student-resources/student-supports-and-clubs">https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/student-resources/student-supports-and-clubs</a></p><p>Racial Advocacy for Inclusion, Solidarity and Equity (RAISE) - <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/raise/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/raise/</a></p><p>Student Financial Services - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/student-financial-services">https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/student-financial-services</a></p><p>Student Legal Protection Program - <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-legal-protection-program">https://wusa.ca/services/student-legal-protection-program</a></p><p>Student Success Office - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/">https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/</a></p><p>UW Mates Peer Support - <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/uw-mates">https://wusa.ca/services/uw-mates</a></p><p>University of Waterloo Information on COVID-19 - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/">https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/</a></p><p>Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) - <a href="https://wusa.ca/about/">https://wusa.ca/about/</a></p><p>Writing and Communication Centre - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/">https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/</a></p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
