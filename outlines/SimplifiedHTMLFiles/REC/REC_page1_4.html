<p>As the title implies, this course provides an overview of the foundations of therapeutic recreation. In this course, you will learn about the importance of having a philosophy, values/virtues and ethics that guide therapeutic recreation practice. The course examines therapeutic recreation in the context of diverse settings where therapeutic recreation professionals work, from clinical settings to more community-based settings, not-for-profit organizations, and social justice initiatives. It explores the different philosophical foundations and social theories that guide practice in these different settings and relevant to the critical exploration and practice of therapeutic recreation. Finally, it explores issues important to the practice of therapeutic recreation such as the therapeutic recreation process and practice models, specific therapeutic recreation facilitation techniques and modalities, program design, and approaches to assessment, documentation, and program evaluation.</p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>A detailed course schedule and checklist have been prepared to help you navigate different components of the course and ensure you do not miss an assignment deadline. The schedule provides the dates of all classes, the topic of focus for each class, and reminders of when preparatory work and other course assignments are due. The checklist was designed to help you keep track of the preparatory work and assignments you have completed for the course. I strongly recommend printing a copy of the course schedule and checklist and referring to them weekly. <strong>See Course Information on Learn for the full course schedule and assignment tracker.</strong></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Week</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Date</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Topic</strong></p></td><td colspan="2"><p><strong>Assignments, Tasks, and Other Notes</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"><p>1</p><p> </p></td><td><p>Jan 6</p></td><td><p><strong>Introduction to the course</strong></p></td><td colspan="2"><p><strong>Read: </strong>Course outline</p><p><strong>Read: </strong>Welcome announcement on LEARN</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jan 8</p></td><td><p><strong>Introduction to Therapeutic Recreation</strong></p></td><td colspan="2"><ul><li>Selecting a population to work with for Participant Case Study Portfolio Assignment – <strong>complete survey on LEARN by January 10 at 11:59pm</strong></li><li><strong>Week Two Preparatory Reflection Exercise Template due by 1:00 p.m. on January 13 in Week Two Dropbox</strong></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"><p>2</p><p> </p></td><td><p>Jan 13</p></td><td><p><strong>Introduction to Therapeutic Recreation Part II</strong></p></td><td colspan="2" rowspan="2"><ul><li>TR Teams for Group Project announced (check LEARN for more details and participant descriptions)</li><li>Team Building Presentation</li><li><strong>Week Three Preparatory Reflection Exercise Template due by 1:00 p.m. on January 20 in Week Three Dropbox</strong></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jan 15</p></td><td><p><strong>Working Effectively as a Team</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"><p>3</p><p> </p></td><td><p>Jan 20</p></td><td rowspan="2"><p><strong>Professional Ethics, Personal Values, and Professional Behaviours</strong></p></td><td colspan="2" rowspan="2"><ul><li>Class time to work on Team Contract</li><li><strong>Personal Perspectives Assignment Overview and Expectations </strong>(please read before class)</li><li><strong>Week Four Preparatory Reflection Exercise Template due by 1:00 p.m. on January 27 in Week Four Dropbox</strong></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jan 22</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"><p>4</p><p> </p></td><td><p>Jan 27</p></td><td rowspan="2"><p><strong>Theories Guiding Therapeutic Recreation Practice</strong></p></td><td colspan="2" rowspan="2"><ul><li>Doing Background Research</li><li><strong>Team Contract due January 31 by 11:59pm </strong>– one per team in Team Contract Dropbox</li><li><strong>Week Five Preparatory Reflection Exercise Template due by 1:00 p.m. on February 3 in Week Five Dropbox</strong></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jan 29</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"><p>5</p><p> </p></td><td><p>Feb 3</p></td><td rowspan="2"><p><strong>Therapeutic Recreation Processes and Practice Models</strong></p></td><td colspan="2" rowspan="2"><ul><li>Choosing a Practice Model to Support your Participant</li><li><strong>Week Six Preparatory Reflection Exercise Template due by 1:00 p.m. on February 10 in Week Six Dropbox</strong></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>Feb 5</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"><p>6</p></td><td><p>Feb 10</p></td><td rowspan="2"><p><strong>Principles of Therapeutic Recreation Assessment</strong></p></td><td colspan="2" rowspan="2"><ul><li><strong>Personal Perspectives Assignment due Wednesday, Feb 12 at 11:59pm</strong></li><li>Choosing an Appropriate Assessment Process</li><li><strong>Week Seven Preparatory Reflection Exercise Template due by 1:00 p.m. on February 24 in Week Seven Dropbox</strong></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>Feb 12</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><p><strong>February 15-23, 2025 - Winter Reading Break</strong></p><p><strong>No class or assigned work.

Each student will begin the term with <strong>three buffer days</strong> which can be used to push back assignment deadlines without penalty. Please see the full procedure for buffer days outlined on LEARN.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h2>Course Expectations</h2><h3><i><strong>Course Communication </strong></i></h3><p><strong>UW LEARN (</strong><a href="https://outline.uwaterloo.ca/view/www.learn.uwaterloo.ca"><strong>www.learn.uwaterloo.ca</strong></a><strong>):</strong></p><p>Students should check the course site for important announcements, information, to access lectures, locate readings, etc. I will post all relevant course documents on our LEARN site, including: the course outline, course schedule, readings and additional resources. On LEARN, you will also find assignment descriptions, assignment Dropboxes and grades.</p><p><strong>Email Protocol:</strong></p><p>We want to hear from our students, and we are interested in your thoughts, feedback, and input as we move through this course. Please allow 2 business days (i.e., Monday-Friday, 8:30 a.m. – 4:30 p.m.) for a response to your email. If that amount of time elapses without a response, it is then appropriate to send a follow-up message. <strong>Please do not send the same email to more than one person individually</strong>, you might receive conflicting answers. Use CC if you would like to communicate with both the instructor and a TA. </p><p><strong>A special note on email and questions:</strong> We work hard to get all the course materials ready for you and make them accessible in a variety of ways/formats. Should we start to receive questions where the information is readily available in the syllabus or on LEARN, our responses will simply direct you to those spaces (e.g., “You should check LEARN for the answer to that question”).</p><p>Official university correspondence is conducted using your University of Waterloo email address. You are expected to check your email on a regular basis.</p><p><strong>Attendance:</strong></p><p>Each student should understand the expectation is to attend classes unless prevented from doing so because of an illness or extenuating personal circumstance. Failure to attend all regularly scheduled sessions will compromise the student’s mastery of the material and may adversely affect their performance in the course.</p><p>It is your responsibility to complete the assigned preparatory work and come to class ready to draw on the material for discussion and class participation – please stay on top of this work! </p><h3><i><strong>Department Policy Regarding Late Assignments</strong></i></h3><p>Please familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/recreation-and-leisure-studies/current-undergraduate-students/important-academic-information/late-assignments-missed-exams">departmental policies</a> regarding late assignments, missed quizzes and examinations, and reweighing of assignments. </p><ol><li>Assignments are due in accordance with the dates indicated in the course outline. 10% will be immediately deducted if they are not submitted on time. An additional 10% will be deducted each day (including weekends) until the assignment is submitted.</li><li>Exceptions will only be made under unforeseeable and extraordinary circumstances. Evidence of such circumstances must be provided to the instructor in the form of supporting documentation from an appropriate source e.g. doctor’s certificate, copy of obituary, letter from Counselling Services, etc. Students with acceptable documentation must contact the instructor <strong>no later than 48 hours after a due date</strong> to make alternative arrangements. In special unforeseeable circumstances where due dates cannot be met, it is the student’s responsibility to provide acceptable written documentation substantiating the reasons for not meeting the deadline (the “Request for Variance from a Course Outline” form may be used for this purpose). When there are exceptional circumstances, there will be no penalty assigned; if no contact is made, a mark of “zero” will be given.</li></ol><h2>Course Supports</h2><h3><i><strong>Student Absences</strong></i></h3><p>It is your responsibility to be aware of the procedures related to absences due to illness or other reasons. The expectations outlined below are being implemented University-wide and apply to all undergraduate courses in Winter 2025. Please review these guidelines and be prepared to follow them should it become necessary for you to do so this term.</p><h3><strong>Absences in Quest</strong></h3><p> <strong>1</strong>.<strong> Religious or creed-related absence</strong></p><p>Undergraduate students can now submit a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#religious">Religious Observance Self-Declaration</a> in Quest. This allows students to register the dates of potential conflict with coursework. As the dates of important religious observances are generally known well in advance, students must consult with their instructors within two weeks of the announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought.</p><p><strong> 2. Short-term absence </strong>(once/term) – Undergraduate students only</p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#short-term-absence">self-declare</a> <strong>one short-term absence per term</strong> on Quest for any reason (no documentation required). A short-term absence covers up to two calendar days during the <i>formal lecture period</i>. Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), and Studio (STU) courses/class components do not qualify for accommodation as a result of a self-declared short-term absence. There is no expectation that a self-declared short-term absence be total; that is, students may elect to participate in any course and complete any course element(s) despite not being required to. It is the student’s responsibility to <strong>contact their instructors within the first 24 hours </strong>after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><p> <strong>3. COVID-19-related absence </strong>(once/term)</p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#covid-19">self-declare</a> an absence of up to 10 days due to COVID-19-related illness. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in online components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to <strong>contact their instructors within the first 48 hours</strong> after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><h3><strong>Absences Requiring Documentation - </strong><a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/admin#/"><strong>Absence Database</strong></a><strong> – </strong>Undergraduate students only</h3><p><strong> 1. Absence due to illness  </strong></p><p>When students are unable to meet academic obligations due to illness, they are required to complete the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances web form</a> (log in required) and upload their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/students/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/verification-of-illness-form-website-fillable-final_0.pdf">Verification of Illness Form</a> (VIF) to the site. The University of Waterloo Verification of Illness Form (VIF) is normally the only medical documentation accepted to support requests for academic consideration. Students should not submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to their instructors, teaching assistants, or advisors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able given their health condition. Once approved, the student and their instructors will receive a confirmation email of the student’s absence. Course instructors will determine how missed course components are accommodated.</p><p><strong> 2. Absence due to extenuating circumstances</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (bereavement, family illness, varsity sports, etc.), students are required to complete the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances web form</a> (log in required) and upload their official documentation (e.g., plane tickets, court documents, police reports, etc.) to the site. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact instructors within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able given their circumstances.</p><h3><i><strong>Co-op Interviews</strong></i></h3><p>Please schedule co-op interviews outside of class time. There are procedures in place to help mitigate <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts">co-op interview conflicts</a>. If you <strong>must</strong> miss a class due to a continuous round interview or other unavoidable conflict, it is your responsibility to connect with a colleague to clarify any missed lecture content. You must contact me <strong>in advance</strong> of the interview with proof of the interview and your Interview Conflict form to arrange a make-up for in-class assignments.

The aim of this policy is to ensure that students are monitoring their course progress in a timely manner. </i></p><h3><i><strong>Grade adjustments </strong></i></h3><p><i>The course instructor reserves the right to adjust student grades at her discretion at any point prior to the submission of final grades. This includes adjustments to grading decisions made by Teaching Assistants and/or peer evaluators.
