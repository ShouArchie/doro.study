<p><strong>1) Case Studies (90%)</strong><i><strong>                                              </strong></i><strong>                                                                        </strong></p><p>** Group Assignments 10% each (Case studies assigned on January 20, 27, February 3, 10, March 3, 10, 17, 24)                     </p><p>  *Final Individual Assignment 10% (March 31)                              </p><p>This course is comprised of online recorded lectures and in-person tutorials. During each week, a recorded lecture will be posted to Learn (typically on Monday afternoon). During the following tutorial, the class will be given a brief case that everyone must address. Your job will be to apply insights gathered from the recorded lecture and in the readings to resolve issues identified in the case. This process is intended to help you integrate materials we have covered in class. On the dates listed above, you will have devoted class time to work on your assigned tasks with the instructor on hand to offer any guidance you might require. For all but one case studies (i.e., March 31), students will discuss their case response with their fellow group members. The group then uses insight from all its members’ reports to create an ultimate response to the case. This group response is submitted on LEARN (one submission per group) prior to Friday at 11:59pm. A grade is assigned to the group report. This process protects the individual student because responses have all been edited, enhanced, and approved by several classmates prior to submission. The only exception to this process is March 31 where a final individual assignment will be submitted. </p><p>Following each assignment, groups will have the opportunity to submit a mark redistribution form. This form is only required of those groups whose members collectively agree work was not distributed fairly within their group. If your group members collectively indicate that you did not participate fully in the group submissions, you will not receive full credit. As a result, if you are having issues or difficulty within the group, it is <u>critical</u> that you address this immediately. If further mediation is required, please contact the course instructor (Brendan) as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>2) Intersectionality Learning Experience (10%)</strong></p><p>This course will encourage you to think critically about topics related to program evaluation in leisure services. Therefore, it is important to examine how our own unique perspectives and experiences may impact our social and political identities. The purpose of the intersectionality learning experience is to identify the advantages and disadvantages we have faced by exploring concepts such as implicit bias, equity, diversity, inclusion, and privilege. You will have access to this online module through LEARN. <strong>Due on February 24<sup>th</sup> at <u>8:30am</u></strong>.</p><p>Note: The course instructor reserves the right to adjust student grades at his discretion at any point prior to the submission of final grades. This includes adjustments to grading decisions made by Teaching Assistants. Students will be informed of any grade changes, and the rationale for the change, in writing.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
