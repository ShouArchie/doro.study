The intro videos <i><strong>must</strong> </i>be watched before attending the scheduled lab period as they will be replacing the usual in-person introduction to the experiment and equipment. To maximize the benefit of this, <strong>it is recommended that the intro videos be viewed as close in time as possible to your scheduled lab session</strong>. At the start of the lab session, the instructor will only issue a few important reminders and/or announce last-minute changes. They will remain present during the lab session, however, to answer any questions you may have while performing the experiment as well as help troubleshoot any problems you encounter. Experiments 1 and 2 are performed in room PHY 321; the remainder are performed in room PHY 318. The experiments will be completed with a single lab partner, or in a group of three if necessary due to logistical reasons. </p><h4><strong>STUDENT ABSENCES:</strong></h4><p><strong>Illness: </strong>If you are sick, please do not come to lab. If you are ill and do miss an experiment you must submit a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness Form</a> (VIF) to the <a href="http://absence.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Database</a> in order to receive an accommodation. This form can be filled out by a healthcare practitioner at Campus Wellness OR  your own family/private healthcare practitioner. Please only submit your forms to the Absence Database, do not email them to your Instructor. <strong>It is your responsibility to contact your Instructor to make them aware of your absence. You must make accommodations with your instructor within 1 week of the end of your VIF or else no accommodation can be guaranteed as the term progresses.</strong></p><p><strong>Creed/Religion:</strong> If you will be unable to attend a lab or meet a deadline due to a creed or religious observance you must complete the Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. As the dates of important religious observances are generally known well in advance, students must consult with your Instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date or lab for which academic accommodation is being sought. Since all the deadlines of this course are outlined in this Course Outline the two weeks will be counted from the first day of the term, if you reach out to your instructor after the two weeks there is no guarantee that an accommodation will be able to be made.</p><p><strong>Extenuating Circumstances:</strong> Students can request academic considerations for extenuating circumstances (bereavement, emergencies, University of Waterloo sanctioned academic or athletic events, etc.), and requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. You must provide and submit official documentation to the <a href="http://absence.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Database</a>, the supporting documentation will be considered similarly to a VIF. Documentation is required before any action can be taken. The supporting documentation should provide a reason for the absence and the impacted dates, some examples are: plane/train/bus tickets for emergency travel, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors, and counsellor letters. The previous lists is not exhaustive. <strong>It is your responsibility to contact your Instructor to make them aware of your absence.</strong></p><p><strong>Short-Term Absences</strong>: Students have the ability to declare a two-day absence to excuse themselves from most academic responsibilities for up to two consecutive calendar days. <strong>This does not apply to LAB courses, if a student declares a self-declared short-term absence and it overlaps with a component of this course they are still expected to complete/attend.</strong></p><p>More information about absences can be found <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-other-extenuating-circumstances">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Other absences:</strong> Any other absence is considered an "unapproved absence", and there will be no guarantee that an accommodation will be provided and is up to the discretion of your Instructor. Absences related to the course work or expectations of other classes--such as studying for midterms or completing assignments in other courses--will not be accommodated</p><p>If you have a chronic or on going issue that impacts your academics I would highly recommend you reach out to AccessAbility services (more information at the end of this outline) to determine a more comprehensive accommodation plan.</p><p><strong>Instructor Absence:</strong> If the instructor is unable to attend a live lab session (e.g. for COVID-19 self-isolation) then an alternate instructor/TA will take their place. If one is not available at short notice, then the lab session may be rescheduled and/or moved to a remote format. Please monitor your email and LEARN announcements for this type of information.</p>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Attendance Policy: </strong>You must attend your registered lab section times. The only exception to this is if you have received explicit permission to attend an alternate section. Such permission may only be granted for legitimate reasons (including, for example, verified illness, family emergencies, varsity travel). Midterm exams are not acceptable reasons to be granted permission, since this is a pre-scheduled class meet time. If you have a conflicting test or midterm exam, you should contact that course’s instructor to make alternative arrangements. If you miss a lab unexpectedly, you must make all reasonable attempts to contact your instructor as soon as possible. Failure to do so may result in a mark penalty or a missed lab.</p><p><i><strong>Missed labs will result in a grade of zero for that particular lab.</strong></i></p><p>In order to support the health and safety of students, those who have a permanent, temporary, or suspected disability/medical condition or pregnancy that may affect their ability to safely participate in/complete labs, are expected to contact <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a> and/or their course instructor to ensure that appropriate accommodations and preparations have been considered (see also the <strong>Note for students with disabilities</strong> below)</p><p><strong>Mental Health Support:</strong> All of us need a support system. We encourage you to seek out mental health supports when they are needed. Please reach out to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Campus Wellness and Counselling Services</a>.</p><p>We understand that these circumstances can be troubling, and you may need to speak with someone for emotional support. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/services/good2talk">Good2Talk</a> is a post-secondary student helpline based in Ontario, Canada that is available to all students.</p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted in a legally binding treaty to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Indigenous Initiatives Office</a>.</p><p><strong>Equity and Inclusion</strong>: In this course, you should expect to be treated fairly and with respect by everyone on the instructional team and all your peers. You should expect an equal opportunity to learn. You are also expected to behave fairly and respectfully toward everyone else and avoid behaviours that make it harder for others to be comfortable. Everyone in this course has equally earned their place. Please help to create a welcoming and inclusive environment by, for example, refraining from discussing a person’s appearance or making assumptions based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or other personal characteristics. If you have a concern about how you are being treated, some of the people you can contact include (in order of escalating seriousness): your instructor, the current Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy, the University of Waterloo’s Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Office at <a href="mailto:svpro@uwaterloo.ca">svpro@uwaterloo.ca</a> or the police on- or off-campus.</p><p><strong>Generative AI: </strong>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as analysis and discussion of experimental results. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, or images, like Chat GPT, or DALL-E, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
