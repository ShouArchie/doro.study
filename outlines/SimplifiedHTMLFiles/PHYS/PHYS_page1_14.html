<p><strong><u>Please get started on the first homework posted on MasteringPhysics.  If you paid for an e-text and/or MasteringPhysics last term, the code should carry over to both PHYS122 and PHYS124. You do not need to pay again and should be able to get into PHYS122/124 MasteringPhysics courses using the same username and password as you used in PHYS121. For PHYS122, there is a link at the left side of our LEARN page as there was in PHYS121.</u></strong></p><p>If you did not purchase a code last term, there is a 14-day free trial period on MasteringPhysics. PLEASE, use this feature and get started immediately. There is more information posted on the LEARN site.  If need to purchase the material, and you are taking both PHYS122 and PHYS124, you only need to purchase an e-text and access code for MasteringPhysics once. The code and/or text will work in both courses.  Just register fully in MasteringPhysics with your code for either course. When you then register for the second course (let’s say PHYS 124) Mastering will not prompt you for a new access code as it will recognize that you have already purchased access and will automatically grant you Mastering access in the second course. The same goes for e-text access.  <strong>You do not need to pay twice.</strong></p><p><i><strong>For more information on MasteringPhysics pricing and registration </strong></i><br/><i><strong>please see materials posted on LEARN (link on left side of the page) OR ASK DR.

<p><strong>Quizzes</strong><br/>There will be four quizzes scattered throughout the term. Two will be before the midterm exam and two will be after. The quizzes must be taken in your scheduled tutorial section (Friday, Monday or Tuesday) unless Dr. Cummings has given you prior permission otherwise.  <strong>The Friday quiz dates are as follows: Jan. 24, Feb. 7, March 7 and March 21. The Monday dates are as follows: Jan. 27, Feb. 10, March 10 and March 24.  The Tuesday dates are as follows: Jan. 28, Feb. 11, March 11 and March 25. </strong>(Or see the schedule above.)  Everyone gets to drop one quiz grade with, or without, a VIF/valid university excuse.  If you miss more than one quiz, please send the VIF covering the second or subsequent absence(s) to  Dr. Cummings.  </p><p><strong>Midterm Exam</strong><br/>The midterm will cover Weeks 1-5 and is scheduled for Wednesday<strong> Feb. 25 from 7-9 pm. </strong> Room and seating information will be distributed in the weeks before the midterm.  <strong>You MUST notify Dr. Cummings <u>immediately</u> if you know you have a conflict with the date.</strong>  <i>We will NOT consider conflicts for those who provide us with less than 7 days notice unless it is an emergency. </i>If you get sick or have some other last minute emergency and miss the midterm with an accepted, valid excuse, then the weight will be shifted to the final exam. </p><p><strong>Final Exam </strong><br/>This will be cumulative and is scheduled during the final exam period by the Registrar's Office.  As per university policy, if you miss the final exam with a valid excuse, you must take the make-up during or before the university make-up days which are held near the start of the next term.  If the final exam is not completed in this time period a grade of DNW will be submitted.</p><p><strong>Mastering Physics </strong><br/>There will be a MasteringPhysics assignment DUE WEEKLY, most weeks of the term.  The assignments will each contain about 15 required questions that should take approximately 2 hours to complete.  In addition, there will be one or more bonus question(s) that can be completed if desired.  Answering these bonus questions can make-up for points missed elsewhere on any MasteringPhysics assignment, or can result in a score for MasteringPhysics that is greater than 100%.  Scores over 100% “roll-over” into other Mastering Assignments, and even the other categories.  (Mastering is worth 10% of your grade.  If you end up with a score of 110% for Mastering, you will get 11% for the category which effectively just raises your overall grade by 1%).  10 points for the required questions will be dropped as well. Assignments are due on the Monday at 11:59 pm typically two weeks after the topic starts.  For example, the material covered in Week 1 is due on Monday in Week 3, on January 20.  You get 8 submission attempts.  Your score on multiple choice questions goes down each try.  Your score on numerical submission is not reduced if you get the answer within 8 attempts. Unfortunately, we can not give extensions on Mastering Physics assignments but the late penalty is small.  Your score is reduced by 0.2% for every hour (1% for every 5 hours late, or about 5% per day). <strong>The first assignment is due on January 20.</strong>  See the course calendar above for additional dates.</p><p>Generally, <strong>excused absences and AAS accommodations for missed course components do not excuse a</strong> student from a MasteringPhysics Assignment but rather only extend the period of time the student has to complete the assignment by the number of days covered by the excused absence.  So, please, keep working on your assignments unless you are debilitated. If you have incurred a late penalty on a MasteringPhysics assignment that you believe should be forgiven based on a VIF or other excused absence including AAS accommodation, please send an email to <a href="mailto:karenc@uwaterloo.ca">karenc@uwaterloo.ca</a> at the end of the term with the following information: Assignment number, VIF or other documentation of excused absence attached, or state the number of days covered by the VIF or excuse.  Any late penalties will be adjusted accordingly.  Please put "grade adjustment" in the subject line. </p><p><strong>Tutorials</strong><br/>Your grade in tutorial is calculated as <br/><u>5% Artifact score</u><br/><u>10% TA Check outs/Attendance</u></p><p><i>More information is below:</i><br/><u>Group Activities:</u> You will meet in groups once per week on Friday, Monday or Tuesday.  Group work will consist of various activities but often we will do either a conceptual tutorial or problem solving practice.  We will take short quizzes four times during the term.<br/><u>Group Structure</u>: You will be placed into learning groups of 3-6 people which will be changed at midterm.<strong>   </strong><br/><u>Learning Artifacts: </u> After your tutorial you will submit a written record of your own work on the tutorial, or your notes from your group meeting, as a “learning artifact".  <strong>Artifacts are submitted through CrowdMark as soon as possible after your tutorial session, but no later than Friday at 11:30  pm following your tutorial.  </strong>You are not allowed to submit the written work of a group member as part of your artifact. You talk and think with your group members, but you only submit your own work and notes. Work must not be typed unless an AAS accommodation is in place. <i>If you miss a meeting you can still submit your own work as your artifact for credit. </i><br/><u>TA Check-outs:  </u><i>Students should not leave their group meeting without having seen a TA for (at least) attendance.</i> Group members who are absent receive a score of zero for the check-out.  There are no make-ups.  <br/><u>Important Note Regarding TA check-out:</u> For students who are present at the tutorial, these “check-outs” will be scored on a scale of 1,2,3,4 out of 4.  <strong>The default score will be a 3 out of 4 or 75%. </strong> Most groups in PHYS122 will be quite good and will still get this score of 75%. Only the very best groups (top 10%) each session will get a 4 out of 4 or 100%. Groups who are not collaborating effectively will be reduced in score to a 2 or even a 1 in some cases. Please try to be collaborative and productive in your groups and don't expect a 100% in tutorial.  The typical score for tutorial is about 83%.<br/><u>Missed Tutorial Work</u><br/>If you have a VIF, 48-hour absence or other excused absence, we will drop both your TA Check-out/Attendance and Artifact scores for the week. In fairness to those students who do not get sick, we will drop one score for TA Eval and one for Artifact for everyone.  A VIF is not required for this, and a VIF or 48-hour absence does not get you additional drops.  If you have VIFs covering <i>more than one missed tutorial</i>, please contact Professor Cummings at the end of the term.</p><p><strong>Academic Integrity Comments: </strong>  Your answers for artifacts and tests must be hand-written unless you have accommodations. For tutorial artifacts, you work as a group in tutorial, but you write and submit your own artifact.  This can be done on a tablet if you wish, so long as it is hand-written.  </p><p>You can work with the internet and peers as much as you like for the MasteringPhysics assignments.  We <i>encourage</i> you to work with peers on those problem sets.  But, you must ultimately submit your own answers.  <u>And, don't confuse getting the assignment done with understanding the material! You won't be cheating if you get tons of help, but you also won't be getting ready for the tests.</u></p>

<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
