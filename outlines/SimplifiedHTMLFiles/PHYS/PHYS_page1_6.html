<p>The textbook is not required but a textbook is recommended. Only one textbook is needed.</p><p>The College Physics textbook by Serway is excellent.  The textbook price from the University bookstore is usually the cheapest in North America (although I have not checked in a couple years).  It is a good acquisition if you intend on writing a professional exam with a physics component in the future (it includes  a description of required topics for the MCAT). Any edition is good.</p><p>Any book you used for PHYS 111 is almost certainly fine as well.  College Physics: A Strategic Approach is an excellent book. Any edition is good.</p><p>Free textbook #1 (from openstax) is written at a low level while free textbook #2 (3 volumes) is a calculus based book.  I do not find that these books are great but they are available for no cost.</p>

<p><strong>Course expectations:</strong></p><p>In this course, you should expect to be treated fairly and with respect by everyone on the instructional team and all your peers.  You should expect an equal opportunity to learn.  You are also expected to behave fairly and respectfully toward everyone else and avoid behaviors that make it harder for others to be comfortable.  Please help to create a welcoming and inclusive environment.</p><p><strong>Weekly online assignments:</strong></p><p>Students may consult each other on assignments, with the expectation that most of the work submitted has been done individually. Working together is permitted. Please see the notes on academic integrity and discipline below.</p><p>The first assignment will be available at 8:00 am on Friday, January 10<sup>th</sup> and will be due at 8:00 am on Friday, January 17<sup>th</sup>. In the assignment, you have 5 attempts to get the answer.</p><p>Questions will be assigned each week starting Friday, January 10. All the assignment questions will be graded each week. The online assignment must be completed by the following Friday at 8:00 am. In other words, you have 7 days to complete the assignment. Some assignments have later due dates due to holidays, midterms and reading week. Check the due dates carefully. Late assignments will not be accepted.</p><p>Assignments will be completed using Mobius, which must be accessed through Learn. </p><p>There are a total of 11 weekly assignments and all are weighted equally. The lowest grade assignment will be dropped when calculating the average weekly assignment grade.</p><p><strong>Weekly self-marked assignments:</strong></p><p>Students may work together on self-marked assignments.</p><p>The first self-marked assignment will be available at 8:00 am on Friday, January 17<sup>th</sup> and will be due at 8:00 am on Friday, January 25th.</p><p>An exam-like problem will be posted each week on LEARN. You will enter your numerical solutions to the problem on LEARN within 7 days (the grade you see at this point will almost always be zero, this is normal). Solutions with a grading scheme will then be posted. You will compare your written solution to the problem with the posted solution and then assign yourself a grade consistent with the marking scheme using LEARN. Do not be too harsh in your self-assessment; feel free to consult with your instructor if in doubt.  Further details will be provided in class. Late assignments will not be accepted.</p><p>There are a total of 9 weekly self-marked assignments and all are weighted equally. The lowest grade assignment will be dropped when calculating the average weekly assignment grade.</p><p><strong>Participation (clickers):</strong></p><p>Clickers (REEF will work as well) will be used in class. The maximum grade is 3%. 2 points will be given for each clicker response with an additional 1 point for each correct response. Your clicker grade will be calculated as 3 * (your total clicker points) / (total clicker points possible during the semester). Note that clickers may not be used in all lectures and some lectures may have more questions than others. Clicker use will start the second week of class. Using more than one clicker in class will be considered a violation of academic integrity and will be reported to the Associate Dean.</p><p>Your clicker grade will be changed automatically to 3 if your calculated grade is 2.5/3 or higher (this is to accommodate unforeseen absences).</p><p><strong>Mid-term Test:</strong></p><p>One midterm is scheduled for this course. It will be a long answer midterm. The midterm will be hand marked and part marks will be given. All work must be shown to receive credit for any solutions. An equation sheet will be provided.</p><p>The midterm will be held Thursday, February 13, 2024 from 5:30-6:45 pm.</p><p>The location will be announced later on Learn. An equation sheet will be provided.</p><p><strong>Final Examination:</strong></p><p>This will be a two and a half hour exam scheduled by the Registrar’s office during the final exam period. The exam will cover the entire semester. An equation sheet will be provided. </p><p><strong>Help Session (tutorial):</strong></p><p>Tutorials are scheduled each week starting the week of January 13 (there are no tutorials the first week of class). The tutorial instructor will provide assistance in problem solving and with any difficulty you may encounter with the material covered in the lectures or assignments. You may attend more than one tutorial session each week but please give seating priority to those registered for the time slot.  The schedule and room locations for tutorials will be posted on learn.  Attendance is voluntary.  The tutorials provide an excellent opportunity to get additional help with the course.</p><p><strong>What happens if I join the course late:</strong></p><p>The lowest grade from each weekly component of the class will be dropped as described above (this may be an assignment that was missed due to late enrolment).  No additional accommodations will be granted.  If you join the course towards the end of the two week add period you could miss two of some of the graded components.  If this happens, one will be dropped from the final grade calculation and you will be assigned a grade of zero for the second.</p><p><strong>Class Rules:</strong></p><p>Laptops should only be used for course related purposes.</p><p>All cell phones must be set to silent mode.</p><p><strong>Conflicts with Scheduled Midterms:</strong></p><p>If you have conflicts with a midterm (<i>e.g.</i> religious activities, varsity sports competitions, other course commitments), contact your instructor <i><strong>at least two weeks prior to the midterm </strong></i>(or sooner, if possible) to explain the nature of the conflict and to discuss possible accommodations. Note that student travel plans are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an accommodation.</p><p><strong>What to do if you miss a graded component due to illness (or other reason, such as taking the 48 hour absence):</strong></p><p>Missed a regular assignment:</p><ul><li>The lowest grade will be dropped.  This will be the one that will be dropped.  If you are ill (or there are special circumstances) for a prolonged period of time, please contact the instructor to make an arrangement.</li><li>Remember that only one assignment will be dropped for the semester.  If you were busy one week and did not submit an assignment and then became ill later in the semester and missed another assignment, then only one of those assignments will be dropped, and the grade on the other assignment will be zero.  Please do not count on being able to drop multiple assignments for non medical (or other special circumstances) reasons.  Of course missing multiple assignments due to illness or accessibility reasons will be dealt with differently.</li></ul><p>Missed midterm or exam:</p><p>If you are ill you can either: self declare on learn or get a VIF (you can use your 48 hour absence as well if you like). To submit a VIF, follow the instructions at https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-other-extenuating-circumstances</p><p>If you do not write a midterm, and have not made an arrangement with your instructor, your grade will be zero on that midterm. </p><p>If you missed a midterm or exam due to illness or another valid reason (including the 48 hour absence), you can avoid a zero grade by following the steps below (there is one big condition, see number 4)</p><ol><li>Contact your instructor by email within 24 hours of the missed midterm or exam. Emails can be received 24 hours per day. If you are too sick to contact the instructor then please wait until you are better.</li><li>Your instructor will review the information then make a decision as to whether it will be accepted or if you will be assigned a grade of zero (not all reasons are valid). Students should carefully consider the wisdom of missing a midterm or exam.  Remember that falsely claiming you are ill can result in academic polices per Policy 71.</li><li>If the absence is accepted the weighting of the midterm will be transferred to the final exam (exam now worth 81%).</li><li>For exam absences: You will only be granted the opportunity to write a makeup exam if you are in good standing in the course. This means that you have attempted at least 60% of each of the weekly graded components and your average assignment grade must be over 50% (this is calculated over all assignments, not just the ones you attempted). If you have not completed at least 60% of the weekly graded components by their due dates and/or your assignment average grade is less than 50%, you will not be allowed to write a makeup exam and will receive a grade of DNW (a failure).  Please note that we do not make exceptions for this rule.</li></ol><p><strong>Sometimes Things happen</strong></p><p>For other extenuating circumstances that are not illness related, for which the Verification of Illness form is not appropriate, official documented proof that something has occurred will be required (consult with your instructor).  It is understood that sometimes events occur beyond your control so if in doubt, contact your instructor if you have a compelling reason.</p><p><strong>Email communications:</strong></p><p>We try to answer emails promptly (within a day or two) but sometimes the email volume is to large and we may miss your email.  If you have not heard back from within two days, please send your email again.  We prefer emails to messages sent on Teams.</p><p>Email requests to ask for extra credit or to have grades changed for no reason will be ignored.</p>
