  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Define and describe core concepts of classical mechanics (e.g., free fall, force, energy) and provide real-world examples to demonstrate their applications [KB, LL].</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Break down complex physical scenarios into their underlying principles, identifying relationships between forces, motion, and energy; for instance, by drawing free body diagrams [KB, PA].</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Identify known and unknown variables, organize given information, and formulate problem statements to solve physical problems effectively [KB, PA].</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Evaluate physical problems to determine the governing mechanical principles, such as Newton's laws, conservation laws, and kinematic equations, and apply them systematically [KB, PA].</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Solve for unknown quantities through algebra, calculus, and vector analysis, and validate results through unit consistency and order-of-magnitude estimates [KB, PA].</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Assess the plausibility of results by considering physical constraints, assumptions, and approximations, and identify discrepancies when outcomes deviate from expectations [KB, PA, LL].</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Present solutions and explanations in a structured, concise, and professional format to others (e.g., classmates, teammates, TAs, instructors), using appropriate mathematical notation, diagrams, and verbal descriptions [IaTW, LL].</td>
</tr>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>There are two grading schemes, and your final grade will automatically reflect the higher of the two. </p><h3>Missed Assessment Policy</h3><p>The lowest two quizzes, lowest two tutorial questions, and lowest two assignments will be dropped—regardless of the reason. If you miss a quiz, tutorial question, or assignment, it will be recorded as a zero for grade calculation purposes. However, if you miss the midterm for a university-approved reason, the weighting will be transferred to the final exam. Please also read Illnesses and Absences below.</p><p>As outlined below, your final mark incorporates both in-class and out-of-class activities, individual and teamwork, as well as test-based and non-test-based assessments. </p><h3>Participation in Lecture Sessions</h3><ul><li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Every Lecture Session</li><li><strong>Performance Metric:</strong> Individual Participation</li><li><strong>Level of Collaboration Allowed:</strong> Limited – Collaboration permitted only for designated think-pair-answer questions (See the “think-pair-answer” document on LEARN).</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> Each lecture session includes one or more in-class questions delivered through the Vevox platform.

Active teaching and learning are implemented throughout the course, so your engagement in the course activities is of paramount importance for your learning outcomes.</p><p>Lecture and tutorial sessions begin promptly at the scheduled time slot, so it is important that you arrive on time. Your attendance is monitored through different assessment components integrated into the course.</p><p>Note: This section is adapted from a similar section in the PHYS 115 course outline, Winter 2020.</p><h3>Problem Solving Skills</h3><p>The goal of the exams is to test your knowledge of the material as well as your problem-solving skills. While getting help will often be necessary, you will need to maximize your problem-solving proficiency. You must build the ability to solve problems independently within a limited amount of time, without assistance. The assigned problems are the minimum of what you should master. There is a strong alignment between the quizzes, assignments, practice problems, and exams.</p><p>TAs will mark the exams; hence, showing all your work and thought processes will be necessary for partial marks. Your grade will depend on clarity, organization, and correct presentation of solutions. The weekly quizzes are designed to help you practice problem-solving and solution presentation skills. You are encouraged to think critically, creatively, and develop confidence in approaching challenging problems.</p><p>Note: This section is adapted from a similar section in the PHYS 115 course outline, Winter 2020.</p><h3>Weekly Problem Sets</h3><ul><li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 12 Weekly Problem Sets</li><li><strong>Level of Collaboration Allowed:</strong> Allowed – Team collaboration is required during tutorial sessions and strongly encouraged outside of them.</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> Weekly problem sets include up to 10 questions that mirror quiz and exam formats. Students complete at least the first two questions in teams during tutorials and submit team progress reports. Solutions for the remaining questions can be collaboratively discussed outside tutorials. Solutions for the first two questions of each problem set are published after the marks for the associated individual and team quizzes have been completed.</li></ul><h3>Student Teams</h3><p>You are randomly divided into teams of three people. See the “Student Teams” documents on LEARN.</p><h3>Peer-to-Peer Discussions Channel on Discord</h3><p>There is a dedicated discussion channel for you on Discord. This channel focuses on improving course understanding and is intended for exchanging tips and discussing quizzes, assignments, problems, and lecture material. You are strongly encouraged to use this channel; however, you must not post or share answers to quizzes, assignments, or problems, or provide solutions for activities meant to be completed individually or in groups (Please see Administrative Policy and University Policy about academic integrity).</p><p>I frequently monitor this channel and try to address your questions as much as I can.</p><h3>Illnesses and Absences</h3><p>The following rules are set by the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/undergraduate-students/first-year"><u>First Year Office</u></a> at the Faculty of Engineering:</p><ul><li>One short-term self-declaration<ul><li>2 calendar days during lecture period only<ul><li>Cannot be used for in-person LAB or STU</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>One self-declaration of COVID-like symptoms<ul><li>Up to 10 days during lecture or exam period<ul><li>No documentation required</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Religious or creed-related absence<ul><li>Reason and dates of absence required for submission</li><li>Self-declaration through Quest</li></ul></li><li>Documentation required for other absences<ul><li>Students upload VIF or documentation to <a href="https://absence.uwaterloo.ca/"><u>https://absence.uwaterloo.ca</u></a> for approval by EUGO</li><li>Instructors will receive email notifications of student absences</li></ul></li></ul><p>See this <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/undergraduate-students/getting-support/declaring-absences"><u>webpage</u></a> for more details.</p><h3>Technologies Used in This Course</h3><h4><i>LEARN</i></h4><p>The main course repository is on the UW LEARN. You can access the UW LEARN via your UW UserID and QUESTpassword.
