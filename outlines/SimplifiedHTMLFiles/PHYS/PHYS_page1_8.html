<p>Physicists are in the business of measuring the energy levels of hydrogen to six significant figures, and the distance to far away stars with surprising accuracy. But how do we know when we have made a good measurement? How do we set ourselves up for success in these ventures? </p><p>This course will focus on developing experimental skills and critical thinking in data collection and analysis. Our primary goal is to leave you with skills, strategies, and attitudes that will be of value no matter what your future aspirations may be. You will learn how to make observations and measurements, how to build models that fit those measurements, and to derive meaning from the success or failure of those models. You will also learn a variety of technical skills including data-analysis techniques, keeping thorough laboratory notes, computer skills, statistical methods, and the ability to communicate results and ideas.</p><p>In this lab the experiments will formatted and designed in a different way compared to other Faculty of Science labs (CHEM, BIOL, etc.) or other labs you may have taken. The goal of this course is to teach you how to be a Scientist, not just to follow instructions. There will be times where you will be asked to figure out the best way to investigate a certain phenomena and will be given minimal instructions, the goal being to get you used coming up with ways to experimentally determine what you are looking for like scientists do when performing research. In some cases this may make it more difficult then other labs as you will not be given in-depth instructions for how to do things and need to rely on your own understanding and knowledge, but you should come out of this course being more confident in the aspects outlined in the previous paragraph. </p>

The TA will remain present through out the lab session to answer any questions you may have while performing the experiment as well as help troubleshoot any problems you may encounter. For each experiment you will work in groups of 2-3 students.</p><p><strong>You are required to attend your registered lab section time</strong>, you should not be attending any section that you are not scheduled for without permission from the course administrator.</p><h4><strong>STUDENT ABSENCES:</strong></h4><p><strong>Illness: </strong>If you are sick, please do not come to lab. If you are ill and do miss an experiment you must submit a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness Form</a> (VIF) to the <a href="http://absence.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Database</a> in order to receive an accommodation. This form can be filled out by a healthcare practitioner at Campus Wellness OR  your own family/private healthcare practitioner. Please only submit your forms to the Absence Database, do not email them to the Course Administrator. <strong>It is your responsibility to contact the Course Administrator to make them aware of your absence. You must make accommodations with your instructor within 1 week of the end date of your VIF or else no accommodation can be guaranteed as the term progresses.</strong></p><p><strong>Creed/Religion:</strong> If you will be unable to attend a lab or meet a deadline due to a creed or religious observance you must complete the Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. As the dates of important religious observances are generally known well in advance, students must consult with the Course Administrator within two weeks of the announcement of the due date or lab for which academic accommodation is being sought. Since all the deadlines of this course are outlined in this Course Outline the two weeks will be counted from the first day of the term, if you reach out to the Course Administrator after two week there is no guarantee that an accommodation will be able to be made.</p><p><strong>Extenuating Circumstances:</strong> Students can request academic considerations for extenuating circumstances (bereavement, emergencies, University of Waterloo sanctioned academic or athletic events, etc.), and requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. You must provide and submit official documentation to the <a href="http://absence.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Database</a>, the supporting documentation will be considered similarly to a VIF. Documentation is required before any action can be taken. The supporting documentation should provide a reason for the absence and the impacted dates, some examples are: plane/train/bus tickets for emergency travel, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors, and counsellor letters. The previous lists is not exhaustive. <strong>It is your responsibility to contact the Course Administrator to make them aware of your absence.</strong></p><p><strong>Short-Term Absences</strong>: Students have the ability to declare a two-day absence to excuse themselves from most academic responsibilities for up to two consecutive calendar days. <strong>This does not apply to LAB courses, if a student declares a self-declared short-term absence and it overlaps with a component of this course they are still expected to complete/attend.</strong></p><p>More information about absences can be found here: https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-other-extenuating-circumstances</p><p><strong>Other absences:</strong> Any other absence is considered an "unapproved absence", and there will be no guarantee that an accommodation will be provided and is up to the discretion of the Course Administrator. Absences related to the course work or expectations of other classes--such as studying for midterms or completing assignments in other courses--will not be accommodated</p><p>If you have a chronic or on going issue that impacts your academics I would highly recommend you reach out to AccessAbility services (more information at the end of this outline) to determine a more comprehensive accommodation plan.</p><h4><strong>MAKE-UP LABS:</strong></h4><p>If you miss an experiment you must email the Course Administrator as soon as possible. Your email must include the following:</p><ol><li>The course you are enrolled in</li><li>Section number</li><li>Reason for your absence (if it is due to an illness let the Course Administrator know you have submitted a VIF)</li></ol><p>If your absence is approved and the Course Administrator decides to arrange a make-up experiment then in most cases you will perform the experiment during a different scheduled lab session. In cases where you are performing a make-up lab, there is no guarantee that you will have a partner so ensure that you are well prepared for the experiment.</p>

<h4><strong>LAB NOTES:</strong></h4><p>Labs will be performed in groups of 2-3. <strong>Groups will submit one set of lab notes which are due at the end of the lab session, submitted to a Dropbox on LEARN. There will be a 5 minute grace period at the end of your lab session, but after that the Dropbox will be closed and no late submissions will be accepted for any reason (including technical). </strong>If for whatever reason you are having issues submitting your notes to the Dropbox on LEARN then you must email your submission to the Course Administrator <strong><u>before</u></strong> the deadline. Generally, you should aim to have a completed set of notes around 5 - 10 minutes prior to the deadline, this will allow you to use the remaining time to finalize and polish your submission. The grace period should not be treated like a blanket extension, it is there to accommodate any last minute issues you have, if you find yourself and your group working right to the final minute of the grace period you may want to reconsider how you are approaching the experiments.</p><p>The reason for these strict deadlines is to ensure the deadlines are fair to the students who managed their time effectively. To meet a deadline choices are made, whether that is to spend less time on certain sections, or adjust the process to make a measurement, all of which may have an impact on the grade. So to give some groups extra time while others have possibly made sacrifices to get their submission on time is not fair.</p><h4><strong>PRE-LAB READING QUIZZES:</strong></h4><p>Pre-Lab Reading Quizzes will be completed online, asynchronously. You will have unlimited attempts at the Pre-Lab Reading Quizzes. They should be completed individually, and students may use any course materials to guide their answers (i.e., "open book"). <strong>The Pre-Lab Reading Quizzes will have a deadline of 1 hour prior to the associated experiment.</strong></p><h4><strong>POST-LAB QUIZZES:</strong></h4><p>Post- Lab Quizzes will be completed online, asynchronously.

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p><strong>Equity and Inclusion: </strong>In this course, you should expect to be treated fairly and with respect by everyone on the instructional team and all your peers. You should expect an equal opportunity to learn. You are also expected to behave fairly and respectfully toward everyone else and avoid behaviors that make it harder for others to be comfortable. Everyone in this course has equally earned their place. Please help to create a welcoming and inclusive environment by, for example, refraining from discussing a person’s appearance or making assumptions based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or other personal characteristics. If you have a concern about how you are being treated, some of the people you can contact include (in order of escalating seriousness): your instructor, the current Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy, the University of Waterloo’s Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Office at <a href="mailto:svpro@uwaterloo.ca">svpro@uwaterloo.ca</a> or the police on- or off-campus.</p><p><strong>Accommodations: </strong>In order to support the health and safety of students, those who have a permanent, temporary, or suspected disability/medical condition or pregnancy that may affect their ability to safely participate in/complete labs, are expected to contact <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a> and/or their course instructor to ensure that appropriate accommodations and preparations have been considered (see also the <strong>Note for students with disabilities</strong> below)</p><p><strong>Mental Health Support:</strong> All of us need a support system. We encourage you to seek out mental health supports when they are needed. Please reach out to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Campus Wellness and Counselling Services</a>. You may also need to speak with someone for emotional support. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/services/good2talk">Good2Talk</a> is a post-secondary student helpline based in Ontario, Canada that is available to all students.</p><p><strong>Generative AI: </strong>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as data analysis. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
