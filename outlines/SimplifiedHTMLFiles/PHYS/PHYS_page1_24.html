<p>This lab course is designed as a stand-alone lab with minimum supervision, and as the prequel to the PHYS 360 A/B and then PHYS 460 A/B, thus the PHYS 260L is one of the harder (if not hardest) second year Physics lab. Students are required to make the link between the theory and the experiment, and to understand the direct link between the experiment and the physical phenomena being studied (The focus theory are introduced to students via video lectures)</p><p>The experiments use standard physical instruments, and with systematic execution, you are required to collect data, and analyze your data with clear and accurate reporting of results to demonstrate the validity of the theory used in the experiments.  It is expected that you have fundamental Physics background such as Ohm’s law, kinematics, Vector’s cross products, fundamental Electro-magnetic theory, fundamental optics, fundamental Quantum Mechanics etc. as we will use them but no separate module to covers these vast backgrounds.</p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>We are operating on 2-week cycles (as we are having scheduled lab session every other week) and the summary of the schedule is as follows:</p><ol><li>The week before scheduled lab: You are required to go through these materials and take notes of your concerns, questions for the scheduled lab session. Understand the experiment is the key to achieve good grade on the lab report as it leads to the proper execution of the experiment and the meaningful discussion and conclusion for your report!</li><li>The scheduled lab week: Lab will be held in PHYS 318 at 2:30 PM. There will be an introduction to the lab and equipment where all your concerns/questions will be addressed for your complete understanding of the experiment and the theory behind the experiment, then perform the lab and collect data. The present in the lab period is mandatory and no report will be accepted without performing the experiment.</li><li>The lab report is due by 5:30 PM one week from the scheduled lab period, using the drop box on LEARN. There will be a late penalty of 1 mark a day, and once marked labs are returned (7 days past due), we will not accept report for grading as it could jeopardize the academic integrity of the course (accommodation will not cover 7 days past due date for acceptance of late submission). The next lab’s cycle commences.</li></ol><p> </p>

<p>The lab report is due by 5:30 PM one week from the scheduled lab period, using the drop box on LEARN. There will be a late penalty of 1 mark a day, and once marked labs are returned (7 days past due), we will not accept report for grading as it could jeopardize the academic integrity of the course (accommodation will not cover 7 days past due date for acceptance of late submission)</p><p>Lab reports are to be done individually. A complete lab report shall include Purpose, data and analysis (Observations is qualitative data). Data/results should be presented together with analysis as it will allow you and the reader of your report all relevant information immediately for your analysis of results (If there are questions from the lab write up, it’s just our ways of telling you things that you will need to consider when doing such experiment, thus, just work the answer into your analysis). Discussion (make a good argument linking the results to known facts, theory and experiment) and a conclusion (the natural statement resulted from your discussion as to the validity of the theory behind the experiment and/or the experiment). Aside from the purpose (for the whole complete experiment), it is best to write the contents for the data and analysis, discussion, and conclusion right after each other for each section of the experiment (think of it as a complete mini experiment).</p><p>If you feel the need to have a separate Discussion and Conclusion sections, then be careful to have them as a summary to support your finding (be concise and avoid repetitive statements in different section of your report, good paper does not frivolously fill it with empty words by repeating statements).</p><p>Please see the “LabReportGuidelines260.pdf” in the content/resource tab for more details</p><p><strong>There will be a project in lieu of a final (Due date TBA). No late submission will be accepted as it is equivalent to an exam to be fair to all</strong>. The Project question will be posted about one week before the due date on Learn. (To do well in this project, you will need to understand the objectives and the executions of the experiments as it is start with a theoretical model, then the experimentalist design and execute the experiment to test the validity of the model. You must devise a model and design an experiment to fulfil the objective of the project. This is a hint to you that you will need to understand the theory behind all labs performed and what you did in all the labs because of such theory). </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as to making the link between the theory and the experiment, and to understand the direct link between the experiment and the physical phenomena being studied and proceeding with a comprehensive report of their works. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.
