<p>Additional details regarding each type of assessment metric is provided below for your reference.</p><p><strong><u>ASSIGNMENTS:</u></strong></p><ul><li><i><u>Frequency</u></i>: 7x Throughout the Term</li><li><i><u>Performance Metric</u></i>: Individual</li><li><i><u>Level of Collaboration Allowed</u></i>: <strong>None - Screening for Plagiarism Active</strong></li><li><i><u>Description</u></i>: Approximately every 1-2 weeks, you will be asked to submit an assignment for grading. These assignments provide you with a chance to apply the knowledge you have learnt to foundational problems for various topics. All assignments are to be submitted to Crowdmark for grading.</li><li><i><u>Grading</u></i>: Based on accuracy of solutions, quality/clarity of solutions</li><li><i><u>Late Penalty</u></i>: 10% per day up to 30% (Day 3), then 100% grade deduction unless a VIF or approved exemption is provided</li></ul><p><strong><u>MOCK CONFERENCE PROJECT:</u></strong></p><ul><li><i><u>Frequency</u></i>: Throughout the Term</li><li><i><u>Performance Metric</u></i>: Group of 2-3 Students for Groupwork Components | Individual for Individual Components</li><li><i><u>Level of Collaboration Allowed</u></i>: <strong>Free to Discuss and Collaborate within Group | Cannot Plagiarize/Copy from Others</strong></li><li><i><u>Description</u></i>: Throughout the term, you will be asked to prepare material for a mock conference to mimic the experience of a researcher or graduate student going to present their work at a conference. Typically, this involves doing the research (in your case this would be a literature review to review different research that has been done), preparing an abstract that summarizes the work, practicing a presentation for your talk/poster, and submitting a paper for publication. Given that we need to do all this within the limitations of a course, the project will be broken up into the following components:<ul><li><strong>Milestone 1 (Group): Selection of Group and Topic</strong> | Students will be asked to pick a disease and at least 2 methods (diagnostic+ treatment for example) that can be paired well to study that disease</li><li><strong>Milestone 2 (Group): Abstract Submission</strong> | Students will be asked to submit a short paragraph and a list of references to share what they wish to base their project on after reviewing literature on reputable platforms</li><li><strong>Milestone 3 (Individual): Video Presentation</strong> | Students will be asked to prepare a 10 minute presentation to be recorded and posted on LEARN to summarize the disease they have chosen and what kinds of methods (fundamental knowledge + pros/cons) can be used to image, diagnose and/or treat the chosen disease. Peer evaluations are mandatory on Bongo / LEARN.</li><li><strong>Milestone 4 (Individual): Conference Paper Submission</strong> | Students will be asked to submit an 8-10 page (single-spaced) paper formatted according to a specific journal style (more details to be provided on LEARN) to mimic a typical manuscript submission process. The paper must provide the following information:<ul><li><i><strong>Introduction</strong></i>: a short review of the specified medical condition</li><li><i><strong>Methods</strong></i>: a discussion of how at least three medical imaging and/or biophysical technologies reviewed in this course can apply to the specific medical condition, and what diagnostic information can be obtained through the use of different imaging technologies<ul><li>Subsections must provide insight into (a) invasiveness of the procedure, (b) image quality, (c) complexity of instrumentation / methodology, and (d) cost and time considerations</li></ul></li><li><i><strong>Results</strong></i>: a summary of how some of the methods chosen have been used to study the medical condition; at least 2-3 studies must be reviewed here</li><li><i><strong>Conclusion</strong></i>: a summary of which methods are best suited to provide the most diagnostically relevant and detailed information about the medical condition</li><li><i><strong>References</strong></i>: include references to any published work</li></ul></li><li><strong>Milestone 5 (Group): Conference Poster Presentation</strong> | After having done individual research on medical conditions and imaging technologies, students will be asked to prepare a 36"x24" poster summarizing the best content out of all their group's work. Support and guidance will be provided on how to properly prepare poster presentations. <strong><u>Printing fees will be covered by Dr. Lee if and only if you submit your final poster in digital format (PDF) by the specified deadline</u></strong>. Dr. Lee will then bring the printed posters to class on the last week, where we will mount them to the walls of the classroom (or on the tables) and hold our mock conference. Peer evaluation rubrics will be provided for all students so they can walk around evaluating others' posters and ask/answer questions. <ul><li><i>Dr. Lee has secured a group discount with a local printing company that requires a minimum of 5 days lead time. <u>If you do not provide Dr. Lee with the poster files by the specified deadline, you will be responsible for printing and paying for the poster yourself as the discounted cost is only available with the bulk purchase</u>. Conference posters of this size are typically $25-50 + HST depending on the vendor and quality of paper.</i></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><i><u>Grading</u></i>: Detailed grading rubrics will be provided on LEARN for each milestone of the project</li><li><i><u>Late Penalty</u></i>: 100% for any late submissions, email for extenuating circumstances that require accommodations</li></ul><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
