  Student Assessment
</h2>
<div>There is no defined grading scheme for this course.</div>
<a></a>
<div></div>
<div>
<p><strong>ASSESSMENT:</strong></p><p>The final score will be the higher score of the following two schemes:</p><ul><li><strong>Scheme 1</strong><br/>Assignment – 10% (lowest score will be dropped)<br/>Quiz – 5%<br/>Midterm exam 1 – 20%<br/>Midterm exam 2 – 20% <br/>Final exam – 45%</li><li><strong>Scheme 2</strong><br/>Assignment – 10% (lowest score will be dropped)<br/>Quiz – 5% <br/>Higher of Midterm exam 1, Midterm exam 2 – 30%<br/>Final exam – 55%<br/><br/> </li><li>You are encouraged to collaborate with your friends, <strong>but you cannot copy assignments.</strong></li><li>You are not allowed to collaborate with/take help from anyone on tests/exams. </li><li>Weekly assignments will have 3-5 problems each, with some additional practice problems from the textbook. 1-2 problems selected by the instructor will be marked. Students will not be informed about which questions will be marked before they submit the assignments. The assignment due dates will be announced during posting.</li><li><strong>Late assignments will not be accepted</strong>. The lowest assignment score will be dropped from the final assessment. So, if you forget to submit your assignment by the deadline, or had a medical reason to skip an assignment, consider that to be your ‘free’ assignment! (If you think you have valid reasons for an exemption such as a chronic illness, contact the instructor.)</li><li><strong>Midterm exam 1 is tentatively on Feb 5, 2025, during the class time</strong> </li><li><strong>Midterm exam 2 is tentatively on Mar 10, 2025 during the class time</strong> </li><li><strong>Final exam will be scheduled by the university </strong>– details will be announced later. </li><li><strong>Missed assignments and exams – </strong>Missed<strong> </strong>exams will result in a grade of 0%.<strong> </strong>Any assignment that is not turned in on time will also receive a grade of 0%.</li><li><strong>Quizzes –</strong>  quizzes will be administered on learn. <br/>A student who misses an exam or assignment for a valid reason and submits a verification of illness (VIF) form or other similar form may be accommodated, at the sole discretion of the instructor. The grading system may be modified to accommodate the student, at the sole discretion of the instructor. Please discuss such situations with the instructor, preferably beforehand. </li><li>Check appropriate UWaterloo websites for details concerning various dates (e.g., final examination, drop deadlines)<br/><br/> </li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
