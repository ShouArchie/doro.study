Material appearing in any recorded lectures will not be assessed on the midterm or final exam. The course outline presents the instructor’s intentions for course assessments, their weights, and due dates in Winter 2025. As best as possible, we will keep to the specified assessments, weights, and dates. To provide contingency for unforeseen circumstances, the instructor reserves the right to modify course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines with due and fair notice to students. In the event of such challenges, the instructor will work with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty. </p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Important Dates for the Term:</u></strong></p><p>Here are some IMPORTANT DATES to be aware of throughout the term:</p><ul><li>Jan 6: Classes begin</li><li>Jan 17: Last day to add a class</li><li>Jan 24: Tuition and fee refund deadline - 100% | Last Day to Drop Class from Academic Record</li><li>Jan 25: Drop with WD begins</li><li>Jan 31: Final examination schedules released</li><li>Feb 14: Tuition and fee refund deadline - 50%</li><li>Feb 15-23: Reading Week (No Classes | Family Day Holiday on Feb 17)</li><li>Mar 1: Application to graduate due (for 4th year students)</li><li>Mar 21: Drop with WD ends</li><li>Mar 22: Drop with WF begins</li><li>Apr 4: Last day of classes</li><li>Apr 8: Drop with WF ends</li><li>Apr 9: Final examination period begins</li><li>Apr 25: Final examination period ends (note emergency day on Apr 13+26, Good Friday holiday on Apr 18 [no exams])</li><li>Apr 26: Grades begin to appear on Quest (not all grades will be available on this date)</li><li>May 20: Standing decisions and official grades available in Quest</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong><u>Assignments: </u></strong></p><p>Half of your grade will be based on<strong> 5 biweekly assignments that are due on Fridays at 11:59pm EST/EDT</strong>, two weeks after they are posted. </p><ul><li>All assignments must be submitted in <strong>hand-written</strong> form with complete derivations and details. No exceptions will be made. Scanned copies of your assignment may be submitted through the Dropbox on LEARN.</li><li>The lowest graded assignment will be dropped from the final mark, so you can miss one assignment without loss of grade. Other assignments contribute equally to your final grade.</li><li>In case of late submissions, a penalty of 10% per 24h past due will apply (with the late time rounded up to the nearest multiple of 24h).</li><li>Grading will be based on accuracy, quality, and clarity of solutions.</li><li>Be aware of various opportunities for bonus marks which may crop up throughout the term.</li></ul><p><strong><u>Exams:</u></strong></p><ul><li>The midterm exam will be scheduled as an in-person written exam covering all material presented in the lectures/assignments up until that point.</li><li>The end term exam will be scheduled as an in-person written exam covering all material presented in the lectures/assignments <strong>after the midterm only</strong>. It is not cumulative.</li></ul><p><strong><u>Work expected:</u></strong><u> </u></p><p>Students are expected to attend lectures, complete assigned readings, and work through the biweekly assignments. No exceptions to these requirements will generally be made in cases where students miss classes or do not complete assignments. The general workload for the course should be (on average) <strong>3.5 hours of lectures+tutorials, 2 hours of reading, and 2 hours of assignments</strong>. Students should also check the course website regularly for course announcements.</p><p><strong><u>Group Work/Discussion of Results:</u></strong><u> </u></p><p>Collaboration and/or discussion with other students are allowed on assignments. Assignments must, nonetheless be completed individually by each student, using his/her own account.</p><p><strong>Plagiarism in completing assignments is a serious offence, that can significantly affect your academic standing, and even prevent you from graduation.</strong> This includes (but is not limited to) verbatim copies of answers off the web (or off other students), without following proper citation protocols.</p><p><strong><u>Medical Exceptions:</u></strong><u> </u></p><p>Any medical exceptions must be documented by a signed medical note from a doctor or clinic, indicating the date and severity of the illness, and will only be accepted at the instructor’s discretion. Exams will not be excused for minor complaints. Students with chronic health problems should consult with the Office of Disabilities for alternate exam arrangements.</p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-other-extenuating-circumstances#submitting">Please consult the Accommodation for illness or other extenuating circumstances.</a></p><p><strong><u>Drop-dates:</u></strong><u> </u></p><p>Students concerned about the level of the course, course requirements, or their performance should keep in mind cut-off dates for dropping courses without penalty. Please check these with the undergraduate advisor or the Faculty of Science office: <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/uWaterloo-Calendar-Events-and-Academic-Deadlines">http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/uWaterloo-Calendar-Events-and-Academic-Deadlines</a></p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Inclusivity Statement</h4><p>Every student in PHYS 444 is expected to treat their peers and their instructor/TA with kindness, fairness, acceptance, and respect. In turn, your instructor/TA will treat you the same. This extends to welcoming the opinions of others and being considerate of their lived experiences.  A more welcoming and inclusive environment is created when we refrain from discussing a person’s appearance or making assumptions based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or other personal characteristics. </p><p>If you have a concern about how you or someone else is being treated, some of the people you can contact at the University of Waterloo include your instructor, <a href="mailto:psimovic@uwaterloo.ca">Fil Simovic</a>; the Associate Dean of Science for Teaching and Learning, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/chemistry/profile/ldeakin">Laura Deakin</a>; the University of Waterloo’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/conflict-management-human-rights/cmahro-resources/documenting-complaint-harassment">Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Office</a>; and the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/conflict-management-human-rights/cmahro-resources/documenting-complaint-harassment">Conflict Management &amp; Human Rights Office</a>. </p><p>If you experience or witness sexual assault or domestic violence, contact the Waterloo Region Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence Treatment Centre. A specialized team is located 24/7 at the Emergency Department of St. Mary’s General Hospital or call (519) 749-6994. If you are in immediate danger or crisis at anytime, please call 911.</p><p>If you would like to submit an inquiry or disclose an experience of discrimination based the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/page-1.html">Canadian Human Rights Act</a>, you can do so here: <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Recommendations for how to cite GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
