  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Physics Principles and Laws: By the end of the course, students will be able to construct scientifically sound explanations of a variety of basic physical phenomena by applying basic physics principles/laws. For example, regarding conservation of momentum, students will be able to:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>define linear momentum, and calculate and compare momenta of various real-life objects;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>define and calculate impulse, and establish the conditions for conservation of linear momentum; and</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>apply the laws of conservation of momentum and energy to collisions. Real-life examples will be drawn from both the physical and life sciences, in students’ own disciplines and beyond. For example, regarding conservation of momentum, students will be able to explain how a rocket works and why modern cars have crumple zones and air bags to help reduce injuries to the human body during collisions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Problem-Solving Skills and Strategies: By the end of the course, students will be able to creatively apply a variety of structured problem-solving strategies:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>interpret, visualize and convert the problem into a physical model (e.g., draw a free body diagram);</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>identify assumptions, variables, and physics principles/laws involved;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>represent these in the language of algebraic mathematics (write down the appropriate equations, combine, and solve them); and</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>evaluate the result — does it make sense? These problem-solving skills are useful in the students’ own disciplines and beyond.</td>

<h3>University of Waterloo’s Faculty of Science Academic Regulations</h3><p>For detailed information regarding academic regulations, please refer to Faculty of Science <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures"><u>Academic policies and procedures</u></a>.</p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p><strong>Inclusivity Statement</strong></p><p>Every student in Phys 111DE is expected to treat their peers and their instructor with kindness, fairness, tolerance, and respect. In turn, your instructor will treat you the same. This extends to welcoming the opinions of others and being considerate of their lived experiences.  A more welcoming and inclusive environment is created when we refrain from discussing a person’s appearance or making assumptions based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or other personal characteristics. </p><p> </p><p>If you have a concern about how you or someone else is being treated, some of the people you can contact at the University of Waterloo include your instructor, Joseph Sanderson; the Associate Dean of Science for Teaching and Learning, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/chemistry/profile/ldeakin">Laura Deakin</a>; the University of Waterloo’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/conflict-management-human-rights/cmahro-resources/documenting-complaint-harassment">Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Office</a>; and the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/conflict-management-human-rights/cmahro-resources/documenting-complaint-harassment">Conflict Management &amp; Human Rights Office</a>.  If you experience or witness sexual assault or domestic violence, contact the Waterloo Region Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence Treatment Centre. A specialized team is located 24/7 at the Emergency Department of St. Mary’s General Hospital or call (519) 749-6994. If you are in immediate danger or crisis at anytime, please call 911.</p>

<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
