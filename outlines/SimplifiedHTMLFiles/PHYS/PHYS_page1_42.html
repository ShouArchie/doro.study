Since clear skies are uncommon this time of year, <strong>please collect your data at the earliest opportunity</strong>; we will attempt to make every clear night during the term (Monday – Friday, and likely including weekends and reading week) available for observation. If the evening cloud forecast is favourable, we will announce observing sessions daily in the early afternoon on LEARN. Students may be assigned to specific days and/or allowed to sign-up for timeslots via an online poll. If you are travelling, remember that all scheduling will be in the time zone for Waterloo (<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20200317T010000&amp;p1=1203">UTC-4 or UTC-5</a> depending on Daylight Saving Time).</p><h4><strong>CONTINGENCY PLANS</strong></h4><p><strong>Student Absence:</strong> If a legitimate reason (including, for example, illness, family emergencies, COVID-19 related absence, international travel restrictions, etc.) prevents you from participating in your scheduled lab session, please contact the coordinator as soon as possible so alternative arrangements can be made (<strong>do not attend other lab sections without asking the coordinator</strong>). You may be asked to submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-other-extenuating-circumstances">relevant documentation/forms</a>. Please note that <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences">short-term self-declared absences</a> are specifically not accepted for LAB courses.</p><p>If the completion of a report was affected, please go ahead and complete the missing work as soon you are able after submitting the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-other-extenuating-circumstances">relevant documentation/forms</a> (do not wait for a response from the instructor, since this may be slow at times).</p><p>Note that midterm exams are not an acceptable reason since you will typically have many days to complete reports, however we do accept late reports (see policy in the appropriate section below). </p><p><strong>TA Absence:</strong> If a TA is unable to attend a observing session then an alternate TA or instructor will take their place. If one is not available at short notice, then the lab session may be rescheduled or offered in a different format. Please monitor your e-mail and LEARN announcements for this type of information.</p>

<h4>General Expectations:</h4><ul><li>please read the “Course Overview” document posted on LEARN for general information on preparing for your observing sessions</li></ul><h4>Collaboration Rules:</h4><ul><li>you will normally be <u>required</u> to collect data in pairs or groups of three, and you are expected to equitably participate in all aspects of doing so</li><li>unless the instructor permits otherwise, "raw" or "unreduced" data taken as part of an experiment may only be shared with students that participated in collecting it (i.e. present during the observation)</li><li>you are encouraged to <u>discuss </u>and critically <u>analyze</u> <u>ideas</u> with your colleagues in order to better understand the principles and concepts in these labs, but <strong>you may not share</strong> partially or fully completed work or your electronic files with anyone</li><li>your lab report (see next section) must reflect <strong>your own</strong> understanding, and<strong> all aspects must be completed 100% independently </strong>(<u>not</u> collaboratively)</li><li>see more below under “Academic Integrity” or feel free to ask the coordinator if you have questions</li></ul><h4>Report Format:</h4><ul><li>please write lab reports following the format in the document posted on our LEARN course hub; the Writing and Communication Centre also has resources to help you with lab report writing (information in the section below)</li><li>lab reports must be submitted as a <strong>single PDF file </strong>to the correct LEARN dropbox folder<strong> </strong>by 11:59 PM on the due date</li></ul><h4>Late Policy:</h4><ul><li>late reports will be penalized at a rate of <strong>2 marks per day</strong> out of 100 total (weekends and holidays/study days/reading week do not count)</li><li>late reports will be accepted for a maximum of 10 working days; please contact the instructor to make arrangements if your report might be later than this</li><li>if you earn a passing grade (minimum 50/100) on each report (before applying late penalties), then you will be awarded (at least) an overall course grade of 50</li><li>the final date to submit any content will be <strong>April 21st, 2025</strong></li></ul><h4>Final Experiment:</h4><ul><li>you are expected to incorporate your learnings and feedback from prior experiments in the final report</li><li>there may be some additional requirements for this experiment; further details will be announced near the end of term</li><li>this report will be due on <strong>April 21st, 2025</strong></li></ul><h4>Bonus:</h4><p>A <strong>typo bounty</strong> is up for grabs in this course! If you are the first person to spot and report a typo in any of the course material, you could be awarded a bonus to your overall course grade, perhaps from 0.5% to 2%, depending on how egregious the typo is. Report of minor typos is appreciated but will be worth less than something that could result in a real misunderstanding of some part of an experiment (you are welcome to make your case for how important the typo is). Note that a very minor grammar mistake may not result in any bonus. The value of the bonus is entirely at the instructor's discretion.</p><h4>Writing and Communication Centre:</h4><p>The Writing and Communication Centre works with students in all Faculties to help you consider your audience, clarify your ideas, develop your voice, and write in the style appropriate to your discipline.</p><p>We offer one-on-one support for writing papers, delivering presentations, integrating research, and revising for clarity and coherence. Group appointments for team-based projects, presentations, and papers are also available.</p><p><strong>All of our services are available virtually</strong>: booked appointments, drop-ins, resources, and writing groups. Check out our website for other ways to interact with us, such as open online forums and online Q&amp;As. Visit us at <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/wcc"><u>www.uwaterloo.ca/wcc</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Please note</strong> that communication specialists guide you to see your work as readers would. We can teach you revising skills and strategies, but will not change or correct your work for you. Please bring your assignment instructions and any notes or drafts to your appointment.</p>

We encourage you to seek out mental health supports when they are needed. Please reach out to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Campus Wellness and Counselling Services</a>.</p><p>We understand that these circumstances can be troubling, and you may need to speak with someone for emotional support. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/services/good2talk">Good2Talk</a> is a post-secondary student helpline based in Ontario, Canada that is available to all students.</p><p><strong>Course Statement on Equity and Inclusion</strong>: Every student in PHYS 370L is expected to treat their peers and their instructor with kindness, fairness, tolerance, and respect. In turn, your instructor will treat you the same. This extends to welcoming the opinions of others and being considerate of their lived experiences.  A more welcoming and inclusive environment is created when we refrain from discussing a person’s appearance or making assumptions based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or other personal characteristics. </p><p>If you have a concern about how you or someone else is being treated, some of the people you can contact at the University of Waterloo include your instructor, <a href="mailto:victor.arora@uwaterloo.ca">Victor Arora</a>; the Associate Dean of Science for Teaching and Learning, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/chemistry/profile/ldeakin">Laura Deakin</a>; the University of Waterloo’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/conflict-management-human-rights/cmahro-resources/documenting-complaint-harassment">Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Office</a>; and the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/conflict-management-human-rights/cmahro-resources/documenting-complaint-harassment">Conflict Management &amp; Human Rights Office</a>. If you experience or witness sexual assault or domestic violence, contact the Waterloo Region Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence Treatment Centre. A specialized team is located 24/7 at the Emergency Department of St. Mary’s General Hospital or call (519) 749-6994.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as <strong>[fill this in with your discipline-specific skills]</strong>. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
