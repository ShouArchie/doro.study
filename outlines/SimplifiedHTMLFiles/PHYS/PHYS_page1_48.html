<p><strong>Evaluation: </strong>The course grade will be based on 5 assignments, one written report, 2 in-class tests and a final examination, which will be held during the Official Examination Schedule. </p><p> </p><p> Dates of term in-class tests are Feb. 8, 2025, Mar. 13, 2025</p><p>*note: if either midterm is missed due to  48hour absence then the final exam will be worth 55% of the final grade.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignments: </strong>The 5 assignments will be assigned every other week and will cover the lecture topic covered in those two weeks.</p><p><strong>Rules for Group Work in Assignments: </strong>Students can work in groups, but each student needs to submit his/her own version of the working and results.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment Deadline:</strong> Assignments are to be handed in to the instructor during the Friday class of that week. </p><p><strong>Late Submissions:</strong> If the TA has not completed marking, late assignments will be accepted. Assignments cannot be handed in after the solutions are posted which will typically happen the following week.</p><p><strong>Pick up Marked Assignments: </strong>Marked assignments will be picked up in class</p><p> </p><p><strong>Written Report:</strong> The report will be your opportunity to display your understanding of laser properties as they relate to a common application.  In your report, you must describe which laser characteristics are needed for the application and why that particular type of laser can deliver the needed laser specifications. The topics to choose from are:</p><p> </p><ol><li>Excimer lasers are being used for lithography, but now there is an interest in using them for laser fusion.  At least 2 US companies have formed recently to develop excimer lasers for fusion even though Los Alamos National Lab shut down their excimer laser fusion development project years ago.  Why is there now great interest in excimers for laser fusion?</li><li>Why are Er doped fiber amplifiers used in fiber optics communications?</li><li>Google data centers can have a million lasers working in them. What kind of laser and why?</li></ol><p> </p><p>The reports will be marked by the instructor.  As this report is worth as much as the 5 assignments, it is expected that you will be working on this report during the weeks without assignments.  For the report you will be asked to </p><p> </p><ol><li>choose the topic by Jan. 16, 2025 (5% of report grade)</li><li>have the three main points and the 5 references (not websites) that you are using by Feb13, 2025 (35% of report grade)</li><li>Hand in the 5-page report by March 20, 2025 (60% of report grade)</li></ol><p> </p><p> </p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
