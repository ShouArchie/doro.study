  Instructor &amp; TA (Teaching Assistant) Information
</h2>
<div>
<p>The course instructor, Mike Allen, is located in B1-381 and office hours are by appointment (contact by email: mike.allen@uwaterloo.ca).</p><p>Your laboratory Teaching Assistants are available to assist you during the laboratory sessions. Please be aware that TAs will try to respond in a timely manner outside your lab session but are not expected to respond immediately to emails outside “normal work hours”.  Be prepared to wait until the next working day (if it’s late at night, or during a weekend or holiday) before you should reasonably expect a response. As TAs are students as well (whether graduate or undergraduate) they too will have classes and scheduled events that will limit their availability – both to be immediately responsive to your requests, or to meet with you outside normal lab hours. Your patience and understanding is appreciated. TA office hours/locations will be arranged by individual TAs.</p><p> </p><p>Biol 373L TAs Winter 2025</p><p>Section 1-Monday Afternoon-230pm-520pm</p><p>                Dejana Mitrovic                             <a href="mailto:dejana.mitrovic@uwaterloo.ca">dejana.mitrovic@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><p>                Mohammad Moradi                      <a href="mailto:m5moradi@uwaterloo.ca">m5moradi@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><p>Section 2- Monday Evening-630pm-920pm</p><p>                Magalie Galarneau                         <a href="mailto:mgalarne@uwaterloo.ca">mgalarne@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><p>                Victoria Pepe                                  <a href="mailto:vapepe@uwaterloo.ca">vapepe@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><p>Section 3-Tuesday Afternoon-230pm-520pm</p><p>                Magalie Galarneau                         <a href="mailto:mgalarne@uwaterloo.ca">mgalarne@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><p>                Ryan Leys                                       <a href="mailto:rleys@uwaterloo.ca">rleys@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><p>Section 4-Tuesday Evening-630pm-920pm</p><p>               TBA</p><p>                Lauren Weeks                                <a href="mailto:l2weeks@uwaterloo.ca">l2weeks@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><p>Section 5-Wednesday Afternoon-230pm-520pm</p><p>                Victoria Pepe                                 <a href="mailto:vapepe@uwaterloo.ca">vapepe@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><p>                Lauren Weeks                                <a href="mailto:l2weeks@uwaterloo.ca">l2weeks@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><p>Section 6- Wednesday Evening-630pm-920pm</p><p>                Ryan Leys                                       <a href="mailto:rleys@uwaterloo.ca">rleys@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><p>                Ally Miners                                     <a href="mailto:adminers@uwaterloo.ca">adminers@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><p>Section 7-Thursday Afternoon-230pm-520pm</p><p>                Jessica Anantharajah                      <a href="mailto:jsananth@uwaterloo.ca">jsananth@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><p>                Ally Miners                                     <a href="mailto:adminers@uwaterloo.ca">adminers@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><p>Section 8-Thursday Evening-630pm-920pm</p><p>                Dejana Mitrovic                             <a href="mailto:dejana.mitrovic@uwaterloo.ca">dejana.mitrovic@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><p>                Mohammad Moradi                      <a href="mailto:m5moradi@uwaterloo.ca">m5moradi@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><p> </p>

<p><strong>Laboratory Reports </strong></p><p>During the term you will submit laboratory reports on three of the exercises. The standard format for laboratory reports in Biology courses is found at the end of this manual (see page 103). <strong>Lab reports are due in the Dropbox BEFORE the start of your lab period</strong>. Any reports handed in after the lab has begun will be considered late = 5% per day (max 3 days). The marking scheme for reports can be found at the end of the lab manual (see page 107).</p><p>No student can receive credit for a report on a laboratory exercise that they did not perform. That means that <strong>students MUST attend a lab exercise if they expect to write a lab report for that exercise</strong>. If you were not present at an exercise assigned by your TA for a lab report, you will be required to write a report on an exercise you DID attend instead. </p><p><strong>For a description of your responsibilities in preparing written reports and the rules concerning academic misconduct, please see p. 108: Regulations for Academic Discipline. </strong></p><p><strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) will be used to screen assignments in this course</strong>. This is being done to verify that use of all materials and sources in assignments is documented. Students will be given an option if they do not want to have their assignment screened by Turnitin®. In the first week of the term, details will be provided on the UW LEARN Website about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin® in this course. </p><p><strong>There will be TWO Turnitin® Dropboxes: a DRAFT Dropbox and a FINAL SUBMISSION Dropbox</strong> for each of the lab reports required in this course. Lab reports can be submitted for a draft review for Turnitin®<strong> </strong>in the DRAFT Dropbox. Students can submit a <strong>single draft</strong> for review that will <strong>NOT</strong> be marked, are not examined by TAs or the Instructor for assessment, and do not become part of the review database. Any issues highlighted are for the student to correct BEFORE submission. </p><p><strong>Students will need to submit their final draft SEPARATELY</strong>. Submitting to the DRAFT Dropbox DOES NOT mean you have handed in the assignment – ONLY reports in the Final Submission Dropbox will be considered as “handed in” to meet report deadlines. Students are NOT required to hand in a printed copy of their reports (see MARK DISTRIBUTION above for due dates). </p><p>Students can find a separate document on the UW LEARN site in the <strong>Course Information</strong> folder with detailed instructions for using the DRAFT and FINAL SUBMISSION Dropboxes, and how to interpret the matching report generated by the Turnitin®<strong> </strong>software. </p><p><strong>Attendance At Your Laboratory Session </strong></p><p>Only medical certificates of incapacitation (requiring a Verification of Illness – VIF) or dire emergencies are accepted excuses for absence from your laboratory period. <strong>If you foresee circumstances ahead of time that will make it impossible for you to attend your normal laboratory period </strong>(such as job interviews or participation in athletic events),<strong> please make arrangements with Mike Allen, B1-381 (mike.allen@uwaterloo.ca) as soon as possible to attend another</strong> <strong>lab section that week</strong>. Because of the severe demands of time, space and equipment, switching to another section may not always be possible. Please note that laboratory exercises CANNOT be “reset” to any other day or time other than those originally scheduled. </p><p><strong>Students who miss THREE or more labs</strong> (with or without documentation) have missed more than 30% of the Lab sessions <strong>will receive an INC and will not be allowed to write the Lab Final Exam</strong>. </p><p>Also, <strong>students who</strong> <strong>do not hand in at least TWO of the three required lab reports</strong> (with or without documentation) have failed to complete the minimum 65% of the graded material (written assignments) and <strong>will receive an INC and will not be allowed to write the</strong> <strong>Lab Final Exam</strong> </p><p>If EITHER situation above occurs, students will be <strong>assigned a grade of INC</strong>, and be required to <strong>complete any missed lab sessions (and/or lab reports) the next time the course is offered</strong> and will also <strong>write the Lab Final Exam</strong> in that same subsequent term. Currently this lab course is offered in the Winter term every year, and in the Spring term as needed. </p><p><strong>For more information on missing lab sessions, report deadlines, or exams, and how to obtain a VIF, see p. 110: Missed Labs, Assignments or Examinations. </strong></p><p><strong>Biology 373 Lecture Withdrawal</strong></p><p>If you are taking Biology 373L (lab) in the same term as Biology 373 (lecture), and circumstances require you to withdraw from the lecture course (Biol 373) you will also need to withdraw from the lab course (Biol 373L) regardless of how many labs have been completed, since the lecture is a pre-requisite or co-requisite of the lab course. </p><p><strong>Biology 273L or Biol 373L from previous terms (prior to Fall 2021). </strong></p><p>Students who have previously completed Biol 273L or Biol 373L (Winter 2021 term or earlier) are not eligible for the current offering of Biol 373L since these lab courses are <strong>anti-requisites</strong>.  The current version of Biol 373L is only open to students who have previously successfully completed Biol 273 (lecture) and have previously completed or are currently enrolled in Biol 373 (lecture).</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
</p>

<h2>
  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>Activities for this course may involve recording, in partial fulfillment of the course learning outcomes.  You will receive notification of recording via at least one of the following mechanisms: within the Learning Management System (LEARN), a message from your course instructor, course syllabus/website, or other means.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as working in a lab and writing lab reports. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
