<p><strong>Readings:</strong> Based on the papers that students choose to select for their Student Presentations, journal articles/reviews will be posted to the Course UW-Learn webpage a week prior to class. All students are expected to read these articles and come to class prepared to discuss the articles/techniques/findings/provide critiques/suggest future experiments.</p>

<p><strong>Guidelines for research presentations</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Paper selection: </strong>Students should choose papers that have been published in the last 5 years. Papers should have 4-7 figures and contain at least 3 or 4 different techniques. As the term progresses, students should aim to select papers with different topics and techniques from those papers previously presented. </li><li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Should include an introduction to the topic, a methods section in which the presenter should describe the methods as well as their strengths and limitations (only if methods have not been previously covered), present the results from the paper and a summary of the major findings of the paper. Students should also be able to describe one or two future experiments (and the methods that would be used) that could extend the study.</li><li><strong>Participation:</strong> All students are expected to bring questions/discussion about the methods used, their limitations, strengths and alternative methods that could have been used to address the same questions. Students should be able to interpret figures and determine if all the proper controls are in place, whether the authors have interpreted the results or if there are alternative interpretations, whether the results support the conclusions/findings presented in the discussion. Students should also generate ideas for future studies that could extend the paper being presented.</li></ol><p> </p><p><strong>Guidelines for literature review paper</strong></p><ol><li>Maximum of 10 double spaced pages (not including references), 2.5 cm margins (sides, top, bottom) in Times New Roman, 12 pt font.</li><li>Should include a title, name of student, abstract, introduction, body sections (however many are needed), and conclusions section which identifies the impact of the research, current knowledge gaps and future directions in the field. </li><li>References can be in any style, however they must be consistent. </li></ol><p> </p><p><strong>Guidelines for NSERC grant </strong></p><ol><li>The topic of the NSERC grant will be based off of the paper selected for the research presentation.</li><li>Students should refer to the sample NSERC grant provided on the course UW Learn webpage as a guide during preparation of their grant.</li><li><strong>NSERC grant:</strong> should be a maximum of 5 single spaced pages (not including references), with 2.5 cm margins (sides, top, bottom) in Times New Roman, 12 pt font. The sections of the grant should include background, objectives, hypothesis, specific aims, a description of these aims, and an impact of research section. Figures are encouraged! Depending on the approach students take, it may be appropriate to include a progress report section. References can be in any style, however the format must be consistent. No budget or budget justification is needed. </li></ol><p> </p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
