<p><strong>Mini Quizzes</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>Students will learn to synthesize major themes from lecture by answering a multiple choice question at the conclusion of each lecture using the course LEARN page (Note quizzes will only be available in lecture time, no exceptions). Quizzes will not be graded for correctness, but students will receive a participation grade (out of 10) based on their participation in quizzes. Participation grades will be assigned based on the proportion of questions answered such that each quiz will be worth 0.5 of the final grade. Students must complete 18 of the 21 quizzes to receive 10 out of 10 for the participation grade. Quiz questions will be reviewed at the beginning of the following lecture.</p><p><strong>Fact Sheet Assignments</strong></p><p>Student will self-organize to work in teams of three to complete two, one-page fact sheets over the course of the term. Students must enrol in a group at least 2 weeks prior to the assignment due date. <strong>Failing to enrol in a group by the specified dates</strong> (Fact Sheet #1: Jan. 16, 2025, 11:59 pm; Fact Sheet #2: Feb. 20, 2025, 11:59 pm) <strong>will result in a grade of 0</strong>. The first fact sheet will describe the characteristics (e.g., habitat, life history, threats, protection strategies) of an aquatic species-at-risk in Ontario, Canada. The second fact sheet will describe the characteristics (e.g., habitat, life history, impact, control strategies) of an exotic aquatic species in Ontario, Canada. Fact sheets will be graded based on content, adherence to formatting guidelines and aesthetics. Please refer to Fact Sheet assignment description on the course Learn page for full details and the grading rubric.</p><p><strong>Term Tests and Final Exams</strong></p><p>There will be two term tests and one final examination. The term tests (80 minutes) will occur in class. The final examination (2 hours) will be scheduled during the examination period at the end of the winter term and will be in person. The midterm and final examinations cover material from lectures and the assigned readings. Tests and exams will be multiple choice format. Each test will cover all course material preceding the test/exam, but will emphasize course materials not previously tested.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>COURSE POLICIES:</strong></p><p><strong>Late Policy</strong></p><p>Late submissions will be penalized at a rate of 10% per day for the first seven days. A mark of 0%‐mark will be recorded if work is submitted more than a week late. Assignments must be submitted before the deadline to not receive the late penalty, no exceptions (i.e., an assignment received 1 minute after the deadline is still one day late).<strong> </strong><i><u>It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that uploads to the course LEARN page are successful.</u></i></p><p><strong>Extensions</strong></p><p>If you are unable to submit an assignment on time, you may submit a written request for extension, clearly outlining why you should be granted an extension. This request must be submitted to the course instructor at least 2 days before the assignment is due. </p><p><strong>Generative Artificial Intelligence Usage</strong></p><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as [fill this in with your discipline-specific skills]. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of Policy 71 (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (ICAI, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><p>   Student Success Office for help with skills like notetaking and time management</p><p>   Writing and Communication Centre for assignments with writing or presentations</p><p>   AccessAbility Services for documented accommodations</p><p>   Library for research-based assignments<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Public Health Restrictions</strong></p><p>Should Public Health and the institution determine that in-person teaching is no longer possible, please refer immediately to the class page on Learn. Should the university require that lectures be moved to remote delivery, BIOL 351 will have asynchronous lectures posted to LEARN and scheduled assessments will be provided remotely via LEARN. Even if classes remain in person, students and instructors may not be able access the classrooms if they are feeling ill. In these situations, students are encouraged to reach out to the instructor for assistance. Should the instructor not be able to attend, the students will receive an email that morning and the lecture will be provided remotely via LEARN. </p><p><strong>Accommodation</strong></p><p>For University of Waterloo Policy on Accommodation for Medical Illness and a downloadable Verification of Illness form see:</p><p><a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations</a></p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic</a></p><p>Students seeking academic accommodation on medical grounds for any missed tests, exams, participation components and/or assignments worth 10% or more of their final grade must complete a verification of illness form to support requests for accommodation related to medical grounds.</p><p>If students are granted an accommodation for a test, the weighting of the missed test is added to the final examination weighting or spread over the remaining tests. </p><p>For assignments worth less than 10% no medical documentation is required, but you must contact the instructor before the assignment due date, or as soon as possible afterwards, to notify them of the medical absence and for arranging academic accommodation.</p><p>Students seeking accommodations due to religious observances should consult with the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought.</p>
