<p>Dr. Liam McGuire, Associate Professor, Department of Biology</p><p>As you will very quickly learn, I think a lot of animals are really neat. In my own research I'm particularly interested in the ecological energetics of bats and birds...mostly bats. By the end of the semester you will definitely know a lot more about bats than you do now!

<div>
<div>
<div>BIOL 371:</div>
<p>A comparative study of neural, sensory, endocrine, digestive, and reproductive strategies across animal taxa. The emphasis will be on evolutionary themes at the organismal, cellular, and molecular levels.</p>

<div>
<p>Put simply, this course asks the basic question: "How do animals work?" More specifically, we will use a comparative approach to consider how different kinds of animals work. In what ways is physiology similar across a wide range of animals? What are key differences among different types of animals? Asking these questions will also help us develop an appreciation for the evolution of various physiological processes. Some physiological aspects are common across many animals, whereas others may reveal patterns among organisms of increasing complexity. We can't cover all aspects of animal physiology in a single semester, and will focus on neurophysiology, sensory processes, endocrinology, feeding and digestion, and reproduction. Other aspects of animal physiology were covered in BIOL 370. Although the two courses are clearly related, you don't have to have taken BIOL 370 to be successful in BIOL 371.</p><p>A major objective of the course is to develop an appreciation of biodiversity. There is a fascinating diversity of animals out there, and I will make a point of incorporating many different types of animals, some familiar, but hopefully some you haven't heard of before. </p><p>So there you have it, three key questions summarize the framework of the course:</p><p><i>1) How do animals work?</i></p><p><i>2) How are things similar or different among a diverse range of animals?</i></p><p><i>3) What are some of the evolutionary considerations among these various physiological processes?</i></p>

<h4><strong>Strongly Recommended</strong></h4><p><i>Hill RW, GA Wyse, and M Anderson. 2022. Animal Physiology, 5th Edition. Sinauer Associates, Inc. Sunderland, Massachusetts.</i></p><p>There are several formats of the textbook available through the bookstore and other outlets. Notably, there is an e-book version available to rent from <a href="https://www.vitalsource.com/en-ca/products/animal-physiology-richard-hill-v9780197553619">https://www.vitalsource.com/en-ca/products/animal-physiology-richard-hill-v9780197553619</a>. Note that this is the same textbook used for BIOL370, so some students may already have a copy, or if you decide to take 370 later you will already have the book. </p><p><strong>The textbook is also available at the library through the course reserves, including 3 chapters that will be made available electronically</strong>. Even if you decide not to purchase the textbook, I recommend stopping by the library occasionally to look over any aspects of lectures that you might need a bit more detail.</p><p>All material necessary for assessments will be included in lecture materials, but I strongly recommend students get a copy of the textbook. My approach for the course is to build from the textbook and supplement that material with other sources. However, the basic concepts are all covered in the book and students often find it valuable to read the more detailed explanations in the book, or simply to see the material presented in a slightly different manner.</p><p><i><strong>A note on textbook edition</strong>: </i>The 5th edition is the current edition of the textbook, and that is officially the version of the book to be used for BIOL371 this semester. However, I suspect you would do just fine if you could get your hands on a more affordable used copy of the 4th edition. I haven't conducted an exhaustive search, but I did some random checks and every figure I looked for in the 4th edition was also in the 5th edition, just off by a few pages.</p>

<h3><strong>Quizzes</strong></h3><p>There will be a short weekly quiz. The quizzes are helpful to ensure you grasped key concepts from lecture material, but the also encourage you to go back over your notes and study regularly throughout the semester. In previous semesters I have received <strong>overwhelming feedback from students </strong>indicating that weekly quizzes were very helpful in being prepared for exams. I will include reminders about weekly quizzes in an announcement to start each week. </p><p>I recognize that students have many other commitments and obligations beyond this course, and unexpected things pop up unexpectedly. To allow for life getting in the way, I will <strong>drop the lowest quiz grade</strong> (9 quizzes total, best 8 count). If you are sick, busy, or simply forgetful, this will allow you to skip a quiz without penalty. If you are in the unfortunate circumstance of missing more than one quiz/assignment proper documentation will be required.</p><h3><strong>Poster Presentation</strong></h3><p>Working in small groups (typically 2 - 3 students, depending on enrollment), you will choose a peer-reviewed scientific publication and present the paper in a poster session format. Poster sessions are a common and standard method for researchers to present their work to their peers at scientific conferences. You will play the role of the authors of the paper, and present the paper as if you were presenting the poster at a scientific conference. The challenge with poster presentations is extracting the core components of the study and presenting them in a clear and concise manner. Interested researchers will read the full publication for all the details, the value of the poster is quickly communicating the exciting findings and the important implications of the work to a broad audience. This assessment will peel back the curtain to reveal some aspects of the scientific research community, and will also be an exercise in integrating and synthesizing knowledge from lectures to communicate the research to a broad audience. </p><p>Note that students are responsible for having their poster printed for the poster presentation. Posters can be printed by the WStore or other printing outlets. Cost is typically ~$50 - $60. Only one copy of the poster needs to be printed for the group, so the cost per individual student is minimal.</p><h3><strong>Exams</strong></h3><p>There will be 4 exams throughout the semester- three during the semester and the fourth during the final exam period. Each exam is weighted equally and will primarily cover the material covered since the previous exam. However, exams are pseudo-cumulative. Pseudo-cumulative means the exams aren't cumulative in the sense that each successive exam covers all content since the beginning of the course. However, while each exam is primarily focused on material since the previous exam, there may be a small number of questions related to core concepts and major important ideas from throughout the course. In other words, a major concept from week two may appear on the final exam, but questions about specific details will not be included cumulatively. My perspective on the cumulative aspects of the course is that there are certain 'big ideas' or 'core concepts' that I need to know and be aware of to be a successful and productive researcher, and then there are lots of specific details that I know are on a book on my shelf or just a quick internet search away. The cumulative aspects of the course are the concepts that you need to know, so that you know what to search for when looking up the specific details.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) may be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.
