You will not have access to this course once the next term begins.</p><h2><strong>LECTURE TOPICS </strong></h2><p>Corresponding Silverthorn textbook chapters in parentheses for each unit. It is recommended that students read the textbook material either before or shortly after lectures. </p><p><strong>Unit 1 – Introduction to Physiology </strong><i><strong>(Chapters 1, 3 &amp; 6 in Silverthorn)</strong></i></p><p>This unit serves as an introduction to the study of the function of the five organ systems examined in this course (nervous, muscular, cardiovascular, respiratory, and immune). The structure and function of cells and tissues will be explored along with cell-to-cell communication. Unit 1 will introduce how the organ systems work together to maintain homeostasis within the body. </p><p><strong>Unit 2 – Neurophysiology </strong><i><strong>(Chapters 8 &amp; 11 in Silverthorn)</strong></i></p><p>The organization of the nervous system will be explored in this unit. The types of cells found in the central and peripheral nervous system serve as a starting point to discuss their function within the nervous system. The electrical properties of neurons will be examined in graded and action potentials. The efferent branch of the peripheral nervous system will be studied in detail. </p><p><strong>Unit 3 – Muscle </strong><i><strong>(Chapter 12 in Silverthorn)</strong></i></p><p>Initially gross structure of skeletal muscle including the structure of a muscle fibre and myofibrils will be examined. An exploration into the muscle contraction mechanism via excitation-contraction coupling will be examined to explain how muscles work. The role of ATP in cooperation with specialized muscle fibres will be examined. The unit will end with a discussion on smooth muscle and an introduction to cardiac muscle. </p><p><strong>Unit 4 – Cardiovascular system (</strong><i><strong>Chapters 14, 15 &amp; 16)</strong></i></p><p>This unit will start with an introduction into the heart and components of the cardiovascular system, which will be followed by cardiac muscle contraction mechanism. The cardiac cycle will be studied including electrocardiograms (ECG) that allows for the visualization of the electrical activity of the heart. The properties of blood vessels and the homeostatic controls that regulate blood flow and blood pressure will be studied. Lastly, the components of blood, blood cell production (haematopoiesis), and the formation of blood clots after injury (haemostasis) will be examined.</p><p><strong>Unit 5 – Respiratory system </strong><i><strong>(Chapters 17 &amp; 18)</strong></i></p><p>In this unit we will examine the structure and function of the respiratory system, incorporating gas laws and ventilation. Pulmonary function through lung compliance and elastance as well as the control of ventilation will be examined. Lastly, gas exchange in the lungs and the transport of gases in the blood will be discussed.</p><p><strong>Unit 6 – Immune System </strong><i><strong>(Chapter 24)</strong></i></p><p>This unit will start with the general function of immune system and introduction to the types of pathogens that infect the body. The anatomy of the immune system will be discussed returning to the role of haematopoiesis. The types of immunity, innate and adaptive, will be studied through an examination of response pathways.</p>

<h2><strong>Term Test 1 and 2</strong></h2><p>The format for <u>all</u> term tests will be multiple choice questions. The term tests take place in the lecture room during class time according to the course schedule. Each exam is cumulative. Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/"><u>Quest</u></a> to make sure you know the section you should write in.</p><h2><strong>Final Exam</strong></h2><p>The format for cumulative final exam will be multiple choice questions. The final exam date, time, and location will be announced on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations"><u>UW Final Exam Schedule</u></a> website and on the BIOL 273 LEARN site. </p><p><strong>Do not book travel until you know your final exam schedule.</strong></p><h2><strong>Missed Exam or Assignment Policy</strong></h2><p>The format for the course assessments can be found on Learn. If you miss an assessment, you will receive a grade of zero (0). If the assessment was missed due to illness or another valid, documentable reason, you <u>may</u> be granted accommodation through the following process:</p><ol><li>Contact your section instructor indicate Section 001 (Dr. Vivian Dayeh) or Section. 002 (Dr. Michael Bording-Jorgensen) in the subject line  (<a href="biol273@uwaterloo.ca">biol273@uwaterloo.ca</a>) within 24 hours of the missed assessment. Emails can be received 24 hours per day.</li><li>Follow the information posted in the Faculty of Science Accommodation for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances website (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances</a>)</li></ol><p>A missed Mastering A&amp;P assignment, due to illness, must be completed by the deadline agreed upon in accordance with the accommodation period. In the event that you miss a term test due to illness, the weight of the missed exam will be transferred to the final. <i>Student travel plans are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time</i> (see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations">https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations</a>). Retroactive documentation will not be accepted.</p><p><strong>Note that filing documentation with the Science Undergrad office/Quest does NOT automatically excuse the missing of a test/assignment.</strong> The course instructor will consider the information provided on the documentation when deciding whether a student should be excused. Students should carefully consider the wisdom of missing a test or assignment.</p><h2>Late Policy</h2><p>Mastering A&amp;P assignments handed in late will receive a deduction of 5%/day for the first five late days after which a grade of zero (0) will be recorded. </p>

  Administrative Policy

<div>
<h2>Territorial Acknowledgement</h2><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><h2>End of Term "Grade Shopping" </h2><p>Please do not plead for an extra few marks from your course instructor either in person or by email. Some examples include: “I’m 1% away from the Dean’s Honours list” or “I got 88 in your course, but my med school application would look better if you gave me 90”. <strong><u>Don’t waste your time with these requests!</u></strong> Arbitrarily increasing your grade is blatantly unfair to the rest of the class. Your message will be deleted and you will not receive a response.</p><h2>Expectations for Change</h2><p>Decisions may need to be taken that will directly affect material covered, the number and weight of the assignments and exams required, and the distribution of grades among completed and uncompleted components of the course. The university and lecturers will make every effort to keep to this course outline, but students need to be aware that all these factors may be subject to change if and when conditions change.</p><h2>Generative AI</h2><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as multiple choice question creation. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
