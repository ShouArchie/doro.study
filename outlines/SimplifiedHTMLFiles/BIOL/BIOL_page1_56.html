  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>BIOL 484:</div>
<p>The role of classical genetic analysis in the context of today's genomic era. Topics discussed in lectures and labs include meiotic recombination, meiosis, complementation analysis, chromosome aberrations, and genetic interactions. Methods used in model eukaryotic genetic organisms such as forward and reverse genetic screens, genetic mosaics, conditional mutants, and genetic mapping will be discussed. Examples will illustrate how genes continue to be identified using classical-based approaches in a variety of biological processes, including cell cycle progression, cancer and metastasis, learning and memory, as well as pattern formation and embryonic development. Alternatives to traditional mutagenesis-based screens and the links between classical and molecular genetics will also be discussed.</p>

<p>Advanced Eukaryotic Genetics is designed to introduce students to the world of <strong>genetic research</strong>, with particular emphasis on the attributes and use of <strong>model genetic organisms</strong> (the yeasts, <i>Neurospora</i>, <i>Drosophila</i>, <i>C. elegans</i>, Zebrafish, <i>Arabidopsis</i>) in basic research.  This course also strives to introduce students to some advanced concepts in classical genetics and to relate how classical genetics is relevant in today’s era of genome sequencing, genomics, proteomics, and genome editing.</p><p>The course is delivered using PowerPoint lecture presentations that will be available before lectures. Tutorial sessions are used to go through example problems, to review material before midterm exams, and to allow for demonstrations of literature and database searches. Tutorials sessions may also be used as lectures if we fall behind schedule wrt the lecture material.</p><p> </p><p>For every hour of lecture time you can expect to spend one hour reviewing and reading supplementary information (most will be provided on the LEARN site). </p><p>The problem assignments (there will be two) are generally considered tricky.  Each problem set will probably take about six hours to complete as you may be required to do some additional background reading to figure out how to approach the problems.  Many genetic problems are like puzzles and they will take some time to solve.  Do not leave them until the night before they are due – you will have over one week to work out each problem set.</p><p> </p><p><strong>LECTURE MATERIAL:</strong></p><p><strong>1) Introduction &amp; Review of 239 Material:</strong></p><p>Prokaryotes vs. eukaryotes, Mendel’s Rules (two main laws), the dihybrib cross, the concept of genetic linkage, the stages of meiosis and the main events of meiosis, the chromosome theory of inheritance and its proof, recombination mapping (genetic distances), genetic maps vs. physical maps, polytene chromosomes.</p><p><strong>2) Concepts for Genetic Analysis:</strong></p><p>Model genetic organisms (general attributes and characteristics), balancer chromosomes and “balanced” genetic stocks, pericentric and paracentric inversions, methods of inducing genetic mutations, heterochromatin, RNAi, the genetic engineering and use of transposons as genetic tools </p><p><strong>3) Details of </strong><i><strong>Drosophila</strong></i><strong> as a <u>m</u>odel <u>g</u>enetic <u>o</u>rganism (MGO)</strong></p><p><strong>4) Details of </strong><i><strong>C. elegans</strong></i><strong> as an MGO.</strong></p><p><strong>5) Details of yeast as an MGO.</strong></p><p><strong>6) Details of </strong><i><strong>Arabidopsis</strong></i><strong> as an MGO.</strong></p><p><strong>7) Advanced Genetic Mapping:</strong></p><p>Tetrad Analysis in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, Perkin’s Equation, Centromere Linkage in Ordered and Unordered Tetrads, Half Tetrad Analysis, crossover interference, sister chromatid exchange.</p><p><strong>8) non-Mendelian Inheritance</strong></p><p><strong>9) Genetic Complementation</strong></p><p>Knowing how the complementation test can fool you, genetic modifiers, examples of genetic screens using MGOs, epistasis </p><p><strong>10) Genetic Mosaics</strong></p><p><strong>11) CRISPR/Cas9 –– </strong>implications for model genetic systems and efficacy for gene therapy, and “genome editing”<strong> </strong></p><p> </p>

Lectures and tutorials will not be recorded.  </p>

<p><i><strong>Assignment 3:</strong> will most likely involve researching and describing a “gene of interest” as it relates to a particular biological process.

DATE – TBA (will be during final exam session organized by the Registrar's Office.</p><p> </p><p><i>THERE WILL BE NO MAKE-UP MIDTERM EXAM FOR ANY REASON.  IF YOU MISS THE MID-TERM FOR ANY REASON, THE VALUE OF THE MID-TERM WILL BE ADDED TO YOUR FINAL EXAM. <u>Essentially, this means that the midterm is optional.  But I highly recommend that you write the midterm.  Since the midterm is optional, the final will be comprehensive, and to be fair everyone’s marks will be calculated with and without the midterm and you will be awarded the higher of the two values.</u></i></p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
