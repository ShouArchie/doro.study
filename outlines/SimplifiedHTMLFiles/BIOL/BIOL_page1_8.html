  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>The course is organized into three modules. At the end of each module, students knowledge will be assessed with a term test.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Module 1</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Plant Evolution: Structure and Reproduction</strong></p><p>This module will follow the evolution of single-celled heterotrophic prokaryotes to autotrophic eukaryote plants. Focus will be applied to the adaptive strategies employed by algae to move from water to land, the development of complex tissues and organs and the role of reproduction strategies in plant success. Lecture material covered in this module will be assessed in Term Test 1 (Jan 29th).</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Module 2</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Plant Growth and Development: Tissues, Transport and Metabolites </strong></p><p>This module will focus on the primary and secondary development of 1) dermal, 2) ground and 3) vascular plant tissues. Cellular composition of plant tissues and what role they play in their function will be studied; with particular interest in the relationship between vascular tissue and water transport. Role of plant tissues and their metabolites in plant defence against biotic stressors will also be studied. Lecture material covered in this module will be assessed in Term Test 2 (Mar 5th).</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Module 3</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Plants and Their Environment: Photosynthetic Pathways and Hormone Interactions</strong></p><p>This module will focus on how plants have adapted to interact with their environment. In addition to learning the process of photosynthesis, students will learn about C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>4 </sub>and CAM photosynthetic pathways and how they allow plants to thrive under adverse growing conditions. Additionally, students will study how hormones and growth regulators regulate plant development, tropic movement and plant response to biotic and abiotic stressors, as well as learn of their many uses in agriculture. Lecture material covered in this module will be assessed in Term Test 3 (Apr 2nd).</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p> </p><p>Laboratory exercises will compliment the weekly topics covered in lectures.

<p><strong>Term Tests: </strong>The format for the term tests will be a) multiple choice, b) labelling/fill in the blank and c) short answer questions. The term tests are NOT cumulative, each will test one module (three modules total). Term Test 1 will include information from Lectures 1-7. Term Test 2 will include information from Lectures 8-14. Term Test 3 will include material from Lectures 15-21. If a student completes all three term tests, the lowest test score will be dropped and the final grade calculated with the two highest scoring tests. </p><p><strong>Policy for Missed Term Tests: </strong>You have the following three options for declaring an absence, in all three cases, you are expected to notify the  course instructor before or within 24 hour of the missed term test, failure to do so can result in an INC and zero (0) grade for missed test:</p><ol><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences#covid-19-related-absence"><strong>Short-term Absence</strong></a>: you can self-declare, through Quest, an absence for 48 hours or less, during the Formal Lecture Period; a short-term absence can be self-declared for any reason that prevents a student from meeting their academic obligations; students are permitted only one self-declared short-term absence accommodation per academic term, no documentation is required. This DOES NOT apply to labs.</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences#covid-19-related-absence"><strong>Covid-19 Related Absence</strong></a>: students can self-declare, through Quest, an absence for 10 days or less if they test positive for Covid-19 or related symptoms. Any <strong>participation needs to be consistent across all courses</strong>; no documentation is required. Can only be declared once a term.</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-other-extenuating-circumstances"><strong>VIF Submission</strong></a>: for absences that do not meet the short-term absence criteria, for short-term absences that exceed the maximum number permitted per term, or for (retroactive) reports of illness or other extenuating circumstances, students must submit a Verification of Illness Form (VIF) and/or other supporting documentation electronically to the <strong>Science Undergraduate Office (SUO)</strong>. For extenuating circumstances that are not illness related, for which the VIF is not appropriate, other official documentation is necessary (for example: plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors, counsellor letters). Science maintains a page with up-to-date guidelines for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-other-extenuating-circumstances#submitting">Accommodations for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances</a> and can be reviewed as necessary.</li></ol><p>Note: filing documentation with the SUO<strong> does NOT automatically excuse the missing of a test/assignment.</strong> The course instructor will consider the information provided on the documentation when deciding whether a student should be excused. Generally, no make-up term tests will be given. If you have missed a term test for reasons that can be validated, the value of the missed test will be distributed proportionally across the other two term tests. To meet course requirements, you <strong>MUST complete two(2) term tests</strong> to pass this course.</p><p><strong>Accommodations: </strong>The University acknowledges that, due to the pluralistic nature of the University community, some students may seek accommodations on religious grounds. Accordingly, students must consult with their instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought. Failure to provide a timely request will decrease the likelihood of providing an accommodation. With sufficient notice, term tests can be re- scheduled or value of the missed test can be distributed proportionally across the other two term tests.</p><p><strong>Bonus Quizzes:  </strong>Every Wednesday at 12:20, excluding Week 4, 9 and 13, bonus quizzes will be posted to LEARN and available until Friday at 19:00. Quizzes will be multiple choice and cover that week's lecture content. While quizzes are graded, student will receive 0.1% bonus to final grade by simply completing the quiz. If all nine bonus quizzes are completed at the end of the term, student will receive an additional 0.1% to receive a total 1% bonus to their final grade. No extensions or makeup quizzes will be offered for this course element.</p><p><strong>Lab Attendance: </strong>You are expected to attend the laboratory section to which you have been assigned (<strong>104 </strong>Mon 2:30-5:20, <strong>105 </strong>Tues 9:30-12:20, <strong>101 </strong> Tues 2:30-5:20, <strong>102 </strong>Wed 2:30-5:20 and <strong>103 </strong>Thurs 2:30-5:20. If you miss one of the labs without providing your Lab Instructor Mike Allen with official medical (or other) documentation OR arranging to switch to a different section (if possible) you will lose <strong>2.5% of your final course mark</strong>. This will apply to each lab missed, up to a total of three (3) labs. To meet course requirements, <strong>you cannot miss more than three labs</strong>. Students who miss labs, exams or assignments due to illness are required to produce a Verification of Illness form; this can be completed by the University of Waterloo Health Services or an off-campus medical practitioner. This document must be taken to the Science Undergraduate Office (STC 2031) to be recorded.</p><p><strong>Lab Assignments: </strong>The laboratory exercises have incorporated questions associated with various tasks/sections in the lab manual and that you are expected to complete and provide answers to all of the questions during the exercise period. Unless otherwise noted, lab notebooks will be collected and returned in lab. If a student misses a lab where notebooks have been collected, they are responsible for contacting their TA's and arranging collection of their notebook. A late penalty of 5% per day up to a maximum of 35% (equal to submitting your assignment 7 days after the due date) will be applied to lab assignments submitted after the due date. Unless you can provide valid documentation, you will not be permitted to submit an assignment later than seven (7) days after the due date. </p><p><strong>Lab Preparation: </strong>You are expected to have read the lab exercises in full before each lab. Lab quizzes are to be completed before start of lab and are meant to help you prepare for the day's experiments (Labs #1-8, for eight total, 0.75% each). Lab quizzes are expected to be completed before the start of each lab with no extensions provided; if incomplete at the start of lab, a mark of 0 or INC will be assigned. If a student is unable to participate in a week's lab due to documented absence, the weight value of the missed course element will be redistributed to the remaining preparation assignments.</p><p><strong>Course Adjustments: </strong>Every effort will be made to adhere to the course outline and assessment provided above. However, technical issues or unanticipated circumstances may occur that alters the assessment of student knowledge (material covered, number and weight of assignments or term tests). If this is to occur, some components may be cancelled or altered and the rest of the final grade re-weighted. Regardless, we will do our best to calculate the final grade in a way that best benefits the students. </p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
