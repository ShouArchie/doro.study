<div>
<p>Biology 361 is a <u>practical course</u> in statistics and experimental design for students of the biological sciences. </p><p>The objectives of the course are to:</p><ul><li>Provide you with a set of tools and techniques so you can perform your own data analysis and experimental design. The tools include statistical-analysis tools and graphical approaches to data analysis and display.</li><li>Teach you enough to understand and critically assess the statistical portions of most articles in the biological sciences.</li><li>Equip you with the experience and vocabulary to make an exchange with a professional statistician productive.</li><li>Foster ability to make adept decisions about data analysis and form conclusions on your own.</li></ul><p>This course offers training in data handling &amp; analysis, hypothesis testing and experimental design in Biology. Topics will include: exploratory data analysis, two-sample tests, analysis of variance, categorical data analysis, correlation, linear regression, multiple linear regression, power analysis, experimental design, and data visualization tools and statistical software.</p><p>The Course Schedule provides the list of topics covered during each week of the course. The course is delivered as two hours of lectures per week (remote, asynchronous) where you will learn the background information, and 10 Lab sessions (each ~2 hours) where you’ll put statistics and data analysis into practice. Students are registered in one of 6 different Lab Sections (LAB 101-106) which are at scheduled times (i.e., in-person, synchronous) and use IBM-SPSS statistics software. The lab sessions provide important skill development and practice for activities that students will use in the written assignments and tests of the course – so, <strong>the Lab sessions are the most important components of the course! Make sure to attend them!!!</strong></p>

<p>There is no Required Textbook in BIOL 361. Textbook resources are placed in Course Reserves at UW Davis Library to support your learning at no extra cost. The course is taught with the statistical software IBM-SPSS, and students are encouraged to use this for completing the Labs and Assignments (details follow here).</p><p><strong>A. Course Software:</strong></p><p><i><strong>IBM SPSS Statistics</strong></i> (SPSS) is a sophisticated statistical software package that is widely used in research and business. The course labs and assignments require the use of this software (or other equivalent statistical and graphical software). Proficiency in use of SPSS will become a useful skill to add on your CV. You may find SPSS useful for work in other courses, and in subsequent employment. SPSS is menu-driven and thus easier to use than software that uses code. This allows you to maximize mastery of use of statistics and minimize time spent learning to use the tool. The TAs will also provide files that allow students to complete the labs in R.</p><p><strong>For this course, you will need to be able to access the statistical software IBM-SPSS (we will use version 29). </strong>To run this program on your personal computer there are two options. One option is to purchase a copy of the software to run on your computer. The other is to access SPSS remotely on the University of Waterloo Science computer network (via internet from any location on or off campus). The second option is free, but prone to glitches at inopportune times when students are trying to meet Assignment deadlines. Thus, <i><strong><u>I strongly urge students to use the first option - to purchase a copy of IBM SPSS Statistics for Students</u></strong></i>.</p><p><strong><u>Option 1</u>: [VERY, VERY, VERY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!!] </strong></p><p><strong>Purchase the Software IBM-</strong><i><strong>SPSS for Students v. 29</strong></i> (‘Base GradPack 29’ for Windows and Mac) at UW student reduced rate at On the Hub.com. </p><p><strong>6-month rental (<u>Recommended</u>: Cost = $50.62 CAD): </strong><a href="https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/OfferingDetails.aspx?o=b1b263bd-0a39-ed11-814e-000d3af41938&amp;pmv=4089c65e-9133-ed11-814e-000d3af41938&amp;ws=4c3b92f6-3b32-e611-941d-b8ca3a5db7a1&amp;vsro=8">https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/OfferingDetails.aspx?o=b1b263bd-0a39-ed11-814e-000d3af41938&amp;pmv=4089c65e-9133-ed11-814e-000d3af41938&amp;ws=4c3b92f6-3b32-e611-941d-b8ca3a5db7a1&amp;vsro=8</a></p><p>There is a 12-month rental (extends well beyond end of the course: $ 84.50) if you have reason to use SPSS after the course ends: <a href="https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/OfferingDetails.aspx?o=adb263bd-0a39-ed11-814e-000d3af41938&amp;pmv=4089c65e-9133-ed11-814e-000d3af41938&amp;ws=4c3b92f6-3b32-e611-941d-b8ca3a5db7a1&amp;vsro=8">https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/OfferingDetails.aspx?o=adb263bd-0a39-ed11-814e-000d3af41938&amp;pmv=4089c65e-9133-ed11-814e-000d3af41938&amp;ws=4c3b92f6-3b32-e611-941d-b8ca3a5db7a1&amp;vsro=8</a></p><p><strong><u> </u></strong></p><p><strong><u>Note</u>: There is no required textbook in this course, so <u>the only cost in this course is for the IBM SPSS v29 software at $51</u>. This cost is well worth avoiding inconsistencies with the free version of Option 2. </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Option 2</u> </strong><i><strong>[Free but has been prone to glitches and features that cause frustration]</strong></i><strong>: Access SPSS v29 remotely on the Microsoft Virtual Desktop Environment (AVD). For further instructions, please visit </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-computing/how-tos/software/spss"><strong>https://uwaterloo.ca/science-computing/how-tos/software/spss</strong></a><strong> .</strong></p><p>If you experience difficulties with Option 2 or do not see the software offering on the page, contact <strong>Science Computing </strong>via email at <a href="mailto:sci@uwaterloo.atlassian.net">sci@uwaterloo.atlassian.net</a><strong> [Prof. Hall and the TAs <u>CANNOT</u> assist with trouble shooting in Option 2]</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>B. Reference Books (no cost): Below is a list of books I use for the lectures.  I have placed them on 1-day reserve in the UW Davis Library so students can access them. </strong></p><p><strong>There is no required textbook that students must buy. Instead, there’s an excellent (<u>Free</u>!) online ‘textbook’ that you can use to supplement your learning of the course material – called HyperStat. </strong>It is an excellent resource with many links to other statistical resources – try it out when you have a statistical question.  <a href="http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/index.html">http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/index.html</a></p><p>For those interested in buying a statistical textbook, I recommend the one by Motulsky (#1 in the list below). Before you design your own experiments, you’ll benefit from reading the short book by Ruxton &amp; Colgrave (#8 below).

<p>The Labs and Assignments in Biology 361 are the most important part of the course!!  Statistics is like a sport in that you cannot become good at it just by reading about it – <i><strong>you must participate!</strong></i> It is for this reason that 60% of the grade in the course is based on your assignments (which build upon the Lab sessions). So, approach the Labs and Assignments with care, dedication, and timeliness (i.e., <i><strong>don’t skip the labs!</strong></i>).</p><p><strong>Each student must complete all 3 Assignments offered in this course</strong>. Assignments are posted on the course LEARN site. Your report must be submitted to a Dropbox in LEARN before the start of your assigned computer lab on the due date (see Schedule above). Assignments are generally marked and returned within 2 weeks. The marking is time-consuming, but provides important feedback (<i><strong>so, read the feedback!</strong></i>).</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>This course includes independent development and practice of specific skills by students, such as organizing data in spreadsheets for analysis by statistical software, making choices about the most effective graph and table style to display information (data), choosing the appropriate statistical test for a stated hypothesis and data set, drawing your own interpretations and conclusions from the data, and communicating your own understanding. Therefore, the use of GenAI trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class because it does not help you develop these skills. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of Policy 71 (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility, and courage (ICAI, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><p>•              Student Success Office for help with skills like note-taking and time management</p><p>•              Writing and Communication Centre for assignments with writing or presentations</p><p>•              AccessAbility Services for documented accommodations</p><p>•              Library for research-based assignments</p>

Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
