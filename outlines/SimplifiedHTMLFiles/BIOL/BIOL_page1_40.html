  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>BIOL 414:</div>
<p>Through lectures and tutorials, this course will explore how parasites affect their host(s) and interact with other parasites. Attention will be given to eukaryotic parasites impacting human and domestic animal health. Public measures of parasite control will be covered.</p>

<p><strong>Course Vision:</strong></p><p>I promote a classroom atmosphere of acceptance, honesty, and authenticity. I will try to promote understanding of concepts of parasitology over simply memorizing life cycles. I aim to provide a framework for you to see the importance of parasites in the functioning of global biodiversity - including in the human experience. There will be times when you will have to remember details, but I aim to focus on assessing your ability to communicate and synthesize. This means that rubrics, while provided, may not always express exactly what needs to be presented on paper to earn a full grade. Material is graded following the guidance of the course learning objectives and at the ultimate discretion of the instructor.</p><p>Parasitology is a topic that has, and continues to, influence our society and culture. We all come from different backgrounds, and you may have stories to share from past experiences or lessons past on from elders about some of these diseases. Everyone is welcome in my class, and I value and encourage you to share anything with me and the class (if you wish). Some great discussions have come out of sharing stories and I look forward to any opportunity we have to learn from one another.</p><p> </p><p><i><strong>How will this course run</strong></i><strong>?:</strong></p><p>This course is delivered In person and will often make use of group/class discussions. Thus, it is not representative of the learning experience to rely on class recordings. Students must make connections with others in the class and seek information on what was discussed in class from their classmates. All material discussed in class is testable. Midterm and final will occur in person.</p>

<p><strong><u>Midterm/Final Exams</u></strong></p><ul><li>Midterm/Final tests are fully written and in person. The final is cumulative.</li></ul><p><strong><u>Group Work</u></strong></p><p><strong><u>Parasitology PSA "Presentation" </u></strong></p><p>This assignment is to present to a lay audience (equivalent to highschool educated or one with comparative working knowledge in their community such as a farmer) on a topic related to parasitology, selected from a list to be provided on Learn. Topics are mostly focused on a species important to public health, animal/veterinary health, crop production, biodiversity, etc. Students will work in groups to "present" their topic in a manner that is engaging, informative and acts as an ambassador for the importance of parasitology without being tedious, "jargony", or otherwise a waste of the audience's time. The format may be a video presentation. physical pamphlet, children's book, etc may be chosen, though more innovative ideas should be discussed with Pinheiro. </p><p><strong>Generative AI</strong> <strong><u>may be used for drafting if adequetly sourced</u></strong>. Any generative ai, including ChatGPT or Grammerly may be used for the construction of early draft materials if initial outputs are provided annotated to highlight changes made by humans. Use of generative without clear description of prompts, outputs and annotated changes made will be considered a Policy 71 violation and can result in a zero grade.</p><p>All members of the group must contribute to the assignment, and members will evaluate one another at the time of draft submission and again with the final submission. Group members that do not submit group evaluations for each member of their group will earn zero on the group evaluation portions and may receive further grade penalties at Pinheiro's discretion. A group member not adequately contributing to the final product will not expect to receive the same mark on the overall assignment as other members of the group.</p><p><strong>Note: groups may "fire" a member of their group with adequate cause by <u>Friday March 21</u> via an email sent to Pinheiro and cc'ing all members of the remaining group. </strong>The group must provide evidence of attempts to contact/engage/discuss issues with the "fired" group member (usually in the form of images of emails or chat history). Pinheiro will approve or not approve the removal of the group member. While the remaining group is expected to continue the assignment as normal, the group member removed will have the remaining weight of the assignment moved to the final exam. There will not be replacement assignments provided. </p><p><strong>The assignment deliverables consists of:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Mid January: Group signup to occur in Learn - </strong>groups should be 4 students. Groups &gt; or &lt; 4 may have members reassigned</li><li><strong>Mid January: Group contract - </strong>completed collaboratively and sent to Pinheiro via email by a representative</li><li><strong>Friday March 7, 11:59pm: </strong><ul><li><strong>Draft materials and script submitted to dropbox - </strong>work to date and notes on plans for the final product required (may consist of detailed notes completed at this point and not near the final product if you wish - the more complete the submission the better feedback I can provide; any notes on generative AI usage must be submitted at this point; annotated works cited required stating what information has been used from each source (APA format)</li><li><strong>1st Group member evaluation to be submitted following instructions TBA - </strong>Evaluation of group members will be an average of grades received</li></ul></li><li><strong>Friday March 28, 11:59pm:</strong><ul><li><strong>Final submission of materials and script (if applicable) to dropbox - </strong>along with final product each group must include notes on changes made since the draft and an updated annotated reference list</li><li><strong>Final Group member evaluation submitted following instructions TBA - </strong>Evaluation of group members will be an average of grades received</li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>How to work effectively in a group:</strong></p><p>Contact your group members asap – work together to establish meet times</p><p>Set a meeting time &amp; platform if additional work besides class session are required - emailing or group chats are poor substitutes for in person meetings </p><p>All members should be included in group communications. <strong>If you have not heard from your group, it is your responsibility to contact them.</strong> It is important to work well with your group, so communicate frequently to prevent small problems from escalating. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Group Roles: </strong>These team roles increase each member’s understanding of the roles and of themselves as team members. There are four fundamental roles to consider: leader/facilitator, arbitrator/monitor, scribe/time keeper, and devil’s advocate. </p><p><u>Leader/facilitator</u></p><ul><li>Helps the group to set goals at the beginning of each meeting based on weekly tasks; these goals will serve as an agenda that needs to be addressed during the meeting.</li><li>Makes sure that all group members understand the concepts discussed and the group’s conclusions.</li><li>Starts the meetings, introduces content to be discussed, and keeps the group on task.</li><li>Ensures that the group completes its tasks before deadlines.</li></ul><p><i>Typical phrases:</i></p><ul><li>"Thanks for your contribution, Feridun. What do you think, Claire?”</li><li>"From what I hear, it appears that we could focus on A, B, and C. Why don’t we start by discussing A, if that works for everyone?”</li><li>"So, it appears that we are all agreed that …”</li></ul><p><u>Arbitrator/monitor</u></p><ul><li>During disagreements or conflicts, clarifies the arguments and proposes suggestions for resolving it.</li><li>Ensures that all group members have a chance to participate and learn; asks for comments from members if they are not participating.</li><li>Praises members for work well done.</li></ul><p><i>Typical phrases:</i></p><ul><li>"We haven’t heard much during our meeting from you, Claudia. Do you have any thoughts?” “It might be helpful if we waited a bit for your additional comments, Amy, so we can hear what Sheila has to say.”</li><li>"I’m sensing a bit of disagreement among us over this; lets talk about it more”</li><li>"I think we can feel good about what we’ve done today. Nice work on the MCQ, James!”</li></ul><p><u>Scribe/time keeper</u></p><ul><li>Is responsible for submitting work to LEARN.</li><li>Takes notes during meetings to keep a record of what has been decided, when next meeting is scheduled, etc.</li><li>Keeps track of time during meetings to avoid spending excessive time on one topic. If there are multiple items on the agenda, you will first have a short discussion with the group as to how much time will be allocated to each item. Let everyone know when time is almost up and when the time is up.</li></ul><p><i>Typical phrases:</i></p><ul><li>"Hold on, please, I just need to get this down before we move on.”</li><li>"We’ve spent about 10 of the 15 minutes we allocated to this topic, so we’ve got about 5 more minutes to sort it out.”</li></ul><p><u>Devil’s advocate</u></p><ul><li>Ensures that all arguments have been heard, and looks for holes in the group’s thinking, in case there is something overlooked.</li><li>Keeps her or his mind open to opposing ideas.</li><li>Keeps an eye out for mistakes</li></ul><p><i>Typical phrases:</i></p><ul><li>"Let’s give Tom’s idea a chance.”</li></ul><p>(Adapted from: <i>Group Roles: Maximizing Group Performance. Centre for Teaching Excellence, University of Waterloo.</i>)</p><p> </p><p><strong>Group Contract:</strong></p><p>At your first group meeting you will read through the Group Contract (in LEARN), complete and submit. Each group member should keep a copy for their records. <strong>NOTE: only the Scribe will submit the group contract on behalf of the group.</strong></p><p> </p>
