  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>BIOL 449:</div>
<p>How the health of human populations is influenced by microbial communities. Aspects of the epidemiology of infectious diseases, factors influencing the emergence of microbial pathogens and antibiotic-resistant strains, means to control undesired microbial populations in habitats such as water, biodegradable materials, and food will be discussed. Approaches to the regulation and monitoring of microbial agents will also be examined.</p>

<p><strong>Weekly quizzes:</strong> Students are expected to actively engage with the course material through weekly activities. Each quiz will address the topic covered during that week and must be completed exclusively in class. Failure to comply with this policy may result in a grade of 0% for that week or for the entire quiz component of the assessment, at the instructor's discretion.</p><p><strong>Group activity: </strong>To ensure students comprehend the application of course content in real-life situations, there will be participation in a group-based case study. These case studies are related to the topics covered in the course. You will enhance your understanding of course content by discussing your group-selected case study together with your group members. Details are posted on LEARN. Refer to the “Assignment Instructions” tab for additional information, including due dates.</p><p><strong>Group evaluation:</strong> To ensure that all group members actively participate in the case study, each member will have the opportunity to rate the participation of their fellow group members.</p><p><strong>Exams:</strong> Exams will consist of multiple choice and multi-select questions. To answer these questions, you will need to understand rather than just memorize the course content. Please see the course LEARNING OBJECTIVES above that will inspire my test questions. You may bring a non-programmable calculator. The final exam will be cumulative. Missed exams (midterm or final) will result in a grade of 0, except under special circumstances outlined below.</p><p>Final grades will not be rounded up beyond university policy and mathematical conventions. </p><p><strong>Make-up:</strong> There will be no make-up for the midterm. If the midterm is missed, due to illness, its weighting may only be added to the final examination upon submission of a verification of illness, which must be submitted prior to the midterm. </p><p>Make-up final exams will <strong>only be considered in cases of illness</strong>; <strong>no other reasons will be accepted</strong>. A missed final exam will disqualify a student from receiving a final grade and may result in an incomplete (INC), at the discretion of the instructor. The student will only be eligible to retake the exam in the next term the course is taught to receive the final grade.</p><p><i>When midterm or final exam is missed due to illness, the student should be prepared to provide a verification of illness. This information will be used to determine if the student is eligible for consideration described above. The dates affected and degree of incapacitation will be used to determine follow-up action. Students should ensure that their health care provider indicates this type of information on the medical certificate. For example, “was seen” or “attended emergency Dept on...” are not acceptable. The University of Waterloo verification of illness form is available online. Any University of Waterloo student can go to University of Waterloo Health Services.</i></p><p><i>Although illness may constitute a valid reason for missing an exam, it does not automatically entitle a student to an alternate exam.</i></p><p>Additional assessment details may be posted to the course LEARN site.</p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
