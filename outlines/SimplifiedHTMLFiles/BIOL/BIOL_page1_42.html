<p>The format for Term Test 1 and Test 2 will be true/false, fill-in-the-blank short and long-answer written exams, and possibly multiple choice.  Check announcements on LEARN for Test details and modifications. If you miss a term test or Learning Activity (LA) you will receive a grade of zero (0). If a Term Test or LA is missed due to illness or another valid, documentable reason, you <u>may</u> be granted accommodation through the following process:</p><ol><li>Contact your instructor within 24 hours of the missed exam. Emails can be received 24 hours per day.</li><li>Follow the information posted on the Faculty of Science Accommodation for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances website (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances</a>)<br/>You may take a make-up exam or in class LA at the instructor's discretion. The make-up exam or LA may be in a different format than the missed examination (e.g. oral examination for the make-up). If a make-up is deemed impossible by the instructor the points missed will be allocated to the next exam if possible. <i>Student travel plans are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination or LA </i>(<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations">https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations</a>).</li></ol><h2>Group Learning Activities</h2><p><strong>Group Formation-</strong> Learning Activities (LA) will be done in a group of 4 unless a limit in enrollment requires a smaller group. You should introduce yourself on the LEARN discussion board, form your group, enroll in LEARN group and submit your group contract by the <strong>due date in the course schedule</strong>. Group formation may take place in person during the first Tutorial as directed by the instructor if no group is secured online. Working with your group, you will complete the LAs listed under student assessment described in detail on LEARN. Submission of these LAs is described for each activity in the directions given for each on the LEARN site. Assignments submitted late will have a late penalty deduction of <strong>10<u>% per day</u></strong> for the first three late days (including weekends) after which a grade of zero (0) will be recorded. </p><p>Your attendance is required to receive credit for LAs, acquire information, and attend both term tests. The tutorial also provides organized time to work with your group, instructor, and TA. You are responsible for any information presented in the tutorial whether you attend or not and should be prepared to obtain help from your group in case of an excused absence.  Do not miss your tutorials as the activities will not be duplicated online. If you miss a term test or LA without following the process described in Student Assessment above - you will receive a zero on the assignment.</p><p>Plagiarism on any group assignment will equally affect all members, with all group members receiving the same penalty.  The group contract lays out the expectations of the members of each group.  <strong>You can be removed from a group if you do not follow the expectations in the contract through group consultation with the instructor.</strong> If this happens, you are working independently for the activity instead of within a group. If your group indicates that you have not participated in an activity that requires Tutorial attendance your name will not be included on the assignment and you will receive a zero on the assignment.</p><p>Plagiarism detection software (TURNITIN) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that the use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. Details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of TURNITIN in this course in the Assignment instructions on Learn. An alternative submission method will be available if a group has decided to opt-out of using TURNITIN to submit the assignments. Opting out must be arranged with the instructor by the end of the first week of the class. The assignments are a collaborative effort and all group members are responsible for any academic misconduct in the assignment. </p><h2>LA-4 CRISPR design project</h2><p>For the CRISPR design project, a unique mutation must be chosen by your group and approved by your Instructor (see all deadlines for the assignment on the course schedule on LEARN). Topics will be granted on a first come first serve basis. The project will consist of several submissions with both individual and group components as seen in student assessments and is summarized below (See details for every LA in the LEARN site). </p><ul><li>LA-4A CRISPR design topic approval (group)</li><li>LA-4B CRISPR gRNAs (individual and group 1- PDF)</li><li>LA-4C CRISPR ssDNA (individual and group 1- PDF)</li><li>LA-4D Written summary of the proposed design with overview and protocol (group 1- PDF)</li></ul><p>LA-4D should be written in Times New Roman, 12-point font with 1” margins. Include the title of the approved topic that you have chosen and your group number and member names.  Images should be incorporated into the paper <strong>but may not be placed in an appendix</strong>.  Your summary will include the background behind why you have chosen your mutation and an explanation of your choice of gRNA and ssDNA. This should be followed by an experimental protocol section with your proposed CRISPR experiments outlined in detail. This will include a timeline for completing the experimental process.  Experimental details on how you will perform and validate each aspect of your project must be included. This document must be fully referenced using APA format (<a href="http://www.bibme.org/citation-guide/apa/">http://www.bibme.org/citation-guide/apa/</a>).  <strong>No quotes are allowed as this must be written in your own words (no AI). </strong>Only <strong>one</strong> <strong>person</strong> from the group may make your electronic submission for both drafts and your final copy.  This copy must be deposited in Turnitin® by 11:59 pm on the due date in the course schedule. The text-matching software Turnitin® will be used to screen assignments in this course (see below). (All 7 Learning activities are described in the Learn site)<br/> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  This is being done to verify that the use of all material and sources in assignments is documented and not copied. Students will be given an option if they do not want to have their assignment screened by Turnitin®. If you do not want to use Turnitin®, you must plan this arrangement with the instructor prior to the submission of your topic for the paper and follow an alternative protocol before the beginning of the second week of class.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h2>End of Term “Grade Shopping”</h2><p>Please do not plead for an extra few marks from your course instructor either in person or by email. Some examples include: “I’m 1% away from the Dean’s Honours list” or “I got 88 in your course, but my med school application would look better if you gave me 90”. I will not respond to these requests as arbitrarily increasing your grade is unfair to the rest of the class. Your message will be deleted and you will not receive a response.</p><h2>Expectations for Change</h2><p>Given the history of the COVID-19 crisis, decisions may need to be taken that will directly affect the material covered, the number and weight of the assignments and midterms required, and the distribution of grades among completed and uncompleted components of the course. The university and/or the instructor will make every effort to keep to this course outline, but students need to be aware that all these factors may be subject to change if and when conditions change.</p><h2>The Writing and Communication Centre</h2><p> </p><p>The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/">Writing and Communication Centre</a> works across all faculties to help students clarify their ideas, develop their voices, and communicate in the style appropriate to their disciplines. Writing Centre staff offer one-on-one support in planning assignments, using and documenting research, organizing papers and reports, designing presentations and e-portfolios, and revising for clarity and coherence. </p><p>You can make multiple appointments throughout the term, or drop in at the Library for quick questions or feedback. Group appointments for team-based projects, presentations, and papers are also available.</p><p><strong>Please note</strong> that communication specialists guide you to see your work as readers would. They can teach you revising skills and strategies, but will not change or correct your work for you. Please bring hard copies of your assignment instructions and any notes or drafts to your appointment. </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as writing and developing presentations. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). <strong>Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage</strong> (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
