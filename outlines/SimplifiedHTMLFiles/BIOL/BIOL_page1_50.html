  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>The course consists of two 80 minutes long lectures each week and will roughly follow chapters from the textbook: Marine Biology: Function, Biodiversity, Ecology, Sixth Edition, by Jeffrey S. Levinton. Before the midterm and the final exam there will be a recap session in class. A few lectures may also be delivered by guest lecturers on topics that are of relevance to the course material.</p>

<p><strong><u>Exams Format- </u></strong>The format for both the midterm and final exam may be multiple choice, true/false, matching, and short answer questions. The midterm will assess material covered until reading week. The final will cover material from the entire course (i.e., pre and after midterm lectures) and will be cumulative. Check announcements on LEARN closer to the dates of the two exams for further details.</p><p><strong><u>Practice questions- </u></strong>Practice questions for the midterm and final exam will be posted in advance on LEARN so that you can test your understanding and see the style of questions that will be in the exams. I will first post the questions and give you a few days to go over them, and then post the answers. </p><p><strong><u>Recap sessions- </u></strong>We will have recap sessions during the course, one before reading week prior to the midterm, and one at the end of the course in the second half prior to the final exam. These recap sessions will be during class time and are an opportunity for us to go again together over concepts that require further clarification. We will also go over the outline of the midterm and final exam during those sessions. To make the best use of time during those sessions, I ask that students email me specific questions that they have in advance prior to the session so that I can bring the relevant slides back to class and answer specifically on what is being asked. Note that these recap sessions <strong><u>ARE NOT</u></strong> intended to go over again entire lecture topics so please be specific with what you are asking (you can point to specific slide numbers if easier). If I don’t get a lot of questions for these recap sessions, then we will move over to new material so please make sure to attend those sessions. </p><p><strong><u>Misusing the midterm-</u></strong> Absence from the midterm will result in the transfer of the weight to the final exam. A make-up midterm will not be available. Students do not need to submit a VIF for a missed midterm. The final exam must be written and will be cumulative. </p><p><strong><u>Missing the Final Exam</u></strong></p><ol><li>Contact me by email within 24-48 hours of the missed final exam. </li><li>If you are ill, please follow the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Faculty of Science illness guidelines</a>. There is a self-declaration system for COVID-19 related illness. For non-COVID-19 illness please submit a<strong> </strong><i><strong>UW Verification of Illness Form (VIF). The VIF must not be retroactive (i.e. cannot have note completed after the date of the assessment). Severe illness is the only excuse for missing an assessment.</strong></i> </li><li>For absences not related to illness (e.g. extenuating circumstances), please consult the FAQ on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Science webpage</a> for suggested documentation.</li><li>Submit your documentation to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Science Undergraduate Office </a>within one week from the exam date and complete their process. An automated Illness Certificate will be sent to me by email. Please email me also a copy of the VIF.</li><li>If your VIF is not submitted within one week, or is not valid, a grade of zero (0) will be recorded for the missed exam.</li></ol><h4> </h4><p> </p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as <strong>[fill this in with your discipline-specific skills]</strong>. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
