  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>BIOL 302:</div>
<p>A hierarchical approach to biological structure with an emphasis on functional morphology. Starting with the cell, the fundamental unit of structure and function, the material progressively develops how cells organize to form tissues such as epithelium, connective tissue, and muscle. Emphasis on how these tissue building blocks cooperate to form the major organs and organ systems of the human body. The laboratory component includes preparation and staining of tissues for microscopy, and use of virtual tools for viewing high resolution tissue scans.</p>

<p><strong>COURSE SUMMARY</strong></p><p>This course will introduce you to the cellular components and building blocks that make up tissues and organs. You will learn how the structure and function of cells (microscopic) can be applied to understanding and identifying tissues (macroscopic) through exposure to histology slides.</p><p> </p><p><strong>PREREQUISITES</strong></p><p>BIOL 302 requires BIOL 130 and BIOL 273. It is assumed that students have a basic understanding of cell biology and cell function. Students that don’t find this course very challenging. Make sure you know your cell biology, particularly how to identify a nucleus.</p><p> </p>

<p><strong>Evaluation  </strong><br/><br/>There will be two online midterm exams held during ‘scheduled class time.’ <strong>Midterms are held online on Learn</strong>. The dates for the midterms are <strong>February 10th</strong> and <strong>March 17th</strong>. Midterms are not cumulative per se although material from earlier lectures (especially cell biology &amp; tissue identification/characterization) is essential for understanding course content. It is your responsibility to read and understand the information on <a href="file:///C:/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=158826&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=uWaterloo-10488">Exam Policies</a><u> (</u><a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Assignments-Tests-and-Final-Exams">http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Assignments-Tests-and-Final-Exams</a>).</p><p>There are short quizzes (see schedule and posted on Learn) linked to the Lab Readings based on the online Slides available through Biolucida.

  Notice of Recording

<p>I will try to provide a hybrid format using Teams linked to the course, but cannot guarantee it will always be provided due to connectivity issues, etc. I will also try to record lectures and provide them on Learn as time permits.</p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>ATTENDENCE POLICY - LABS &amp; READINGS (BIOLUCIDA)</strong></p><p>Do the Lab work and Readings. Lab Attendance is required to submit your final report. It is important that you look at slides and look at as many as possible. Most of the images in your text are very clear and you will see markedly different views of the same tissues in the Lab/Biolucida. Ask questions. Work as a group. Take your time and find everything more than once. It is in the Lab and the online slides (Biolucida) that you will learn to identify cells and tissues. Lecture tells you what they look like, how to find them, what they do. Biolucida, the Reading assignments, and the Lab complement Lectures. Skipping/Missing either will make this course very difficult. In the past lab attendance and slide viewing has directly correlated with grades. </p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Tissue slides are now available online at much higher resolution than in-person viewing on a microscope in previous years. Through Biolucida, you have access to other online libraries. Strongly recommend that you use them too. </p><p><strong>MATERIAL REPRODUCTION</strong></p><p>The material used in lectures stems from the generosity of many individuals and sometimes includes unpublished research materials from my own lab. The material is used with the consent of the owners of the images for the purpose of teaching only. Do not reproduce this material or submit lecture material to courseware sharing sites as this has in the past resulted in image permissions being withdrawn. Please be aware that it is an academic infraction to use course materials for individual profit (such as posting to courseware sharing sites).</p><p><strong>CHEATING</strong></p><p>There are no excuses and no tolerance for cheating. Cheating includes searching for answers (or even ‘double-checking’ them) during online exams, tests, assessments, etc. This also includes discussing the course through any means during the exam period (text, reddit, carrier pigeon, etc.). So, if the exam/quiz is open for 24 h, you cannot discuss it with anyone until it’s over. If you have to ask yourself if what you’re doing may constitute as cheating, it’s probably considered cheating. </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
