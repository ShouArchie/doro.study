<p> </p><h2>Achieve Online Assignments</h2><p>See the BIOL 130 LEARN site for full instructions and access to the Achieve Online Assignments associated with the textbook Biology: How Life Works. There is a late penalty of 5%/day for the first three (3) days of missing the assignment deadline. After this, a grade of zero (0) will be recorded.</p><h2>Term Test 1 and 2</h2><p>The format for <u>all</u> term tests will be multiple choice questions. The term tests take place in the lecture room during class time according to the course schedule. Each exam is cumulative. </p><h2>Missed Exam or Assignment Policy</h2><p>The format for the course assessments can be found on the BIOL 130 LEARN site. If you miss an assessment you will receive a grade of zero (0). </p><p>If the assessment was missed due to illness or another valid, documentable reason, you <u>may</u> be granted accommodation through the following process:</p><ol><li>Contact your section instructor within 24 hours of the missed assessment.  Emails can be received 24 hours per day. Accommodations for missed assessments will <u>not</u> be granted if you do not make contact via email.</li><li>If you are ill, please follow the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Faculty of Science illness guidelines</a>. There is a self-declaration system for COVID-19 related illness or short-term absence. For non-COVID-19 illness please have submit a<strong> </strong><i><strong>UW Verification of Illness Form (VIF). The VIF must <u>not be retroactive</u> (i.e. cannot have note completed after the date of the exam). <u>Severe illness</u> is the only excuse for missing an exam.</strong></i> Note that instructors are under no obligation to accept your medical documentation, and they should not be viewed as a “get out of jail card”, if an instructor has reason to believe you were not actually ill, it can be rejected.</li><li>For absences not related to illness, please consult the FAQ on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Science webpage</a> for suggested documentation.</li><li>Submit your documentation to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Science Undergraduate Office</a> (SUO) within one week from the exam date and complete their process. An automated Illness Certificate will be sent to your instructor by email.</li><li>If your VIF or documentation is not submitted within one week, or is not valid, a grade of zero (0) will be recorded for the missed assessment.</li></ol><p>The weight of the missed term test(s) or Achieve Online Assignment(s) will be added to the final exam weight once proper documentation has been submitted.  There are <u>no make-up</u> or alternative term tests. <i>Student travel plans are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time</i> (see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations">https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations</a>).</p><p> </p><p><u>Additional Accessibility Criteria Information</u></p><ul><li>The format used for instruction: in-person lecture</li><li>The technologies used for instruction/testing: LEARN, Achieve</li><li>Disability-related policies: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policies/policy-58-accessibility">Policy 58 - Accessibility </a>and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/student-academic-accommodation-guidelines">Student Academic Accommodation Guidelines</a></li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p><strong>Expectations for Change</strong>: Dependent on public health concerns, decisions may need to be taken that will directly affect material covered, the number and weight of the assignments and term tests required, the format of delivery or assessment, and the distribution of grades among completed and uncompleted components of the course. While the university and lecturers will make every effort to keep to this course outline, students should be aware that all of these factors may be subject to change if and when conditions change.</p><p> </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>The use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
