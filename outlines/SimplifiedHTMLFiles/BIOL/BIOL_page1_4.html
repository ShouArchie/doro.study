<p>What does it mean to be a cell biologist? One group of scientists might explore growing tissues in a laboratory to one day produce artificial skin or organs. Other groups might be working on understanding a genetic disease, curing cancer or making vaccines. Sometimes it means investigating enzymatic pathways in yeast so we can understand how life works in other organisms like humans or to understand how cells work in healthy and diseased states. No matter what their question, cell biologists use a similar set of laboratory skills that allow them to peek inside the tiniest of biological units that make up the diversity of organisms we see around us.</p><p>Although fundamental techniques like microscopy have hugely advanced since the invention of the light microscope, every cell biologist needs to learn how to properly use a microscope to see cells reliably. Working with cells means you must use very small volumes of liquids, and the tool used for this in the lab is the micropipette. These can be very tricky to use properly but doing so could be the difference between a world-changing discovery and an experiment that no one can replicate. These and other methods that are integral to working in the cell biology field will be introduced in this laboratory and it is my hope that you will leave confident in these fundamental techniques.</p><p>In the BIOL 130L course, during the lab periods and through written assignments, such as discussion questions and lab reports, students will develop proper lab practices and acquire analytical skills necessary for working in a biology lab. </p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <br/>*Academic Integrity Quiz is for completion only but is mandatory to gain access to submission Dropboxes)</p><p><strong>Online Lab Quizzes and Assignments </strong></p><p>The Academic Integrity (AI) quiz will test your understanding of academic integrity. <strong>Before you can submit your first lab report, you must pass the AI quiz with 100%.</strong> You have unlimited attempts to complete it. <strong>To access the AI quiz, you must first view all the topics in the Academic Integrity module (Academic Integrity FAQs).</strong> Once you have cleared the AI quiz, the Dropbox for submission of the final versions of your lab reports will open.</p><p>There are several quizzes and short assignments throughout the term that are meant to be taken once you have reviewed the lab content. They will help you prepare for the in-person labs or teach you important skills to succeed in BIOL130L and future science courses. Online content will be open for everyone starting the beginning of the term, with deadlines as indicated on LEARN. You are welcome to start on these assignments earlier than indicated in the schedule. The readiness quizzes will be time-released closer to the laboratory dates when they are performed. </p><p>Please note that the BIOL 130L online multiple-choice quizzes are designed with Universal Learning principles in mind, that is I have doubled the amount of time that you are allowed to complete the quiz relative to how long it takes to do each quiz (e.g., you are given 15 min for an 8 min quiz). As such, there will be no time adjustment for students registered with the Accessibility Services (quiz design and delivery framework is based on best practices of the Universal Design for Learning, UDL). However, those of you who require more than double the time for your test writing (anyone with 60 extra minutes per hour of testing) will need extra time above the 15 minutes and should reach out to the instructor to confirm this time was added. I welcome any inquiries regarding AccessAbility accommodations.</p><p><strong>Lab Reports </strong></p><p>Lab report writing is a key skill practiced in this course. There are two lab reports required for this course and <strong>you must submit at least one lab report and obtain a passing grade for it to pass the course</strong>.<strong> </strong>If you did not write, submit, and get a passing grade for any of lab reports, but your calculated grade is passing, your passing grade will be decreased to 49, and you will have to repeat the course. </p><p> <strong>Practical Assessments</strong></p><p>Your TAs will assess your ability to use instruments in the lab (e.g., microscopy, spectroscopy) and perform key lab exercises like dilutions to use as your final mark for this category. Assessments will be carried out during the lab, and you will have the opportunity to practice and attempt the practical assessment multiple times if necessary. </p><p><strong>Subjective Mark </strong></p><p>Your TAs will assess your professional behaviour in the lab, lab performance and understanding of lab protocols during the lab and assign a subjective mark (10%). TAs will make notes on your skills and attitude in the lab. Some examples of what will be noted includes the following:</p><ul><li>did you complete the bioskills exercises during the first lab?</li><li>did you come to the lab on time and prepared (e.g., did you complete your flow chart)?</li><li>did you complete your work before leaving?</li><li>did you perform experiments instead of passively observing your partner’s work?</li><li>did you follow lab safety rules (for example, you always put electronic devices away and wore safety goggles as needed)?</li><li>did you clean up your workspace after you were done and put dirty glassware away properly?</li><li>did you work to improve your lab skills like pipetting or microscopy and used your lab equipment properly/according to instructions? There are no penalties for asking questions, but you will be penalized for misuse of equipment.</li><li>did you behave in a respectful and professional manner in the lab?</li></ul><p>Please note, you will be using micropipettes frequently this term and there are a few simple rules to follow so that they don’t break. The following misuse of the micropipettes will result in a 1% deduction from your final subjective mark:</p><ul><li>Using a micropipette without a tip,</li><li>Holding a micropipette upside down with liquid in the micropipette tip,</li><li>Setting a micropipette precariously close to the edge of the bench so that it may fall on the floor,</li><li>Pipetting too quickly, thus taking up the liquid into the shaft of the pipette.</li><li>Forcing the pipettes past their minimum and maximum calibrated ranges</li></ul><p>If you have any questions about your earned subjective mark, please reach out to your TA or the course instructor. </p><p><strong>Lab Book </strong></p><p>Keeping a thorough lab book is a critical skill learned in a biology laboratory to document key observations and procedures. For this course you will be required to have a separate lab book in which you will record a procedure summary before each lab; the experimental steps you perform in the lab and any comments on what you did differently that may or may not influence your results. We suggest that you buy a green Biology lab book (soft covered) from the W Store Essentials in STC for this purpose. (If you cannot purchase a green Biology lab book you will need to get a <strong>thin, soft-covered notebook which does not have a spiral backbone and from which pages cannot be removed</strong>).</p><p>Your TAs will review and initial your lab book during the labs; you must come prepared (i.e., you must have sufficient information in your lab book that will enable you to complete the lab experiment without the lab manual). The TAs will check your lab book periodically and/or at the end of the term, so make sure it stays up to date and add page numbers to your lab book as you go. Acceptable writing utensils include pens and markers. Writing utensils used in the lab book must be permanent. Do not remove pages or completely cover any mistakes made; cross them out so they are still legible and start again.</p><p>There are discussion questions at the end of each lab. These can be done before or after performing the lab, but <strong>all answers to the discussion questions must be written in your lab book</strong>. They will be checked by your TAs throughout the term. </p><p>Please note that when we collect lab books at the end of the term if you do not claim your lab book, by first day of classes the following term, they will be appropriately discarded. </p><p><strong>Late Assignments </strong></p><p>You will have a 24-hour slip day for each assignment or lab report. You do not need to email the instructor or the TAs if you submit past the due date but within this 24-hour slip day period. For lab reports only, reports that are submitted after this period will be considered late and will be subject to a late penalty of <strong>5% per day up to a period of 3 days after which time they will no longer be accepted (weekends count as 2 days)</strong>. There is no late penalty period for assignments, they will <strong>not</strong> be accepted after the slip date. Please mark due dates in your calendar to help you meet these deadlines.</p><p><strong>Lab Expectations </strong></p><p>1. <strong>Attendance. </strong>You must attend the laboratory section to which you have been enrolled into in Quest. TAs will check the attendance for each lab. If you have recently added the course, you may not be on the attendance list; you may have to show proof of enrolment in the appropriate lab section number. <strong>You must attend the first lab to remain in the course.</strong></p><p>2. <strong>Arrive on time.</strong> Be in the lab a few minutes early and check if your lab bench is clean and ready for equipment. To keep distractions to a minimum, the doors to the lab will close once the lab begins. If you are going to be more than 5 minutes late, please arrange to attend a different section. </p><p>3. <strong>Missed labs.</strong> In case of illness (or another valid reason), you can make up a lab in another section. Arrangements must be made with a course instructor. If you are ill, bring a signed copy of the Verification of Illness form (available on the University of Waterloo Campus Wellness website) to the Science Undergraduate Office (STC 2031) or complete the VIF form online. The information will be electronically sent to all your course instructors. </p><p> Laboratory exercises are all about hands-on experience, as such you are asked to attend all your scheduled lab sessions. <strong>If you miss your lab without a valid reason,</strong> <strong>you will lose 10% of your final course mark</strong>. If you miss two or more, you will not be able to complete the course, even if you provide official documentation. Your final mark for the course will be recorded as INC (incomplete), and you will have to complete the missed components the next time the course is offered. </p><p>4. <strong>Temporary Section changes. </strong>Please contact Biol130L@uwaterloo.ca regarding switching laboratory sections temporarily. This can be accommodated due to illness, conflicts with other courses (e.g., exams) or other extenuating circumstances. You cannot attend a different section than one you are enrolled in without getting the instructors permission. Please note that your TAs cannot grant section changes so reach out to your instructor as soon as you miss a section or have a identified a time conflict. </p><p>5. <strong>Technology use in labs. </strong>Having electronic devices poses a distraction in the lab, it can affect your workflow and safety, as well as result in possible contamination of your electronic devices with the materials and reagents we use. As such, we are not allowing the use of laptops, cell phones or any electronic devices in the laboratory (except if explicitly told by TAs to do so or as an approved accommodation through AccessAbility Services). </p><p>6. <strong>Lab partners.</strong> Unless your TA indicates otherwise, all experiments in this course will be done by 2 students working as a pair. Usually, all necessary materials will be set out on the side benches. Some of the equipment will have to be brought back to your bench, while other things must be used at the side bench. Some reagents will already be set up to use at your bench, while others will be in dispensing bottles on the side bench or in the fume hoods, in which case the liquid must be dispensed directly from the bottles. Please follow posted instructions during the lab. Please do not waste material; if you measure with care, you should not run out of any reagents. And of course, an important rule, never pour anything back into the original container if you accidentally took too much! </p><p> You can learn a lot by discussing course material with your peers, but you must be cautious that the work you submit for grading must be your own ideas and words as they are individual assessments. You cannot borrow results from peers in the lab (unless you and your lab partner were instructed to obtain results together) or friends from different sections. If you do so, neither your nor their lab reports will be marked. You cannot share your report (even if you’re just trying to be helpful) either in written form or electronically with another student. Please see the ‘Academic Integrity’ page on LEARN, or the <u>Faculty of Science Academic Integrity web page</u> for more information. Please review the section on Expectation of Academic Integrity in this lab manual. </p><p>7. <strong>Preparing for in-person experiments by making flowcharts.</strong> Prior to each lab you are required to read through your lab material and arrive at your lab with a flowchart (or equivalent way to succinctly record procedure, for example point form would also be acceptable). The goal is not to rewrite all the steps in the manual but to have a summary that will guide you through your experiments.</p><p>8. <strong>Readiness quizzes.</strong> Prior to your arrival to each of the main five experiments, you will also need to complete an <strong>online quiz</strong> to assess your readiness to do the lab. Content covered will include questions about the experiments, lab protocols and safety. Please note that these quizzes will be released on a schedule so that you can only complete them the week prior to the lab, and they will no longer be available the day before the lab (check LEARN for your specific deadline).</p><p><strong>SAFETY</strong></p><ol><li>You must always wear a lab coat and have eye protection (safety glasses/goggles or prescription glasses) in the lab. These can be purchased at the W Store Essentials in the STC. Gloves must be worn when indicated by your TAs.</li><li>Contact lenses may accumulate harmful gases from the atmosphere, and lead to severe eye irritation. Since many standard laboratory reagents are volatile, please consider not wearing contact lenses in the laboratory.</li><li>YOU MUST complete the WHMIS training module for students on UW-LEARN before the first lab.  (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/training/student-safety-orientation-whmis">https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/training/student-safety-orientation-whmis</a>)</li><li>DO NOT eat or drink in the laboratory; this includes chewing gum or candy.</li><li>Note the location of safety equipment - you will not have time to do so during an emergency. Safety showers, or a hand-held shower, can be used to wash spilled chemicals from the skin, or to rinse eyes, Eye wash stations to rinse eyes, fire extinguishers or fire blankets to extinguish flames.</li><li>Locate and examine safety signs located near doors. These indicate exit routes and additional safety instructions for fire, chemical spills, injuries or lock down procedures.</li><li>In the case of any cuts, spills, breakage or other accident, <strong>inform your TA at once</strong>. If any material contacts your skin, treat the spill as if it were dangerous, and flush immediately with water.</li><li>Work benches and walkways must be kept clear.

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  A plagiarism detection software (Turnitin) will be used to screen laboratory reports and assignments in this course. This is done to verify that use of all material and sources in reports is documented. There are two laboratory reports for this course. The laboratory reports must be submitted online into the Turnitin Dropbox (in a Word format, *.doc, or Portable Document Format, *.pdf).  <br/>If you do not wish to have your work submitted to Turnitin: <br/>•	You need to inform your instructor immediately after completion of laboratory #1. <br/><br/>If you do not wish to have your lab report screened by Turnitin, before the submission of the final paper you will have to submit to your TAs the following: <br/>•	An outline of your report, due 24 hours after completion of the lab for which you are writing the lab report. <br/>•	A draft of the lab report, due 72 hours after completion of the lab for which you are writing lab report. The draft must contain the complete list of resources used as well as the copy of pdf for each used journal article. <br/><br/>Please note that you must submit every assignment in the appropriate Dropbox. Since it is not possible to move the files over to the correct Dropbox for marking, if you submit your lab report into the wrong Dropbox you will automatically receive a 0 for the lab report. Requests to allow re-submission to the correct Dropbox will result in a 5% deduction from the lab report mark. <br/><br/>Submitting Lab Reports Online with Turnitin <br/>Students will have the opportunity to submit a maximum of two draft versions for each BIOL 130L lab report to check Turn-it-in plagiarism analysis prior to submitting your final draft to the LEARN Dropbox. The purpose of the draft Dropbox is to help you identify and correct any problems before you submit your final version for grading. Your instructor will not access these draft versions for grading. They will be reviewed at the end of the term for statistical purposes only. The goal of the draft submissions is to teach you the capabilities of Turn-it-in analysis and to encourage you to use the software to improve your paraphrasing and referencing. Details on how to interpret Turn-it-in reports and use the draft Dropboxes can be found under Content on LEARN. <br/><br/>To gain access to the draft Dropbox: <br/> <br/>•	You MUST complete the “Turn-it-in Draft Dropbox Agreement”, found under quizzes, to gain access to the draft Dropbox. You MUST agree to all 3 points acknowledging that you understand the terms. If you do not agree to all 3 points mentioned above the draft Dropbox will stay closed for you. This will not be discussed, and the course Instructor will not respond to the emails regarding this issue.<br/>•	You MUST complete the Academic Integrity Quiz (AIQ) and obtain a score of 100% to gain access to this Dropbox.<br/>Similarly, <br/>•	You MUST complete the Academic Integrity Quiz (AIQ) and obtain a score of 100% to gain access to the Lab Report Submission dropbox. Please keep in mind that the AIQ will not be accessible for you if you did not read the material presented in the Academic Integrity Module. <br/> <br/>While submitting to the draft Dropbox is optional, you must submit your final report to the final lab report Dropbox to be marked. (i.e., unless you make alternative arrangements, you must complete the AIQ). Reports submitted ONLY to the draft Dropbox will NOT be marked.

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p><strong>AccessAbility Services</strong></p><p>The AccessAbility Services (AAS), located in Needles Hall, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities, without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, you must register with the AAS at the beginning of each academic term. To support the health and safety of students, those who have a permanent, temporary, or suspected disability or medical condition (including pregnancy) that may affect their ability to complete labs (or interfere with attendance at labs), are asked to contact AAS to ensure that appropriate accommodations and preparations have been considered. </p><p>As outlined under Quizzes section above, please note that the BIOL 130L online multiple-choice quizzes are designed to be completed in half the time you are given. As students are given extra time, there will be no time adjustment for students registered with the Accessibility Services (quiz design and delivery framework is based on best practices of the Universal Design for Learning, UDL). However, those of you who require more than double the time for your test writing (anyone with 60 extra minutes per hour of testing) will need extra time above the 15 minutes and should reach out to the instructor to confirm this time was added.</p><p><strong>Expectation of Academic Integrity </strong></p><p>Any attempt on the part of a student to gain an unfair advantage may be construed as academic misconduct, irrespective of whether any benefit was gained by the student(s) concerned. For details on the procedures used to address allegations of misconduct, see the <u>Faculty of Science</u> <u>Academic Integrity web page</u> and the Academic Integrity section of the course’s LEARN site. Please see the following table for common mistakes that happen and how they will be addressed in this course. </p><p><strong>Use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) writing tools is not permitted in this course</strong></p><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as scientific writing and communication. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of Policy 71 (https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71; plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.
