<h4><strong>Assignments: </strong></h4><p>There are three (3) equally weighted seminar assignments in (approximately) the first half of the term due on the date specified in the course schedule. These are to be completed <i><strong><u>individually (i.e not group work)</u></strong></i>. Assignments should be handed in at the start of class, before the class begins. There are no make-up assignments available for missed deadlines and weighting cannot be transferred to other items. </p><h4><strong>Midterms/Examinations:</strong> </h4><p>***Note there is <u>no final examination</u> for this course. Instead, there are <u>two “midterm” examinations</u>. </p><p><strong><u>Students must earn an average passing grade of 50% or greater across the midterms to pass the course, as these assess your individual knowledge</u></strong>. Students who do not achieve a grade of 50% or higher averaged across their two midterms will receive a grade of 46% or the average grade across their two midterms, whichever is lower. </p><p>Exam format will be written response and will test your knowledge on material from lectures/papers, techniques, ability to analyze data and design experiments to test hypothesis, and ability to synthesize and critically analyze a paper.</p><ul><li>Midterm #1 will be based on all material covered before the exam including lectures, paper discussions, group discussions, worksheets, assignments.</li><li>While ~50% of Midterm #2 will mainly focus on material covered after Midterm #1, Midterm #2 is cumulative and students should still have an excellent mastery of the material covered in the first half of the course as the immune system is interconnected and many of the same techniques are used in immunology research. Thus, students are still expected to know these immunology concepts and techniques. The other ~50% of Midterm 2 will be questions on a <strong><u>new</u> </strong>research paper (I.e. has not been covered in class) that students will be required to critically read and interpret. This paper will be posted to D2L ~2 weeks before Midterm #2. This is to test your ability to synthesize and critically analyze a paper.</li><li><i><strong>Examinations are “open book” and are to be completed individually.</strong></i> Students are permitted to use a <strong><u>hard copy</u></strong> of lecture notes and the papers discussed (class materials) on the exam (no worksheets or assignments permitted). <strong>However, students should should have a mastery of the material such that they could complete the midterm without course materials as there is not enough time to learn material during exams</strong> – lecture notes and papers are for quick reference in case you have forgotten a detail. Use of electronic devices (computers, tablets, phones, smart watches, etc.) or any other materials is <strong><u>NOT</u></strong> permitted.</li><li>If we have in-person exams, all usual University of Waterloo policies surrounding examinations will apply (I.e. you must bring your WatCard, no cell phones on your person, no wearing of hats, only clear water bottles are allowed, no food is permitted, etc).</li><li>Examinations will be viewable by  appointment with Dr. Katzenback for two (2) weeks following the release of grades. If a student wishes a question to be re-graded, the student must submit a written explanation/justification as to why they believe the question was graded incorrectly within 2 weeks following the release of grades, and the entire item is subject to re-grading.</li></ul><h4><strong>Group Oral Presentations and Group Written Paper Critiques:</strong> </h4><ul><li>Each student will work in  groups of 3-4 (group size may vary based on class size) to prepare an oral presentation and a written paper critique.  The presentation and the written critique  review will cover different topics.</li><li>Dates for group oral presentations and group written paper critiques will be determined in class after the add/drop period (usually sometime during the 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> week of class). A list of topics will be posted in advance of the class and sign-up for topics will occur in class. Students should be aware that they will stay in the same group for both the group oral presentation and the group written paper critique.</li><li>During the second half of the course, each week will cover one topic. There will be two primary literature papers per topic. These papers will be different but related. At the start of the topic, we will have a short intro to the topic, followed by group presentations (two papers per topic, one per class), and then a worksheet to aid in students synthesizing the information from and across the papers. Links to the primary literature papers that will form the basis for each respective student presentation or paper critique will be posted a minimum of two (2) weeks prior to the due date to ensure that all students have ample time to prepare their deliverables.</li><li><strong><u>Group Oral Presentations</u></strong>: Presentations will be a critique of the paper and will be approximately 25 minutes in length followed by ~5 minutes for questions. <strong>Presentations should be submitted (as pptx) at least 24 hours prior to the start of the class in which the presentation will be made to the corresponding Dropbox folder on Learn</strong>. Late presentations (that is, submitted less than 24 h before the start of class in which the presentation is due) will result in a 10% loss in the overall grade assigned to this deliverable for all group members. Students should bring a copy of their presentation (in pdf or pptx) on a USB key (or have it on a laptop they will be using) and arrive a few minutes early so that the presentation can be loaded onto the podium computer. </li><li><strong><u>Group Written Paper Critiques</u></strong>: Written paper critiques should be a maximum of 4 pages, double spaced, in 12 pt Times New Roman font with no less than 2.54 cm margins on all sides, not including figures or references. <strong>Paper critiques should be submitted 24 h prior to the start of class in which the paper is to be discussed through the  Dropbox folder on the BIOL441 course page on D2L. </strong>Late paper critiques will result in a grade of “0”.</li><li>For all group deliverables: groups must include a credit statement indicating the contribution of each member to the group. This does not need to be shown during the oral presentation (but a slide needs to be included with this information in the version submitted to Learn) and does not count towards page limits for the Group Written Paper Critique (this information can be placed on the title page).</li><li><i><u>Peer evaluation</u></i>: Of the grade assigned to each item (presentation or written critique), 3% will be based on how your other group members evaluate your contribution to the final product. More details on how peer evaluation for each deliverable will be conducted will be provided at a later date.</li><li><i><u>Worksheets</u></i>: After both student presentations, students will work in groups (students should mix groups for this part) to work collaboratively to discuss and formulate answers to questions posed in the worksheet. These worksheets are not graded but will greatly help you improve your understanding of the material and begin forming linkages between the papers. <strong>Each student is responsible for their own mastery of the paper being presented, regardless of whether they presented the paper or not or how well the paper was presented, as it is expected everyone will have learned the skills of how to do this by the second half of the course</strong>.</li><li>If you need help with writing your critique or tips on preparing presentations, please consider engaging with the Writing Centre on campus – they are here as a resource to all students and are always willing to help (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/">https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/</a> ) </li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>What if I am ill and miss a class or two - how do I get course information?</strong> </p><p>-Lectures are based off review literature and primary literature and students have continuous access to these items on Learn. This means that a student can obtain pertinent information, using the posted lectures as a guide, to acquire the bulk of the missed information by reading these posted materials.</p><p>-Reach out to your classmates to obtain a copy of their notes.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What if I am ill during the time scheduled for my group's Group presentation?</strong></p><p>Notify Dr. Katzenback and your group members ASAP - the group can work with Dr. Katzenback to identify a suitable solution. See the section below on what to do in the event of illness (essentially, you will need to obtain a VIF). </p><p> </p><p><strong>What if I am ill during a midterm? </strong></p><p>A VALID Verification of Illness Form (VIF; see below) must be supplied in order to qualify for a make-up midterm. Submit a completed VIF to the Science Undergraduate Office (SUO), within 48 hours, if you are well enough to do so. Exceptions include students who are infectious, very ill and/or hospitalized.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What to do in the event of an illness or other extenuating circumstance:</strong></p><p>Please visit this website to obtain up-to-date UW policies on what to do if you are ill or have an extenuating circumstance (also covers religious observations and bereavement): https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submitting</p><p>At the time of writing, students have three (3) options:</p><ol><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences"><strong>Short-term Absence</strong></a> - an absence of 2 calendar days or less during the Formal Lecture Period self-declared for any reason that prevents a student from meeting their academic obligations, with the exception of Studio (STU), Laboratory (LAB), and Clinic (CLN) courses/class components (STU, LAB, and CLN courses/class components <strong>do not</strong> qualify for accommodation as a result of a self-declared short-term absence).</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences#covid-19-related-absence"><strong>Covid-19-related Absence</strong></a><strong> </strong>- an absence of 10 days or less due to Covid-10 related illness, with some limitations (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-other-extenuating-circumstances#absences-and-documentation">below</a>).</li><li>Submitting a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services"><strong>Verification of Illness Form - </strong></a>For other conditions or those lasting more than 14 days, within 24h you must obtain a<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances"> verification of illness form</a> (VIF) and submit this within 48h <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#vif</a></li></ol><p>In all cases, you should contact the instructor within 24 h to make any necessary arrangements. </p><p>A valid VIF must specifically state specifically state examination by a physician covering the day of the illness and must not be retrospective.  Compassionate leave (e.g., death in the immediate family) will be granted by the instructor/lecturer on a case-by-case basis and will normally require validation by documentation.  Please make contact as soon as possible in this event so judgment can be made <u>before</u> the examination. <strong>Note</strong>: for purposes of what constitutes a doctor or physician, that person must be registered in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario.</p><p><strong>It is NOT an automatic right of students to be granted deferrals!</strong></p><p><u>For further information regarding missed tests/exams, please refer to:</u></p><p>https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/home</p><p>https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations#info</p><p>https://uwaterloo.ca/biology/undergraduate-studies/academic-integrity</p><h4> </h4><p><strong>**Please remember that travel arrangements are not an acceptable reason to miss course elements.

(UW academic regulations)</p><p> </p><p><strong>Unauthorized co-operation or collaboration (excessive collaboration)</strong></p><p>This is a form of plagiarism that occurs when someone writes sentences, or constructs paragraphs for you.  This also applies to art, graphs, diagrams or figures, data, and calculations. Unintentional plagiarism (e.g., I was just getting help; I ran out of time; we wrote the sentences together) is still plagiarism. It is not the instructor’s job (and it is not possible), to uncover a student’s motives for plagiarizing. It is what it is.</p><p>Students should treat their academic work as their own property. It is the responsibility of students to protect their own work. Students should ensure that electronic copies of their work are stored securely and cannot be copied or stolen by another person; for example, in computer laboratories. Allowing someone to represent your work as their own is also academic misconduct.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Examples of plagiarism and excessive collaboration</strong></p><ul><li>working with another person on an <i>individual</i> assignment/test</li><li>having someone else complete all or part of your assignment for you</li><li>having someone rewrite your assignment for you</li><li>obtaining, or attempting to obtain, assistance with an individual assignment, for example, by using an essay-writing service or any artificial intelligence (AI) system, platform, or service</li><li>obtaining, or attempting to obtain, access to assignment/test materials (e.g., examination/quiz/ i-clicker questions) including questions/answers/marking schemes during, prior to, or after the assignment/test without explicit permission from an instructor or TA.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
