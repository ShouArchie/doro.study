  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>BIOL 341:</div>
<p>This course will provide students with an understanding of the fundamental concepts of the vertebrate immune system. Topics will focus on the components of the immune system, innate and adaptive immunity, immune cell development, communication, and recognition of non-self leading to an immune response. Theory will be complemented with laboratory experiments applying immunological techniques.</p>

<p>The immune system is central to life; it is important in maintaining whole body homeostasis and acts to defend against pathogens, conferring health to all organisms. How organisms regulate health versus disease is a central concept in the life sciences and has been the subject of intense study for over 100 years. An understanding of immunology is essential in order to fully comprehend the disease process and disease treatments. </p>

<h3><strong>Midterm exam (25%):</strong> </h3><p>50 minutes during “class time”, comprising multiple choice, matching terms, and/or definitions and written answer questions.</p><h3><strong>Quizzes (5%):</strong> </h3><p>Throughout the course, online quizzes will be assigned to complete. These are meant to encourage students to read the assigned pages in the textbook and think about material presented in lecture to enhance student learning and understanding<strong>. </strong>You will be allowed three (3) attempts at achieving a passing score of 70%. Once this passing mark is achieved you will receive one (1) participation mark for that quiz. If after three (3) attempts you do not achieve a score 70% or higher on any of the attempts, you will be assigned a zero (0) for that quiz.  Only the highest score from all attempts will be used to determine whether a participation mark is awarded.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3><strong>UW policy for illness </strong></h3><p>A medical certificate is required if exams are missed; it must be presented to the Science Undergraduate Office and processed. Please notify the instructors, preferably before, but definitely within 24 hours of exam. There will only be one (1) make up exam date, students who miss that will write the exam the next time a BIOL 341 class does. Science policy states that only VIFs issued from our campus Health Services (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic</a> ) will be acceptable documentation when the service is available. Obviously, a student who is sick on a weekend, during off hours, while out of town or receiving ongoing care from a family physician or specialist may have to provide valid and suitably informative VIF from other health service providers. Information should include</p><ol><li>Date of the physician assessment</li><li>Dates of illness</li><li>Level of incapacitation, and</li><li>Whether the diagnosis was made by the physician or based on description by the student.</li></ol><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>A ‘severe’ incapacitation indicates students are unable to attend class and engage in most academic studies during the period indicated. If they attend classes/labs, submit assignments/reports or write tests/exams during this period, they are at risk of being accused of ‘misrepresentation’; a Policy 71 academic offence, which carries a penalty that may include a suspension. </p><p>A ‘moderate’ incapacitation may or may not be accommodated (the instructor decides). Students should be aware that: </p><ol><li>They should consider not writing tests/exams during the incapacitation period</li><li>Misrepresentation allegations will not normally be issued if a student participates in other course elements such as assignments, quizzes, labs, and lecture attendance/participation during the incapacitation period</li></ol><h3><strong>UW policy on academic integrity</strong></h3><p>To create and promote a culture of academic integrity, the behavior of all members of the University of Waterloo should be based on honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.</p><p>“Note on avoidance of academic offences: All students registered in the courses of the Faculty of Science are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offences, and to take responsibility for their actions. When the commission of an offence is established, disciplinary penalties will be imposed in accord with Policy #71 (Student Academic Discipline). For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students are directed to consult Policy #71 (<u>http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm</u>). If you need help in learning what constitutes an academic offence; how to avoid offences such as plagiarism, cheating, and double submission; how to follow appropriate rules with respect to “group work” and collaboration; or if you need clarification of aspects of the discipline policy, ask your TA and/or your course instructor for guidance. Other resources regarding the discipline policy are your academic advisor and the Undergraduate Associate Dean.”</p><h3><strong>Additional information and tips for success</strong></h3><ul><li>Ask questions in class – this is a great way to clarify concepts in a timely manner.</li><li>The <strong><u>Discussion board</u></strong> is another venue in which you can ask and answer class-related questions. Students are encouraged to try to answer each others posted questions – this helps students formulate answers to content-related questions. To allow for this type of peer learning, the instructors will answer questions on the discussion board within 72 hours. Questions of a personal nature should be directed to the instructors via e-mail. Posting of spam messages/content, non-course related material/questions, or harassment of any kind will NOT BE TOLERATED (see policies above).</li><li><strong>Classroom protocol: </strong>Laptops can be distracting to those around you. We ask that those who require the use of a laptop only use their laptops for the purpose of classroom activities (i.e. taking notes) and sit in the “laptop” zone of the classroom (on the left side of the classroom or as directed by the instructor).</li><li>This course is challenging and requires the synthesis of concepts from several previous biology courses: Physiology, Genetics Cell Biology, Molecular Biology and Microbiology – it is not equivalent to a first or second year introductory course. Immunology also requires integration of separate concepts and builds rapidly on material covered in previous lectures. Therefore, students should be sensible in the way they approach the course – deal with problems as they arise and don’t leave things to be caught up a day or two before the exam. <i><strong>It is imperative that you attend every lecture and keep up with the text readings or you will find you are quickly lost.</strong></i></li></ul><p> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
