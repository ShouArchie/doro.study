<p><strong>LECTURE COMPONENT:</strong></p><p>Our BIOL-331 course for Winter 2025 will be a flipped course. All lectures will be pre-posted as power-point slides with accompanying screencasts (i.e., videos). The power-point slides and videos will cover important content and follow along with the posted textbook (i.e., MBoC) chapters and readings. </p><p>With our flipped course design, it is expected that students will the cover course content in the posted slides and videos independently and on their own during our Thursday at 10am class time. Student in-person attendance is not required. I will be fully available to all of you during that time. We may not always cover the content on every single page within a given chapter. Instead of posting page numbers, I have created a list of topics that will be covered in each slide-set. The list of topics roughly aligns with the headings and sub-headings within the textbook chapters. In addition, through my teaching, there is an emphasis on figures, images, and diagrams. Thus, another way to align the slides with the readings is by navigating to the figures and accompanying text. If there is content in the textbook chapter that we do not touch upon at all, it will not appear in your assessments.  </p><p>During our Tuesday at 10am class time together, we will meet on-campus and in-person all together to go over the content, review major concepts, work through questions, and students can apply understanding through problems. This course design is intended to encourage and promote student engagement and active learning with the goal to move students away from memorization. </p><p>For every hour of lecture time, you can expect to spend 1-2 additional hours reviewing and reading. This course is, by its very nature, content-heavy – it covers a lot of material. In many cases you are learning entirely new concepts, which includes learning the language of cell biology. If you concentrate on concepts and the experimental approaches used to understand them, then the myriad of new terms will seem less onerous.  We cover roughly a chapter of MBoC per week, so it is important to start reading the text from the start. The text is an extremely important learning support – and likely to be a life-long reference source, regardless of whether you become a scientist or not. Please make sure you are reading the textbook.</p><p>The week prior to either of the midterms will (of necessity) be accompanied by an increased workload for BIOL 331.</p><p>I would strongly urge you to attend our Tuesday class as often as you are able, because there is great benefit in receiving information in multiple  different ways, and from interacting with your peers.</p><p><strong>Quizzes</strong></p><p>Students will be assessed on their knowledge and comprehension of course content through a series of quizzes. The content covered and the questions will focus on the content covered in the slides with content from the readings designed to supplement student understanding. Students are expected to abide by the honor system to complete these quizzes independently. The purpose of these quizzes is for students to ‘self-check’ their understanding of the course material. </p><p>The online quizzes will be administered through the course website. Questions will predominantly be in the format of multiple-choice, or other Quick answer questions. There will not be any written or essay questions for the quizzes. Quizzes will open on the date specified in the course schedule and remain open until Friday at 11:59pm. Students can complete the quiz at any point during that time-period, but once the quiz is started, students will only have 20-minutes to complete the quiz. There are 9 quizzes for you to complete, but only 7 are used for your grade calculation, which means that you can miss 2 quizzes.</p><p><strong>Midterm and Final Exam</strong></p><p>We have two midterms scheduled for this term. Both are scheduled as in-person, on-campus midterms on a Thursday. </p><p>For the two midterms and the final exam, the format will include multiple choice, true or false, and short-answer (single and multi-part) questions. The second midterm and the final exam will be cumulative. The exams will primarily test your understanding of concepts and not your ability to memorize, but given the nature of the topics, some memorization is inevitable. In addition to weekly office hours, I will hold extended office hours before exams.</p><p>Graded midterms will be available for viewing during fixed “exam viewing hours” which will be announced around the same time as the midterm marks are posted. Midterms can be re-graded upon request, but this will involve re-grading the whole midterm and may result in either an increase or a decrease of the grade. There will be no provision to view final exam papers. You are encouraged to get in touch via email with any grading concerns. </p><p><strong>LAB COMPONENT:</strong></p><p><strong>Important note</strong>: Due to the nature of the experiments performed in this lab, laboratory section changes are not possible for this course. You must attend the assigned laboratory section since your samples cannot “travel” with you to another section.</p><p>There is no printed lab manual to purchase for this course, but the necessary laboratory information will either be posted on Learn or given to you by your TAs (through email or via Teams). The labs focus on the use of yeast as a model system for understanding mitochondrial biogenesis and will feature subcellular fractionation and the use of different assays for identification and characterization of isolated mitochondria.</p><p><strong>There is no final laboratory report.</strong> Instead, there are 5 lab assignments, each is worth 3% of your final grade (total of 15%). There is also a final lab exam (5%), laboratory notebook (3%) and subjective lab mark (2%). The late penalty for all assignment submissions will be 5% per day, for up to 7 days, after which you will no longer be able to submit your (late) assignment. </p><p>Laboratories are important in biology and all students need to develop certain laboratory skills, recording keeping of your data, experimental observations and methods are some of those skills. You will have to have a <strong>separate lab book</strong> in which you will record the experimental steps you performed and any possible comments on what you did differently from the written protocol that may or may not influence your results. The teaching assistants will check your lab book periodically and/or at the end of the term. <strong>The</strong> <strong>mark for your lab book is worth 3% of the final grade</strong>. Please purchase a green biology lab book (or an alternative soft cover, not spiral bound notebook) from W store.</p><p>A <strong>subjective mark (2% of the final grade)</strong> will reflect your <strong>activities in the lab</strong>. The TAs will monitor if you are arriving in the lab on time, if you are leaving early without finishing your work, if you are doing your own work or observing your partners work etc. Being prepared for the lab, having your flowchart and any calculations ready will also be part of your subjective mark as is your professional conduct in the lab and adhering to lab safety rules. <strong>For this lab, having a flowchart ready is mandatory to enter the lab. </strong></p><p><strong>Please note: You must pass the lab component in order to pass the course.</strong></p>

If the assessment was missed due to illness or another valid, documentable reason, you <u>may</u> be granted accommodation through the following process:</p><p>Contact your instructor within 24 hours of the missed assessment. Accommodations for missed assessments will <u>not</u> be granted if you do not make contact via email.</p><p>Follow the information posted in the Faculty of Science Accommodation for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances website (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances</a>)</p><p><i>Student travel plans </i>are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time (see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations">https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations</a>).</p><p>The weight of the missed midterm will be added to the final exam weight once proper documentation has been submitted.  There are <u>no make-up</u> or alternative term tests. </p><p>Note that filing documentation with the Science Undergrad office/Quest does NOT automatically excuse the missing of a test/assignment. The course instructor will consider the information provided on the documentation when deciding whether a student should be excused. Students should carefully consider the wisdom of missing an assessment.</p>

  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>Our in-person and on-campus lectures will be live and in-person without being recorded. Audio and video recording of lectures is strictly prohibited. This will allow for a more natural and dynamic learning atmosphere with a welcome environment for student comments, questions, and participation. In the event that activities for this course may involve recording, in partial fulfillment of the course learning outcomes, you will receive notification of recording via at least one of the following mechanisms: within the Learning Management System (LEARN), a message from your course instructor, course syllabus/website, or other means. Some technologies may also provide a recording indicator. Images, audio, text/chat messaging that may have been recorded may be used and/or made available by the University to all undergraduate students enrolled in our course for the purpose of reviewing course content. Recordings will be managed according to the University records classification scheme, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/records-management/records-classification-and-retention-schedules"><u>WatClass</u></a>, and will be securely destroyed when no longer needed by the University. Your personal information is protected in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31"><u>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</u></a>, as well as <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/privacy"><u>University policies and guidelines</u></a> and may be subject to disclosure where required by law.</p><p>The University will use reasonable means to protect the security and confidentiality of the recorded information, but cannot provide a guarantee of such due to factors beyond the University’s control, such as recordings being forwarded, copied, intercepted, circulated, disclosed, or stored without the University’s knowledge or permission or the introduction of malware into computer system which could potentially damage or disrupt the computer, networks, and security settings. The University is not responsible for connectivity/technical difficulties or loss of data associated with your hardware, software or Internet connection.</p><p>By engaging in course activities that involve recording, you are consenting to the use of your appearance, image, text/chat messaging, and voice and/or likeness in the manner and under the conditions specified herein. (In the case of a live stream event, if you choose not to have your image or audio recorded, you may <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-it-services/"><u>disable the audio and video functionality</u></a>(see: Student privacy during live events). Instructions to participate using a pseudonym instead of your real name are included where the feature exists; however, you must disclose the pseudonym to your instructor in advance in order to facilitate class participation.). If you choose not to be recorded, this notice serves as confirmation of your understanding that all recordings will be posted to Learn for students to review as needed.</p><p>You are not permitted to disclose the link to/URL of an event or an event session recording or copies of recording to anyone, for any reason. Recordings are available only to authorized individuals who have been directly provided the above instructions/link for their use. Recordings for personal use, required to facilitate your learning and preparation of personal course/lecture notes, should not be shared with others without the permission of the instructor or event coordinator.

<p><strong>Generative AI</strong></p><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot in teaching, learning, and education is still evolving and changing. In our class, we will discuss the expectations surrounding gen-AI.</p><p>Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of ation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
