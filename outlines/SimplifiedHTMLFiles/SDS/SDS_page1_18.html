<p>WALLS TO BRIDGES</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><p> </p><p><i><strong>“W2B is a community who grows through circle work and sharing lived experiences to gather knowledge not only found in textbooks.   </strong></i></p><p><i><strong>Grand Valley Institution Collective, 2018</strong></i></p><p> </p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Walls to Bridges (W2B) is an innovative educational program that brings together incarcerated (“inside”) and non-incarcerated (“outside”) students to study university and college level courses in jails and prisons across Canada.  The National Hub for the program is based out of the Lyle S. Hallman Faculty of Social Work, in partnership with Grand Valley Institution for Women in Kitchener. </p><p> </p><p>Flexibility is key. There are readings and activities planned but the syllabus may shift in response to the class community. Students who take Walls to Bridges courses must be open to these shifts, new ways of learning, and being prepared to challenge themselves intellectually and emotionally. The course creates a space for various perspectives to emerge and encourages an examination of how we have come to understand concepts, what personal and educational influences we bring to the discussions, and how our perspectives can expand and change depending upon new understandings and collective learning.</p><p><strong>Experiential Learning</strong></p><p> </p><p>Experiential learning is foundational to the W2B teaching and learning process. An important principle of all W2B courses is that students from outside the correctional system are not ‘mentoring’ or ‘helping’ or ‘working with’ incarcerated/criminalized students. All participants in the class are peers, learning the class content together through innovative, experiential, and dialogical processes. Self-reflexivity is a key component of W2B classes. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Circle Learning</strong></p><p> </p><p>Walls to Bridges classes do not follow traditional “lecture-style” formats. Instead, we draw on Indigenous pedagogies and your engagement in the class will draw primarily from sharing circles, small group discussions, and experiential group activities. </p><p> </p><p>Classes will move along with your learning style as much as possible. We ask that you “trust the process” and join the circle even if you are initially feeling shy or anxious about this type of learning. </p><h2> </h2><h2>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h2><h2>SDS 240R – ART &amp; SOCIETY</h2><h2>Art has the power to change. This course explores the way that people use art to express an experience, to imagine new ways of living, and to call on others to take action.  This course explores art created both inside and outside of the prison system that seeks to propose new and more justice ways of living.  We will explore poetry, song, visual art, writing, and various other forms of expression, while also creating and constructing our own artistic expressions that speak to the themes of the course.  Class time includes dynamic group activities that creatively explore class material. The course wraps up with group project presentations and a closing celebration.</h2><h2> </h2><h2>Pedagogy</h2><p>This course is developed under the premise that <strong>knowledge </strong>is created and generated in multiple ways (i.e. through oral traditions, land-based traditions, lived experiences, spirituality &amp; ceremony, scientific &amp; academic research, etc.) and that we must resist the colonialist limits of Western ontologies that delegitimize other ways of knowing and being. </p><p> </p><p>Your lived <strong>experience and interactions</strong> with other humans, non-human beings, and the earth are foundational to engaging with the course materials.  This engagement could be rooted in the communities in which you have developed relationships (i.e. work, family, social organizations, activist groups, ethnocultural and/or religious communities, recreational/artistic/sporting communities, etc.).  It might also develop through active engagement in social movements/groups that you have identified as being of particular interest to you in this course. </p><p> </p><p>While this is a space of learning, it is also a space that seeks to <strong>resist</strong> the structures of oppression that permeate our day-to-day interactions. As such, I urge all students to be <strong>self-reflexive</strong> about behaviours or comments that have been identified as patriarchal, misogynist, classist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, et cetera.  This self-reflection <strong>applies to me as well</strong>. We are all in a process of learning and unlearning these logics that dominate our society, so there is no expectation here that anyone is self-actualized and perfect – all I ask is that you are mindful of how what you think, say and/or the way in which you interact with others is circumscribed by these forces. </p><h2> </h2><h2> </h2><p> </p>

You may choose to create a comic, a zine, or some combination of comic and zine.  Based on the “DIY” (Do-It-Yourself) ethos of this type of artform, I encourage you to decide the style, form, and content of your comic or zine. Don’t worry if you don’t think you’re “artistic,” I want you to explore various ways of expressing ideas and it's ok if some of it looks a little “rough” and “amateur”! Let yourself be creative! </p><p><u>Activity Instructions</u></p><ol><li>You will create either a comic, a zine, or a combination comic and zine. <ol><li>A full comic submission should contain multiple panels and span roughly 4 pages (or a reasonable equivalent based on paper size and format). </li><li>A full zine submission should contain different forms of media (i.e. writing, images, poetry, art, etc.) and span roughly 6 pages (or a reasonable equivalent based on paper size and format)</li><li>A combined zine and comic submission should contain different forms of media  (i.e. writing, images, poetry, art, etc.)  – including a single or multiple smaller comic items – and span roughly 6 pages pages (or a reasonable equivalent based on paper size and format)</li></ol></li><li>You may chose to create a comic/zine that is based on personal reflection, confessional/introspective, informative, theoretical, comical, political, or literary (i.e. filled with fictional stories). </li><li>You should base your themes loosely around readings/course activities from Weeks 3-5, this includes the poems in week 3, the reading by Alison Chang and graphic essay by Frankie Noone in  week 4, and the readings by Saidiya Hartman  and Alison Piepmeier in week 5. You could also base your themes loosely around the core “thematic” for reach week: repair, manifestation, encounter. </li></ol><ul><li>- </li></ul><p><i>Stuck for ideas? Here are some prompts that might help you get unstuck!</i></p><ul><li>-</li></ul><p><u>Concept Prompts Based on Readings</u></p><ul><li>The poems in Nayyirah Waheed’s, <i>Salt, </i>deal with both personal and social harm – your comic/zine might investigate harm and repair as both an interpersonal and collective process. </li><li>Billy-Ray Bel court’s “Gay Incantations” exclaims “grieve is the name I give to myself” and “it hurts to be a story” – your comic/zine might investigate how we might process grief and the stories that haunt our life.</li><li>Mercedes Eng’s “Chinatown Public Safety” is a list of things the poet suggests would show care for her community. How might you create a comic/zine that imagines a world where care is central?</li><li>Alison Chang’s article “Prints in a Time of Political Madness” delves into the history of a radical political poster making collective. How might you tell the story of a social movement through posters and imagery? Or how the stories we tell about the societies we want to live in might be “manifested” into being?</li><li>Frankie Noone’s graphic essay “Conversations in the Dark” tells the story of the artist’s conversation with a love interest about residential schools and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada’s <i>Calls to Action</i>. How might you create a comic/zine that details or reflects on your own relationship to this process? </li><li>Saidiya Hartman’s “The Terrible Beauty of the Slum” tries to express how a place/space that outsides might consider dirty, dangerous, toxic, etc. contains so much beauty and possibility.  How might a comic/zine you create try to do something similar based on your own personal experience/encounter with a place/space/community that is often misunderstood or dismissed by the mainstream? </li><li>Alison Piepmeier’s “Pedagogy of Hope: Feminist Zines” talks about the importance of the radical imagination and the use of creative processes for movements for social change. How might you create a zine/comic that engages with questions of the radical imagination and the relationship between art and social change? </li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Critical Reading Reflections Assignments 30% </strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Part I Due:   February 27<sup>th</sup> (Weeks 2-5) – 15%</strong></p><p><strong>Part II Due:  March 13<sup>th</sup> (Weeks 6-8) – 15%</strong></p><p><u>Activity Instructions</u></p><p>After every class, write 1-2 paragraphs documenting your personal experience as well as your analysis of the course content. You’ll hand-in these reflections twice throughout the term. Use the following journal prompts to help you with your reflections (you can rotate these prompts and write your own if you wish):</p><ul><li>What is your relationship to today’s course content and your lived experience?</li><li>Choose a quote or a visual from today’s readings and explore what it means to you.</li><li>Has this week’s class changed how you think? If so, how?</li><li>How does this week’s readings/art relate to the corresponding theme (i.e. repair, manifestation, encounters, worldmaking, disruption, transformation)? </li><li>Explore a feeling you had in today’s class.</li><li>Discuss your experience engaging with the artistic forms for this week’s class. </li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Final Project 20% - Due April 3<sup>rd</sup>  </strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Write 3 double spaced pages about your final project topic, your experience working in your project group, and your final thoughts about the class. Research material for this paper includes course readings and final project materials co-developed with your project team. </p><p>These are some things you might want to touch on (you don’t have to touch on all of these questions):</p><p><strong>Concept – </strong>how did your group come up with the concept for your final project? How did you feel about this concept? What readings/ideas/experiences influenced the concept?</p><p><strong>Method – </strong>what artform(s) did your group decide to use in the final project? Why did you make these decisions? How do you feel about those choices?</p><p><strong>Process – </strong>how did your group decide how to complete the work? What pieces did you contribute to? What challenges did you or your group face in terms of trying to make this happen? How did you feel about the overall process?</p><p><strong>Collaboration – </strong>what was it like working with your group? What’s one thing that surprised you about working with your group members? What’s one thing that surprised you about yourself while working with your group members? How did decisions get made? Was there a moment where you felt like working collaboratively was challenging? How did the group work through that challenge? </p><p><strong>Experience – </strong>After presenting your project, how did you feel? What was the bond you built with your group members? How did the art you engaged in contribute to that relationship? </p><p> </p><p><strong>Participation 30% - Due April 3<sup>rd</sup> </strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Participation includes weekly involvement in all class activities. Marks for participation are achieved by coming to class weekly, having read the assigned materials, and participating in class activities. Participation marks are also given for the final project work and meeting your goals set out at the beginning of the course.</p><p>Participation includes both listening and speaking. Students will be provided with an opportunity to self-evaluate their own participation that reflects their ability and development to carefully listen to and consider of others’ points of view, engage in thoughtful and in-depth discussion, and demonstrate a willingness and ability to rethink one’s own ideas. </p><p>Active listening is a key component of participation that often goes unrecognized. It means that you must not only contribute to the discussion but know when it is appropriate for you to listen, to hear someone else out, and recognize who is speaking/who is not speaking and why. As the instructor, I hope to help the class to develop strategies to become better listeners and I expect that you hold me accountable to this principle as well. </p><p>Participation involves collectively creating a supportive learning environment. A supportive learning environment requires all of us to act on an awareness of our responsibilities to others in the class (particularly related to group and team work), our social location, and of the dynamics of group discussion (i.e., only one person speaks at a time, interrupting another speaker most often makes respectful discussion difficult, silence and reflection are necessary parts of learning and as important as speaking, all students should have somewhat equal “air time,” students have different styles of communication, etc.). </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Cell Phones, Laptops, Tablets etc: </strong>Cell phones, laptops, and tablets will not permitted in class. </p><p><strong>Absences and Lateness: </strong>Let your instructors know in advance if you will be absent from class. Please arrive at the Grand Valley Institution for Women between 5:30-5:45pm. Students arriving late will not be able to be admitted.</p><p><strong>Rejecting Late Marks as a Good Education Tool</strong>: We live in a world ruled by capitalist logics and the logics of punishment. This course rejects the role of academia in creating a docile and subservient working class.  That doesn’t mean that we are creating a system free of responsibilities, instead, I’m asking you to be both relational and accountable to me with regards to your educational needs and capacities. I will in turn work to be relational and accountable to you in terms of getting your grades back on time, responding to questions/your educational needs, and asking for more time if I need it too! </p><p>We’ve been living through heavy times. So many of us are going to school and juggling full-time work, childcare, parent care, and various mental and physical health issues.  We’ve been struggling to make time for joy and social events, for organizing in community, and taking time for rest – those are all important parts of our lives and we can’t relinquish them because we are in school. This course is also being taught in a carceral institution and those of us who are currently inside face conditions and a culture that is so opposed to this anti-punitive approach that we need to hold space in this classroom for care, trust, and mutual respect. </p><p>I don’t believe lateness means a lack of effort, laziness, or inability to manage one’s time properly – those are myths perpetrated to create the uber productive pressure we all suffer from. I tend to believe that the best learning outcomes are ones where students feel supported and have a structure and relationship with the course and instructor that is healthy and accountable. I have created deadlines as a means of facilitating your work over the term, but I can adjust them for folks within reason – to better facilitate your learning. For that reason, I ask that you communicate your needs with me, and I’ll try to be open and up front about my needs/capacities with you and the class in general. We’ll weave through this together.  </p><p><strong>Late Policies (with communication): </strong></p><ul><li>If you require more time on an assignment, <strong>please reach out to me before the deadline</strong> and we’ll negotiate an extension that works for both you and the teaching team. </li><li>If you are feeling overwhelmed by the workload in this course, <strong>please reach out to me</strong> and we’ll try to negotiate something that is more manageable for you and ensures that you complete critical parts of the course. </li><li> I <strong>do not require doctors’ notes (and also believe they are a form of disciplining the workforce)</strong>. </li><li>I also <strong>don’t need you to disclose the reasons </strong>you need extra time and/or support – but I’m happy to listen if it’s helpful to you. Sometimes it’s just good to express what’s happening in your life and I understand that. </li><li>Please contact me <strong>before the deadline </strong>to arrange alternatives to the syllabus! </li></ul><p><strong>Late Policies (without communication):</strong></p><p>To try to maintain a culture of respect and relationality, if I don’t hear from you before an assignment deadline and/or after I’ve reached out to you with a check-in email, we will follow the late assignment policies suggested by the university: </p><p>In this case late assignments will be accepted up to a week beyond the deadline at a penalty of 2% per day. After the fifth day late assignments will not be accepted for any reason except those outlined in the UW calendar (e.g. medical or family emergencies, or some other such event) and will receive a grade of 0. If an extension is granted, students are expected to submit their assignment at the agreed upon time and date, with the appropriate documentation.

Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.
