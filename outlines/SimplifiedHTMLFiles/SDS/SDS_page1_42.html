<p><strong>Class Participation</strong></p><p>As a seminar class, SDS 440R places high emphasis on attendance and participation.  By Tuesday morning each week (starting in Week 2), you will submit to the designated Dropbox on LEARN a list of 10 (or more) key points or critical questions that you have developed based on the assigned readings.  You will also submit two Class Participation Journals in a Dropbox on LEARN (1 - 1½ pages single-spaced) - by Feb. 14 and Apr. 4.  In both journals, you will indicate your goals in taking SDS 440R and which seminars you found most engaging.  In your first journal, describe a plan of action to improve your participation in the second half of the class.  In your second journal, comment on whether you were able to implement your plan of action and whether you achieved your goals from your first journal.  You will attach to your journal on Feb. 14 and Apr. 4 a copy of the Class Participation Rubric (to be provided on LEARN) - you will rate yourself based on your attendance, class preparation, listening skills, level of engagement, and quality of contribution to the discussions.  You will justify your rating with specific examples of your contribution to these discussions. </p><p><strong>Thought Papers</strong></p><p>You will submit two Thought Papers to the designated Dropbox online (1 ½ to 2 pages single-spaced).  Your first paper will be based on the assigned readings for either Jan. 21 or 28 (your choice) and your second paper will be based on the readings for either Mar. 4 or 11 (your choice).  You will be provided with topics for the Thought Papers in class.  Evaluation will be based on your ability to a) integrate information from the assigned readings and b) include your own critical reflection in applying this information to the posed question.</p><p><strong>Group Seminar Presentation</strong></p><p>On our course website, sign-up before class on Jan. 14th for one of the available seminar topics.  Selections will be made on a first-come, first-choice basis.  You and two of your peers will review the assigned readings for your seminar topic in addition to extending the discussion with your own review of relevant research.  Potential topics to explore include treatment options, education, prevention, and policy issues, and future areas of research.  You are also encouraged to discuss how COVID-19 impacted your topic.  Your seminar will include roughly 50 Power Point slides, including discussion topics (aim for roughly 2 hours of material).  Identify the student author for each slide in the footer.  On the Friday before your presentation, email Dr. Perretta 7 - 8 Discussion Questions.  Your presentation will include a variety of multimedia of your choice (e.g., video-clips with targeted questions, handouts, surveys, case studies, debates, songs, or poetry), which will highlight effective applications of your topic.  Evaluation will be based on your background knowledge, focus of presentation, effective use of a variety of media, presentation skills, generation of class discussion, and group participation.  Each student will provide a summary (1½ - 2 pages single-spaced) of the key points that you covered in your portion of the presentation, along with additional pages listing your own References.  You will also submit on LEARN the Group Participation Rubric (see LEARN website) – you will rate yourself and your peers on a number of dimensions including workload, organization, showing up for meetings and meeting deadlines.  I am happy to schedule a meeting with you and your group to discuss this project. </p><p><strong>Final Paper</strong></p><p>By April 7<sup>th</sup> you will submit a movie review (8-10 pages double-spaced, not including title page or references), in which you will explain how this movie demonstrates some of the principal characteristics and components of well-being and wellness.  Critically examine the concept of well-being from multiple perspectives (e.g., bio-psycho-social-spiritual) and <strong>apply relevant information from several seminars (5 or more)</strong>, assigned readings, and your own literature search (include a list of References).  Comment on some changes that you would make in order to demonstrate and apply course concepts/readings even more powerfully in the movie.  Sample movies to review include <i>The Wild Robot,</i> <i>Soul</i>, <i>Up,</i> <i>The Boy and the Heron</i>, <i>Moonlight, Everything Everywhere All At Once, The Farewell, Turning Red, Room, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i>, <i>Inside Out</i>, <i>Precious,</i> <i>Indian Horse</i>, <i>Coco,</i> <i>Shawshank Redemption</i>, or one of your choice.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Late or Incomplete Work</h4><p>Students should make every effort to submit their assignments on time. Late work will be deducted cumulatively at 10% each day that the assignment is late, including weekends. If a student anticipates a conflict with an assignment deadline or has concerns about completing the assignment, the student should contact the instructor as soon as possible once the realization is made.</p><h4>Coursework Submission Policy</h4><p>Dropboxes will be set up on LEARN to submit various assignments.  It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided if they wish to submit an alternate assignment.</p><h4>Electronic Device Policy</h4><p>Students who choose to use electronic devices to support their learning may do so provided that others are not disturbed or prohibited from their own learning. Electronic devices should be used for the purposes of supplementing the learning experience and focus on topics being discussed in class. Phones should be kept on silent during the class.</p><h4>Attendance Policy</h4><p>25% of your final grade will be based on your attendance and class participation.  Accommodation will be made for student illness or other unforeseen events.  </p><h4>Communication Policy</h4><p>Email, using the uWaterloo provided email address, is the approved method of communication for Renison. The Office 365 email that you use to login using your WatIAM login and password is secure and confidential. Take caution when forwarding your WatIAM email to an external email service as confidential information forwarded to a third-party provider could be a data security breach and violation of FIPPA (Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act) under which all students, staff, and faculty are bound by law.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as critical thinking and conducting a literature review. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes.

Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details.
