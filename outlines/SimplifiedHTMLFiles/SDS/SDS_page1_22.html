<p><strong>Module Review Exercises (Möbius)</strong></p><p>Eleven review exercises have been made available for you to complete in Möbius. These exercises provide an opportunity for you to test your understanding of the concepts covered in each module. There is no time limit on them, and you may take each review exercise as many times as you like—a slightly different version of the exercise will be available to you each time you complete it to give you ample opportunity to practice and test your skills in a particular module.</p><p>You will have access to the review exercises throughout the term and may complete them as often as you like to practice your skills and prepare for the online midterms and final exam.</p><p>Your best grades for each review exercise will be uploaded to LEARN at the end of the term. And only your top ten (out of eleven) exercises will be used for your final grade.</p><p><strong>Online Quizzes (Mobius) and SDS 250R Survey (LEARN) </strong></p><p>This activity consists of 12 online exercises. They comprise of the 11 quizzes listed on the Table of Contents and the<strong> SDS 250R Student Survey</strong>.  The best 10 out of 12 marks will be used for your final grade calculation.</p><p>The first step in the completion of the assignments involves data collection. These data will be supplied by the students registered in this course, through the <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=987163&amp;type=survey&amp;rCode=uWaterloo-435047"><strong>SDS 250R Student Survey</strong></a>. </p><p>The weekly quizzes are available on Mobius.  These quizzes are timed and can only be taken once.  </p><p><strong>Assignment 1</strong></p><p>This assignment is a group assignment (in groups of 2 or 3). You could choose your group members and self-enroll in a group. </p><p>At the end of the data collection period, the <strong>SDS 250R Student Survey</strong> will be closed and I will post the compiled data from the survey. These data will be presented in aggregate form only, so that individual responses cannot be identified. You will find this compiled data file posted as a <strong>News</strong> item on the <strong>Course Home</strong> page. Use these data to perform the tasks described below.</p><p>Identify one nominal variable and one interval/ratio variable of interest from the data set, and do the following:</p><ol><li>Create a frequency distribution table for each variable including relative frequencies, cumulative frequencies, and percentiles (only when appropriate and meaningful);</li><li>Create graphs to illustrate the distribution of each variable.</li><li>Write a paragraph that describes the findings including the relative frequencies, the shape of the distribution (when appropriate), the central tendency and the variability for each variable. Your grade will be based on the accuracy and completeness of your responses to these tasks.</li><li><strong>Order your work so that your results for the two variables are separate from each other</strong>. Your grade will be based on the accuracy and completeness of your responses to these tasks.</li></ol><p>With the assignment, the group will need to submit <strong>a brief group process report</strong> (describing how the group worked together and helped each other on the assignment). This report should be one or two paragraphs; no more than one page double spaced. Only one report is needed for each group and is mandatory for a grade to be assigned to the group. The report itself will not be graded. </p><p>Your submission should contain a title page with all group members' names, followed by the Group Process Report, and then the assignment.</p><p>In addition, each student will need to submit <strong>a brief individual reflection report</strong>.  The report should include two components: your contribution to this group project and your learning from this assignment. This report should be one or two paragraphs; no more than one page double spaced. The report itself will not be graded.  But the reflection report is mandatory for a grade to be assigned to each individual student.</p><p>Assignment 1 must be submitted online using Dropbox by the due date.</p><p>Your graded assignment will be returned to you online via the dropbox.</p><p><strong>Assignment 2</strong></p><p>This assignment is a group assignment (in groups of 2 or 3). You could choose your group members and self-enroll in a group. </p><p>The <strong>Study Social Hours</strong> file contains data from two variables collected from the class survey that you completed at the beginning of the term. I will post a <strong>News</strong> item when this file is available. Use these data to do the following:</p><ol><li>Create a scatter plot for these two variables with "Study Hours" as the Predictor variable (x) (make sure the axes are labelled properly).</li><li>Calculate the correlation coefficient for these two variables.</li><li>Calculate the regression equation for these two variables and show the regression line on the scatterplot.</li><li>Discuss the proportion of variance accounted for (r<sup>2</sup>)and the proportion of variable Not accounted for (1-r<sup>2</sup>).</li><li>Compare and comment on the size of Sy and Sy' (give numbers).</li></ol><p>With the assignment, the group will need to submit <strong>a brief group process report</strong> (describing how the group worked together and helped each other on the assignment). This report should be one or two paragraphs; no more than one page double spaced. Only one report is needed for each group and is mandatory for a grade to be assigned to the group. The report itself will not be graded. </p><p>Your submission should contain a title page with all group members' names, followed by the Group Process Report, and then the assignment.</p><p>In addition, each student will need to submit <strong>a brief individual reflection report</strong>.  The report should include two components: your contribution to this group project and your learning from this assignment. This report should be one or two paragraphs; no more than one page double spaced. The report itself will not be graded.  But the reflection report is mandatory for a grade to be assigned to each individual student.</p><p>A sample submission is available for you to review on Learn.</p><p>Assignment 2 must be submitted to Dropbox online <strong>in one Word file </strong>by the due date. </p><p>Your graded assignment will be returned to you online via the dropbox.</p><p><strong>Midterm and Final Exams</strong></p><p>All the exams in this course are <strong>open book</strong>.  However, students <strong>cannot bring any internet-enabled devices</strong>, such as phones or laptops, to the exam. Notes and calculators are allowed.  Students should also bring their textbooks to the exams so that they have access to the formulas and tables in their textbook (e.g., Z table, t table and ANOVA table etc).  </p>

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for written permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  It is also forbidden to share the material listed above from a previous iteration of a course with a student presently enrolled in the course, unless you have the instructor’s written permission to do so.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name</strong></p><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name and pronouns by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name and pronouns listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts.</p><p>Students can add their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information"><u>Quest</u></a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. </p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.
