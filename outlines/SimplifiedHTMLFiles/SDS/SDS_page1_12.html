  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Late Policy</h3><p>Please note, this course has been designed to create maximum flexibility with due dates and submissions. As such, late work will not be accepted without prior arrangements. Please reach out to the instructor as soon as you can if you are facing problems with completing required work.</p><h3>Generative AI</h3><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as collecting, synthesizing, analyzing, reflecting, and evaluating information as well as developing and practicing writing skills. Therefore, the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is <strong>not permitted in this class</strong>. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>Copyright Advisory Committee</u></a>.</p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>With gratitude, we acknowledge that Renison University College is located on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg, Hodinohsyó:ni, and Attawandaran (Neutral) Peoples, which is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes ten kilometres on each side of the Grand River from mouth to source. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place in all corners of our campus through research, learning, teaching, community building and outreach. We are guided by the work of our Reconciliation and Re-storying Steering Committee and Anti-Racism and Decolonization Spokescouncil, as well as the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous"><u>University of Waterloo’s Office of Indigenous Relations</u></a>.</p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.

Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
