<p>How do we define community engagement and what are its strategies? In this course, we will address this question by examining the importance of community engagement for individual, community and societal wellbeing. This course will introduce new ways to think about equity and participation in community, including key connections between theories and methods for engagement. Theoretical links will be covered, including theories of social change, collective impact, equity, social inclusion, and decolonization. Drawing on case examples from Waterloo Region, Canada, and around the world, this course will explore how research, services, and other elements of professional practice can be designed to stimulate community engagement and strengthen individual and community capacity. Through hands-on experience, students will apply their own knowledge and practical experience to course topics.</p>

<p><strong>Attendance and Participation (20%)</strong></p><p>Students are expected to prepare for each class by reading and thinking about the required materials in relation to their own experiences and observations in the community. Your participation mark is based on a combination of class attendance, participation during classes, participation in office hours, small group class discussions, and experiential learning activities.  Please see the rubric for a description of how attendance and participation will be assessed.</p><p><i>Experiential Learning Component </i></p><p>In this course, each student will engage in direct community experience so that they may relate the theory and practice themes we will be exploring in the course readings and discussions directly to lived experience. Every student is required to spend a minimum of 15 hours participating in some kind of community group, organization, project, or activity over the course of the semester (see LEARN announcements for a list of ideas for virtual engagement opportunities; we will also discuss opportunities during our first class). The majority of this experiential course component must take place early enough in the semester to provide sufficient opportunity for discussion and reflection during lecture and on assignments. You will be required to keep and submit a log of your hours (including activities you engaged in), and to provide contact information for a person who is capable of verifying your involvement. <strong>You are required to upload confirmation of your experiential hours [hours log and contact information] by April 1, 2025.</strong></p><p>There are many types of activities that are acceptable for this course, as long as you take part in something that involves intentional, collective action towards a shared goal or purpose. For example, you could volunteer for a local service organization or charity, organize a virtual event related to a cause that you care about, engage in social action in your neighbourhood, organize a fundraiser for a local organization, join a campus group, participate in a community theatre company, connect with programming and activities at your local library. Activities may take place within Renison or the University of Waterloo, however students are strongly encouraged to step outside of their comfort zone. Students who are already involved in community activities may be able to use that involvement toward this experiential learning component of the course. Please discuss this with your professor early in the semester.</p><p><strong>Weekly Quizzes (20%)</strong></p><p>Each Thursday, students will take an in-class quiz to test their comprehension of the assigned readings of that week. The quiz will be primarily multiple choice, true/false, and matching questions. Each quiz is worth 2% for a total of 20% of your overall grade. There will be 12 quizzes given in the semester, and only the top 10 marks will be counted. </p><p><strong>Assigned Reading Presentation (20%) </strong> </p><p>Each student will give one presentation in the semester. After the first class (Jan 7) a sign-up sheet will be posed on Learn, and students are expected to sign-up for one class. The presentations should be 8-10 minutes and delivered verbally, however students may bring in visual aids if they choose. If you are using PowerPoint or another presentation software, it should be emailed to the instructor prior to the class. Please see the rubric for a description of how the presentations will be assessed.       </p><ul><li>Presentation Time: 8-10 minutes</li><li>Q&amp;A Session: After the presentation, there will be a 5-minute question and answer session where the class may ask questions to the presenter about the assigned material.</li><li>Content to Include:<ul><li>Summary (50% of the grade): Provide a concise overview of the material assigned that day, covering the key concepts, findings, or arguments.</li><li>Analysis and Critique (50% of the grade): Analyze the material by evaluating its strengths and weaknesses. Discuss its relevance to the field, address any limitations, and propose possible improvements. Apply concepts from the material to real-life examples or contemporary issues to show its practical relevance.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>PhotoVoice (photos with titles) (10%) </strong></p><p>PhotoVoice is an arts-based method, whereby students will respond to a list of topics with their own original photos. In Week 4 (Jan 28 &amp; 30) the instructor will introduce arts-based community engagement and PhotoVoice to the class. Then, in class we will collaboratively identify a list of topics on community engagement and social development. Afterwards, <strong>each student has two weeks (due Feb 13 by 11:55pm) to submit 3 photos, each representing a different topic and abiding by the ethical protocols discussed in class. </strong>The photos can be taken at your place of experiential learning or inspired by it. Each photo submission should contain 1) the selected topic, 2) your own original title. The title should explain in a sentence or less what the photo means to you. Please see the rubric for a description of how the PhotoVoice submissions will be assessed.</p><p>The photos you submit will be viewed by the class. You have the option to attach your real name to your photos or a fake name (pseudonym) if you want to remain anonymous. If you want your photos to be anonymous, please add a pseudonym to your Learn DropBox submission, otherwise your real name will be used. Then, in class on February 27, we will look across all the photos to discuss themes and learnings. </p><p><strong>Final essay (30%)</strong></p><p>The overall objective of this assignment is to bring course themes and materials together with your own experience and observations towards a coherently structured essay about community engagement. In this assignment, students are challenged to use their experiences and observations of community engagement to illustrate or critique course readings and other materials, and to use the theory and ideas from class to critically reflect upon their community engagement experience. The essay requires you to search out and integrate additional community engagement literature and tools, where necessary, to support/enhance your perspective. Cite your references to course materials (including page numbers where relevant), using APA format (or another standardized writing and referencing system). The essay should include a brief overview of the context and activities of your 15-hour experiential learning activity, and then should explore a variety of themes and topics on community engagement (from the course readings and discussions) in relation to your experiential component. The final essay should be 2,000-2,500 words in length (not including title page or reference list). Please double space your essay and <strong>submit it via the dropbox (MSWord) no later than April 3 at 11:55pm. </strong></p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Turnitin.com: Text matching software (Turnitin®) will be used to screen the final essay in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
