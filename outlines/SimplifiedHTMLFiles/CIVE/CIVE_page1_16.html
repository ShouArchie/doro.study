<p>All team members will receive the same preliminary grade based on the above grading scheme. However, students will evaluate their team at the end of the term and this peer evaluation can increase or decrease an individual team member’s mark. The course instructors may also further adjust individual grades due to inappropriate actions and/or lack of engagement during the term.</p><h3>Deliverable 1a</h3><p>Proposal draft: Draft of design objectives, criteria and metrics, technical approach, task breakdown and schedule. This is important for comments and feedback.</p><h3>Deliverable 1b</h3><p>Proposal: overview of CIVE 400 Phase 1 design summary and changes, if any, design objectives, technical approach, task breakdown and scheduling, resources, budget and risk management.</p><h3>Deliverable 2</h3><p>Abstract &amp; Team Photo: project abstract and team picture for the Capstone Design Symposium.</p><h3>Deliverable 3</h3><p>Progress Report: succinct technical report presenting project progress, revisions and/or problems, remaining work.</p><h3>Deliverable 4</h3><p>Presentation at Capstone Symposium: presentation to peers and experts.</p><h3>Deliverable 5</h3><p>Client Design Report: detailed technical report of the final project design.</p><h3>Deliverable 6a</h3><p>Project Management Report &amp; Activities: actual versus planned, recommendations for improvement, identification of new learning and engineering tools.</p><h3>Deliverable 6b</h3><p>Peer and Self-Assessment.</p><h2>Meetings</h2><p>Three 15-minute meetings will be held during the term. These will focus on the communication of the progress on the project. Students missing a meeting without prior approval of the instructor and teammates will receive zero (0) for the meeting. More information on the meetings will be posted on LEARN.<br/>Groups are required to schedule a minimum of 3 meetings with their technical advisors over the course of the term (one per month).</p><h2>Expenses</h2><p>The Department of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering will contribute, up to a maximum of $60 per group, for capstone project-related expenses, during 4B, if needed.</p><p>Ideally, groups will submit one claim for all their expenses (including receipts) using the Excel-based form at: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/expenses">https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/expenses</a> (link to spreadsheet is at the end of the bullet “Contract employees (≤ 1 year), Visitors, and Undergraduate Students should use the following form:”)</p><p> </p><p>Receipts for any expenses are to be submitted to Lorraine Quast (<a href="mailto:lquast@uwaterloo.ca">lquast@uwaterloo.ca</a>)</p><p>In exceptional circumstances, additional funding maybe available if all capstone groups don’t use their allocated funds.
