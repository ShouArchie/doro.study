<p><strong><u>Assignments</u></strong></p><p>This course has three assignments that will be submitted to Crowdmark, and some questions may require submission of other file formats to LEARN. The assignment deadlines are listed on the Course Schedule. </p><p>Assignment late penalties are 10% for &lt;24 hours late, and 30% for &gt; 24 and &lt;48 hours late. Assignments <strong>over 48 hours late</strong> <strong>will not be accepted</strong>. Exceptions to this late policy are (1) an approved accommodation provided by the course instructor, or (2) students claiming their <i>grace days</i>. </p><p>Each student has two <i>grace days </i>to claim on assignment deadlines throughout the term. The student <strong>must</strong> <strong>send a short email</strong> to the instructor <strong>before </strong>the due date, copying the TA in the email, and expressing their intention to use their Grace Day. Each claimed grace day removes the late penalty for that day, but each assignment is still required to be submitted by the 48 hours after the deadline. Assignment solutions must be laid out properly, with all steps shown, answers clearly identified, and diagrams properly labeled. Uploads to Crowdmark must be of good quality, legible and properly organized. </p><p>Solutions using KENPAVE, AASHTOWare or a spreadsheet may require submission of the files or spreadsheet (this will be specified on the assignment). Teaching team assignment solutions will be posted on LEARN on the Mon morning after the due date (unless otherwise deemed necessary). </p><p>Crowdmark and DropBox (via Learn) will be mainly used to distribute and collect assignments. It is your responsibility to make sure that your work is properly uploaded by the deadline. <strong>Assignments are due by 5:00PM</strong> of the date indicated for each assignment. </p><p><strong><u>Term Project Case Study</u></strong></p><p>As part of the course work, a case study focusing on pavement design using AASHTOWare software and other tools will be defined as the term project to be done individually. A description of the term project will be provided separately on LEARN. The term project will be used as a means for assessment, to be done individually or small group of students <strong>(Maximum of two people)</strong>. These assessments will be delivered by and submitted to Dropbox. </p><p><strong><u>Final Exam</u></strong></p><p>   This course has a 2.5‐hour final <strong>closed book</strong> exam scheduled through the Office of Registrar's (TBA). As with assignments, uploaded solutions must be of good quality, legible and properly organized.   The final exam will be<strong> cumulative</strong>, including topics covered in the assignments and lectures. . <strong>You must pass the final exam to pass the course. As a results, a student who receives a grade lower than 50% in the final exam will get an overall grade of 49 or lower. </strong> More details on the topics covered, structure and allowable aids will be provided before the assessments.   </p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
