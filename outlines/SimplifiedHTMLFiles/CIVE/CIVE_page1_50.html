<p><strong>Assignments</strong></p><p>Two assignments will familiarize students with the tools of air quality engineering and analysis, with one focusing on mass balance modelling of indoor pollutants, and the second on the cost and benefits of engineering solutions.  </p><p><strong>Participation </strong></p><p>Students are encouraged to participate in class activities and discussions. Participation will be assessed as class attendance. Absences may be excused in advance for reasonable circumstances by alerting the instructor. Each unexcused absence can be made up with a 300-word summary of the missed lecture material, submitted by email to the course instructors, due within three days of the next class attended, or a 2.5% penalty is applied.</p><p><strong>Mini Quizzes</strong> <strong>for Required Readings</strong></p><p>Lectures build from key scientific literature in the area. Each lecture is associated with readings. These readings feature in-class discussions and take-home quizzes (short, online, open-notes). If a reading is marked with a †, you are responsible for preparing the paper(s) prior to class. We do not expect you to master the technical details, but we do expect you to come to class prepared to discuss the paper and its relevance to course concepts.</p><p><strong>Group / individual project </strong></p><p>The goal of the final project is to gain experience working with a topic related to the course concepts.  Multiple potential projects are permissible, so long as they relate to  course learning objectives as described above. For example, the project can use measurements, models, published data, or review scientific literature.  Students will meet with instructors throughout the term to develop their projects. </p><p>The project report should provide an abstract, introduction, problem statement /research question, literature review, methods, results, and discussion/conclusion. Rubrics will vary for undergraduates and graduate students. </p><p>Undergraduates may be encouraged to work in pairs. They will produce a report of approximately 3000 to 5000 words, exclusive of front matter, references, and appendices. </p><p>Course-based master’s students may elect to work in pairs or individually. Research-based graduate students should work independently and produce a manuscript in the style of a journal publication, with a length of approximately 5000 to 7000 words, excluding references and supporting material. </p><h2>Late Work:</h2><p>All course deliverables are due by the date and time specified on the handouts. Only an electronic version, in PDF format, should be submitted to the corresponding LEARN drop box or Crowdmark. Please check your file once uploaded to ensure all pages were uploaded correctly. Late assignments will receive a grade of zero. </p><p>Exceptions to this late policy are (1) an approved accommodation by the instructors, (2) students claiming their grace days. Each student gets four grace days to apply throughout the term. You can use no more than two days on a given assignment. Any assignment submitted more than 48 hours after the deadline will receive a grade of zero regardless of grace days. Grace days will be automatically applied based on the submission date of each assignment. The grace days cannot be used for the presentations. In the unlikely event that the LEARN or Crowdmark is down at the time of submission, please email the submission to the instructors at the email listed above.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.
