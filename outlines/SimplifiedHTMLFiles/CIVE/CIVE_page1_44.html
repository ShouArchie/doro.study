  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Student responsibilities</strong>: Students are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offences, and to take responsibility for their actions. Students who are unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who need help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about "rules" for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course professor, TA, academic advisor, or the Undergraduate Associate Dean. The <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">Office of Academic Integrity</a> at the University of Waterloo maintains a website with a number of items of interest to students. In particular the page on <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/integrity-waterloo-students">Academic Integrity for students</a> provides various examples as well as a <a href="http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/ait/">tutorial</a> on the subject. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 - Student Discipline.</a> For typical penalties see <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p><p> Specific student responsibilities for CIVE 680 are: </p><ul><li>Your behaviour must be respectful and professional in the lectures and tutorials.</li><li>You must complete the quizzes and exam as an individual using only the allowable aids.  Specific details on the rules and allowable aids will be given prior to the assessments.</li><li>Course materials are provided (including, but not limited to documents, videos and text communication) solely for your personal use in participating in the course. You are not permitted to share or distribute course materials in any format outside of the course, unless prior written permission is provided by the instructor.</li><li>The content of all assessments used in this course is confidential.  You are not permitted to release or discuss assessments outside of the course.  Only after the teaching team gives permission (e.g., after all assessments have been written), students can discuss the assessments with other students enrolled in the course this term.</li><li>You are responsible for knowing the course schedule, and must monitor LEARN for changes to the schedule and general announcements.</li><li>You are responsible for informing your instructor and/or the Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering department when you miss an assignment deadline or assessment due to illness or extenuating circumstances. Documentation may be required to provide accommodations.</li></ul><p><strong>Wellness support and contact information:</strong>  University can be a challenging environment and it is normal to need support from time-to-time. Campus Wellness services are available to students through counselling and health services. If you are struggling or need someone to talk to you, please reach out. To book an appointment or learn more about the services, call 519-888-4567 x 32655 or explore www.uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness. If you are experiencing a crisis and feel unable to cope and Campus Wellness is closed, contact any of these after-hours supports: EmpowerMe (1-833-628-5589), Good2Talk (1-866-925-5454) or Here 24/7 (1-844-437-3247). They are available at any time of the day or night to help.</p><p><strong>Compassionate consideration:</strong> If you are facing challenges that are affecting more than one course, please contact your Associate Chair or Director of your program. They will review your case and coordinate a reasonable and fair plan in consultation with appropriate others (for example: Instructors, Department Undergraduate Studies Committee, Chair, AccessAbility Services, Engineering Counselling services, Registrar's Office).</p><p><strong>Intellectual property: </strong>Be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof).</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides).</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the</p><p>instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights and academic integrity.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.</p><p><strong>Continuity plan - Fair contingencies for unforeseen circumstances: </strong>In the event of emergencies or highly unusual circumstances, the instructor will collaborate with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty. This may include modifying content delivery, course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines with due and fair notice to students. Substantial changes after the first week of classes require the approval of the Associate Dean, Undergraduate Studies.</p><p><strong>Use of GenAI and CIVE 680: </strong>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as problem-solving, mathematics, creativity, communication. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce problem solutions, text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of your work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources">Student Success Office</a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students">Writing and Communication Centre</a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students">AccessAbility Services</a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide">Library</a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>
