<p><strong>Midterms</strong></p><p>We will have two (2) midterms in this course. Each midterm will be held during class time and will last for 80 minutes of the scheduled class. Midterms will comprise a mixture of multiple choice, True/False, matching, and short answer questions.</p><p> </p><ul><li>Each midterm will be out of 50 marks and will be worth 30% of your final grade for a final overall total of 60% (i.e., 30% per midterm x 2 midterms = 60%)</li><li>Midterm 1 will focus on material covered in Week 1 through Week 5</li><li>Midterm 2 will focus on material covered in Week 6 through Week 11</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Annotated Bibliography </strong></p><p>An annotated bibliography is meant to be a concise summary of what a cited resource covers. You should provide the reader with a ‘why should I read this and what is it all about’ summary of each source that can be used to see what topics are covered in a particular source. To this end, your task for this assignment is to provide ten (10) annotated bibliographic entries related to the topic of your ‘Research Paper’ (i.e., this annotated bibliography will provide an initial foundation for you to build on in your ‘Research Paper’). Choose <strong>ONE </strong>citation style and stick with it. You can choose any citation style you like but only use one and make sure all details for readers to find the source are provided. The only caveat here is that <strong>none </strong>of the sources cited in this syllabus can be used in your annotated bibliography. </p><p> </p><ul><li>Each entry must be between 150 and 200 words written in 12 pt.

You are free to use whichever bibliography style you prefer, with the caveat that you must use a single, consistent style throughout and all details must be present (i.e., author(s); year of publication; title of article or chapter (if an edited volume); editors (if in an edited volume); title of book, journal, or publication (if an edited volume); volume number; pages; publisher and place of publication (if a book); DOI (if available.) For page ranges, please use an “en-dash” (–) rather than a hyphen (-), (i.e., 537–548 instead of 537-548). In Word you can insert an en-dash via Insert &gt; Advanced Symbol&gt; Special Characters &gt; En Dash. You can also assign the en-dash as a keyboard command, or you can simply search “en-dash,” on the internet and copy the symbol into your document for further use (though make sure it is an en-dash and not an em-dash or hyphen).</p><p> </p><ul><li>Your Research Paper must be between 3000–3500 words in length, including bibliography, written in 12 pt. Times New Roman font, using any uniform bibliography style. If you are uncertain about how many words are in a text and are using Microsoft Word, you can click Tools&gt;Word Count and refer to the value given for the ‘Words’ category.</li><li>Your Research Paper must conform to the <a href="https://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2guides/guides/tcdnstyl/index-eng.html?lang=eng&amp;lettr=chap_catlog&amp;page=../srchparbychap">Canadian style</a> (<a href="https://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2guides/guides/tcdnstyl/index-eng.html?lang=eng&amp;lettr=chap_catlog&amp;page=../srchparbychap">https://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2guides/guides/tcdnstyl/index-eng.html?lang=eng&amp;lettr=chap_catlog&amp;page=../srchparbychap</a>).</li><li>Research Paper topics will be selected during class time in the first class.</li><li>Late assignments, without prior discussion or valid rationale, will be assessed a deduction of 10% per day late and will not be accepted after ten (10) days past the submission deadline.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Participation in class will be of a great benefit for becoming familiar with the topics of this course.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as research writing syntheses. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p><h4>Held-with courses</h4><p>Please note that a held-with course will only count in the average for the subject code under which it has been taken, unless it is cross-listed with the subject code of its’ held-with course. For example, if a CLAS/HIST held-with course is taken under the CLAS subject code then it will count only in the CLAS major average, not the HIST major average. A held-with course will also only count towards program and breadth requirements of the subject code under which it is taken, unless it is cross-listed with the subject code of its’ held-with course.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system. The faculty and staff in Arts encourage students to seek out mental health support if they are needed.</p><p><strong>On campus supports</strong></p><p>For counselling (individual or group) reach out to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Campus Wellness and Counselling Services.</a> Counselling Services strives to provide a secure, supportive environment for students of all orientations and backgrounds.

Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. </p><p>Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information">Quest</a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p><p> </p><p><strong>University of Waterloo, Department of Anthropology, </strong></p><p><strong>Human Osteology Laboratory Rules</strong></p><p> </p><p>Your cooperation in preserving the skeletal materials, equipment, and laboratory facilities is always needed. Certain rules of conduct must be observed at all times in the lab. You are expected to behave as professionals. Failure to comply will result in the restriction or loss of laboratory privileges.</p><p> </p><p>1.         No disrespectful behaviour is acceptable in handling human remains.</p><p>            Handle bones carefully, using both hands to move large pieces and skulls.</p><p>            DO NOT make the skeleton talk.</p><p>            DO NOT put hats, glasses, jewelry, or any other objects on the skeletons.</p><p>            DO NOT make jokes about the dead.</p><p>            NO pushing, shoving, etc… in the lab</p><p> </p><p>2.         You MAY NOT open storage cabinets or handle skeletal materials and equipment unless it has been explicitly made available to you for study. This is a research lab as well as a teaching lab, and there are materials from a number of archaeological collections stored here. DO NOT mix bones from trays or boxes and return the bone to where you got it when you are finished.</p><p> </p><p>3.         There are numerous reference books available in the lab for your use. These are located on the shelves in the lab. Please DO NOT use any other reference materials without consulting the professor or T.A. No books, papers, or other references may be taken outside of the lab without permission of the professor.</p><p> </p><p>4.         <u>NO skeletal material or equipment may be taken out of the lab for any reason whatsoever at any time.</u></p><p> </p><p>5.         Despite the most careful handling, occasionally bones and teeth will break. If this happens, immediately inform the professor or T.A., so that the broken pieces can be repaired. Breaking something (except through inappropriate behaviour) will not get you into trouble: it is important to clearly and honestly relay what has happened and what has been broken.</p><p> </p><p>6.         All bags, books, etc. that are not necessary for your work in the lab should be placed under the tables or in the space indicated at the beginning of class. Under NO circumstances should they be placed on top of the lab counters or tables. Please also try not to track in mud or snow. The floors are only cleaned once a semester.</p><p> </p><p>7.         No food or drink, except water, is allowed in the lab. No food of any type should be brought into the lab. Attracting insects into the lab will result in damage to bones.</p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.
