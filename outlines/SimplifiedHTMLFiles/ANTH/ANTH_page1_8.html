  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ANTH 202:</div>
<p>This course introduces students to the history and key concepts of social and cultural anthropology through the examination of classic works as well as contemporary ethnographic texts and films. Topics include anthropological approaches to understanding cultural identity and difference, social structure, kinship, politics, and exchange.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>This course will introduce you to fundamental principles of social and cultural anthropology through the reading of ethnographic texts, supplementary materials and the study of films. It will teach you how to think about contemporary issues in the world through an anthropological focus on cultural diversity in space and time. While systematically exploring the everyday practices and values of diverse peoples in their social, cultural and environmental contexts, anthropologists do more than represent and translate exotic cultural practices around the world. They study human social life at the most macro of levels – as it manifests in governments, financial markets and massive corporations – and at the most intimate level of individual people, families, and small communities. <br/><br/>The goals for this course include ensuring that you learn a toolkit for critically analyzing, understanding, and reflecting upon inequality, power, violence, body, politics, and conflict as utterly interconnected in our globalized world. It will also help you question the taken-for-granted categories of differentiation such as race, sex, gender, kinship, ethnicity, and nationality. We will explore the diversity of factors that contribute to “structure” and “agency.” For, as much as we are all products of that nebulous concept we call culture, people also act in ways that defy social norms and values – even as they simultaneously reinforce them in other ways. Readings, lectures, and films will encourage you to reflect on current events through a new lens, and to question assumptions about humankind you always thought to be “true” – realizing how much of our own taken-for-granted world is itself culturally constructed. Drawing upon illustrations of family, economic, political, and religious systems from a variety of cultural contexts in the world, this course will introduce students to the anthropological approach to studying and understanding cultural diversity.<br/><br/> </p>

<p>Please note that we will read only four chapters from the book by Matthew Engelke and these are already available, along with the other two required books, on coursereserves as online and/or hardcopies. All other readings are available at coursereserves https://www.reserves.uwaterloo.ca/ares/. If you have difficulties accessing the course readings for any reason, please contact us and we will try our best to enable your access.</p><p>A note on the reading load: Expect to have a reading load of 40-60 pages per week, which will reflect the level of accessibility and ease of reading (this range doesn't include the graphic novel pages, which are generally easier and faster to read due to their visual storytelling and lower text density). If the reading load is around 60 pages, it will likely be because the level of accessibility makes it easier to read.</p>

<p><strong>In Class Participation (10%)</strong></p><p><strong>Date of Submission: Week 2-14</strong></p><p>Each class will combine lecture and discussion elements. Many will include interactive student activities (discussions, in-class writing activities, etc.) as well. None of these elements work unless you attend regularly and read the assigned materials. Please come to class ready to analyze and respond to the assigned readings, as well as to the contributions of your fellow students. Your active engagement in all of these exercises is essential. Please note that engagement includes attentive listening as much as speaking. Evaluation of participation will be based on the quality of what you contribute. <strong>Contributions to the discussion might involve answering a question posed by the instructor or fellow students, introducing a topic, examining assumptions, assessing the source and reliability of information and formulating new questions. They might also include statements of where you are confused or questions about the meaning of core concepts; questions about what the author is trying to communicate. </strong>Arriving late or departing early will affect your participation grade if they happen recurrently. At some point during each lecture, expect to be asked to write down your response to a content-related question in relation to the assigned reading for that lecture. The question may be in the fill-in-the blank or multiple-choice format and will most likely be a general question the theme or topic of the assigned chapter/article. This is to make sure that you do the readings before class time. Your overall performance in these exercises will count towards your participation mark. </p><p><strong>Online Discussion Question Posts</strong> <strong>(10%)</strong></p><p><strong>Date for submission: </strong>From Week 1 until the end of Week 12</p><p><strong>Breakdown: </strong></p><ul><li>Question points: 5% (0.5 points per question posted online)</li><li>Engagement points: 5% (0.25 points per response to question, 0.5 per week)</li></ul><p><u>Question points: </u>This course requires each student to submit a total of 10 discussion questions to Learn on the assigned reading(s) of the class before the start of the class. You can choose for which classes (of 19 classes in total) you wish to discuss the assigned reading(s), but <strong>you are required to submit 10 of these throughout the term</strong>. These should be thoughtful discussion questions not simply emotional/personal reactions to the reading. The objective of the assignment is to improve your skills in formulating good analytic questions. Therefore, <strong>the discussion question posts will be evaluated on quality and the originality of your engagement with the text, and not simply completion</strong>.</p><p><u>Engagement points</u>: On either of the 10 classes you choose for the term (out of 19 classes with assigned readings), you are expected to engage with two questions posed by your peers [these don't have to be on the same day/week you posted your own questions. Neither the questions nor the responses need to be longer than a couple of sentences. However, please note that I will try to go over at least some of these questions in class time and may ask you to elaborate on your responses.</p><p>In addition,  feel free to respond to more than two questions or 10 weeks. Anything beyond the minimum required will count as additional <strong>participation</strong> marks (especially if you feel not comfortable speaking in public). Even though these online responses <u>won’t count the same as in-class participation,</u> I will consider them while marking your overall participation. I recommend that those of you who may not feel as comfortable as others to speak in public make use of this option. </p><p><strong>Please note that there are no make-ups or late submission acceptance for the online posts, as they defeat the purpose of including them in class discussion. The rationale for this limitation is that you have the option of choosing the weeks in which to submit and if you leave all ten to the last weeks of the term and unable to submit one of these due to illness, this is your responsibility. I therefore highly recommend that you plan well in advance and spread out the submissions to allow for more flexibility for yourself and be able to have more options to submit when you cannot in certain weeks due to other assignments or unexpected circumstances. </strong></p><p><strong>Midterm Exam (20%)</strong></p><p>The exam will cover everything until the end of week 5 and will be a combination of short answer, multiple choice, and fill in the blank questions.</p><p><strong>Review Essay (20 %)</strong></p><p>In this essay, you will answer one or two questions that will derive mainly from Righteous Dopefiend. It will most likely require an engagement with supplementary course readings and films. </p><p><strong>Final Exam (40%)</strong></p><p>The exam will be cumulative and you will be responsible for everything that is covered in the readings, movies, lectures, presentations, and discussions. </p><p>The emphasis for your reading is not to master the specific details related to the data, but rather to read to understand the argument, contribution, and points of contrast among various perspectives on issues we will be discussing. It is also important to know the names of the significant anthropological figures you read for the course and their major contributions to the field in the areas covered in the course. You can use the PowerPoint Slides as guiding you on which figures and concepts to focus on while preparing for the exam </p><p><strong>Late Work </strong></p><p>If you turn a written assignment in late, your mark will be downgraded by 3% per day (including weekends). Feedback will not be provided on late papers.  </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory">CAUT Guide to Acknowledging Traditional Territory</a>.</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. </p><p>Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information">Quest</a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>The use of Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot,<strong> is not permitted in this class.</strong> Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.
