  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ANTH 100:</div>
<p>Anthropology aims at understanding what it is to be human and to examine how humanity is manifested in the diversity of cultures and societies across time and space. This course gives the student an overview of the breadth of anthropology and orients them toward thinking anthropologically in our shared worlds.</p>

<div>
<p>Are you human? Interesting. Do you want to learn a bit more about yourself and our species? I do. We’re such a dynamic and creative bunch, so it only makes sense to have a whole field devoted to us! Our class is going to cover a lot of interesting ground. We’ll be considering what it means to be human, both in the past and present, from various anthropological perspectives. Such perspectives will include: Biological Anthropology, the study of evolutionary trends and biological diversity among human and non-human primates; Archaeology, the study of past human activities using material remains; Linguistic Anthropology, the study of human languages and how they reproduce, transmit, and transform cultural practices and the power-dynamics inherent in them, and, Sociocultural Anthropology, the study of the lived-experience as well as social and cultural organization among groups of varying complexity. In seeking to understand the many facets of human experience from these perspectives, ANTH 100 provides scope for exploring contemporary issues confronting humanity, be they biological, environmental, technological, economic, or political in nature.</p><h3>Course Features</h3><p>There are 12 modules in this course. Students must complete all modules and the associated assessments. </p>

  Administrative Policy

<div>
<h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>As the instructor of this course, I’m just asking you—the students of this class—to seriously reflect on how important this land is to you. Just think about the opportunities you’ve been given here already (money, summer jobs, educational opportunities, houses, apartments, places to hang out with friends, places to buy food, places to walk around, the list goes on and on…); or the opportunities that you will have here in the future. The thing is, this isn’t exactly “our” land—and by “our” I mean non-Indigenous settlers. This particular land we’re on right now is called the Haldimand Tract, and it was actually promised to the Six Nations People who traditionally occupied this land historically. Through swindling and sleights of hand, they never received the full acerage they were promised (which was to be 950, 000 acres of land, but only 48, 000 was given back). So… just think about the Attawandaron (Neutral), Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee Peoples who once walked this land, and who still do—think about them and what they lost before enjoying the benefits (and there are a lot of them) this land will give to you and your families.</p><h3>Student Resources</h3><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>: Located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, provides academic support for University of Waterloo students who have both permanent and temporary disabilities. AccessAbility Services collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register at the beginning of each academic term.</p><h3>Components for Success</h3><p>Institutions of higher learning, such as the University of Waterloo, recognize that an effective education is one that repeatedly challenges the student while providing an opportunity for the student to learn to meet those challenges. Instructors strive to provide tests and examinations that discriminate among students according to their varying success in learning to meet and overcome respective challenges. This implies that these are integral components of a successful higher education: </p><ol><li>The most effective learning takes place through an active and constructive, rather than a passive, process. You are therefore obligated to do more than simply memorize information. You must study in order to fully comprehend the material presented.</li><li>You are responsible for and may be tested on any materials (including videos or other learning aids) as well as any material contained in the assigned readings.</li><li>You are expected to check the course Announcements page regularly for announcements concerning schedule changes, office hours, additional reference materials, answers to common questions, etc.</li></ol><h3>Late Penalties and Extensions</h3><p>Students are responsible for ensuring that assessments are submitted on time. Unless otherwise indicated, assessments that are not submitted properly by the due date listed in the course schedule will be penalized by 5% of the assessment total mark per 24-hour period to a maximum of 4 days. The late penalty begins immediately after the time that the assessment is due. After the 4-day maximum assessments will not be accepted and a grade of ‘zero’ will be recorded for the assessment.</p><p>For accommodations due to illness, please review the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?q=accommodations&amp;&amp;limit=20&amp;skip=0&amp;bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Accommodations</a> section of the Undergraduate Studies Academic Calendar follow the instructions provided.</p><p>For all other accommodations due to extenuating circumstances, a request for variance must be approved by the course instructor and are not automatic upon the presentation of acceptable documentation. If your request for variance is granted, the following accommodation practice will apply: </p><ul><li>Missed/Late Module Quiz:</li></ul><ol><li>If your request for variance is accepted the module quiz may be turned in up to 4 days late with no penalty and will be marked for a grade. After four days, you will receive a grade of zero unless you provide further documentation that the illness is ongoing.</li><li>If your request for variance is NOT accepted, late penalties will apply.</li></ol><ul><li>Missed/Late Online Midterm Exam: You must take an alternative online exam within 1 week of the missed Exam. Be warned that the alternative online exam is harder since you had extra time to study.</li><li>Missed/Late in Person Final Exam: See the University of Waterloo’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/academics/final-examinations">Final Examinations</a> page for further details.</li></ul><h3>Assignment Regrade</h3><p>If you believe that an error has been made in grading a course requirement, please contact the course instructor(s). </p><p>Students who believe they provided valid answers that have not been addressed by the TA (if there has been one assigned to this class) are invited to make a case to the instructor after an initial discussion with the TA. Please note that upon appeal, the instructor reserves the right to re-grade any portion of the submitted material. Hence, it is possible that an appeal may result in a lower grade. </p><h3>Generative AI</h3><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as explaining changes in human and non-human biology through time, major events in human history, investigation methods and techniques used by anthropologists, anthropological approaches to various cultural components and how those approaches aid in our understanding of contemporary and cultural social issues.. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">Copyright Advisory Committee</a>. </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources">Student Success Office</a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students">Writing and Communication Centre</a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students">AccessAbility Services</a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide">Library</a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>
