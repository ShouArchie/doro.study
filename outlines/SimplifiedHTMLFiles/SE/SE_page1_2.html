  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>SE 465:</div>
<p>Introduces students to systematic testing of software systems. Software verification, reviews, metrics, quality assurance, and prediction of software reliability and availability. Related management issues.</p>

<p>Engineering is about applying the appropriate amount of effort to make sure that systems work properly, especially systems that affect the public in some way.</p><p>In this course, as software engineering students, you will learn about tools and techniques that you can use to make your software systems fit-for-purpose. There is a spectrum of tools and techniques, from YOLO through to the techniques used on the Space Shuttle software. We are specifically going to learn about tools to write good automated test suites, other tools to improve software quality, and proving software correct (beyond what you learned in SE 212).</p><p>Topics to be covered include: testing and fuzzing related techniques, symbolic execution (static, dynamic, concolic) including operational semantics, constraint solving (SMT), automatic deductive verification, automatic invariant synthesis, and Software Model Checking. Formal logic is key to understanding the middle third of the content of this course and, although the course is nominally self-contained, you should be familiar with symbolic reasoning in general. In some ways, this course builds on what you've seen in SE 212, but using more advanced tools.</p>

<p>All assignments, quizzes, and tests that are submitted online will be returned online. Submissions will be by pushing to gitlab.</p><p><strong>Exams. </strong>I anticipate that the final exam will be in-person, and that quizzes will be in-class in-person, though there are no guarantees. All exams will be open-book, open-computer, no Internet (PDF viewers only). In what looks like the extremely unlikely event that we go to online instruction again, then quizzes will be take home, open book, closed internet. Each online test will be time limited and must be completed within 3 days. That is, you can pick the best time to take the test, but once you start, you have to finish within the given time limit.</p><p><strong>Lateness. </strong>Also known as “Grace Days”. You have three (3) days of lateness to use on submissions throughout the term. Each day you hand in something late consumes one of the days of lateness. Grace days are counted in units of whole days, so if you submit 2 hours late that’s 1 grace day, and if you submit 22 hours late that is still 1 grace day. We look at the last commit time in Gitlab on the default branch to determine when your code was submitted.</p><p>If you use too many grace days, here’s what happens. The fourth day of lateness causes your lowest assignment mark to be halved. The fifth day causes your lowest two assignment marks to be halved. If you have more than seven days of lateness, we’ll start converting marks to 0 and dropping the associated late days.</p><p>You don’t get any credit for unused late days.</p><p><strong>Group Work.</strong> You may discuss assignments with others, but we expect each of you to do each assignment independently. Acceptable collaboration includes discussing ideas and structures with others, as well as helping others debug their code. If your code is too close in structure to someone else's code, you are going to have a problem. The best way to avoid such problems is by (1) not sending your code around; and (2) not writing down anything beyond general notes (pseudocode) about other peoples' code. We will follow UW's Policy 71 if we discover any cases of plagiarism (and we have). Under this policy, the instructor may have follow-up conversations with individual students to ensure that the work submitted was completed on their own. Any follow-up may be conducted remotely (e.g., MS Teams, Skype, phone) or in person, depending on the situation.<br/><br/>We want to emphasize that we take the issue of plagiarism very seriously, and so does the University of Waterloo. If you are uncertain about this subject, please seek some guidance. There are many resources available to you. You can check the university policies, talk to the course instructor, ECE/SE undergrad office, et cetera.<br/><br/>Or, let's sum this up in two short instructions:<br/>1. Acknowledge the work of others. <br/>2. If you are uncertain, ask!</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Generative AI.</strong></p><p>The teaching team is keenly aware of the existence of generative AI (e.g., Github Copilot, ChatGPT) and how such tools can be used to write and test code. This is not a bad thing; IDEs, autocomplete, compilers, libraries, and tools like linters or Valgrind have existed for a long time and can all help you to write your code in an eﬃcient way by doing things for you that at one time you had to do manually. We know that banning them does not work (how could we check that, even?) and in reality (co‐op or full time employment), you’ll not only use these things, but might be less productive than your colleagues if you do not (but it depends on the tool!). So – we trust you to use these things responsibly. What does using generative AI responsibly mean?</p><p>Our asks on this are two simple things. The ﬁrst is that you should acknowledge if you used code given to you by an AI tool, just as you would if you found something on a website somewhere. The second thing is that you should use the tool(s) to help you, not do it all for you. This means you should understand the output it gives you and can verify that it is correct (remember that this is your professional responsibility under the law). Keep in mind that AI models are subject to “hallucinations” (making things up that aren’t true or aren’t real) and errors (bugs, vulnerabilities).</p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><p><strong>Piazza.</strong></p><p>Piazza is a great tool for collaboration and it allows rapid but asynchronous exchange of information. It almost goes without saying, but we ask you to be respectful and polite when communicating via this medium and to assume the best about others, as tone can be diﬃcult to interpret on a discussion forum.</p><p>Before posting your question, please consider whether this question can be answered by looking at either the course notes, lab manual, or documentation available on the internet (e.g., man pages). To help others ﬁnd answers later, (1) we discourage screenshot‐only posts (since the content does not show up in search results) and (2) we encourage you to please restrict a single thread to one question (or a closely‐related set of questions).</p><p>For the most part, we encourage (but do not require) you to make your question(s) public so that other students may beneﬁt from the answer. If something was non‐obvious or unclear to you, it was likely to others as well. If your question includes detailed design information or code excerpts related to a deliverable (e.g., an assignment), then please do make it a private question.</p><p>Please also keep in mind that course staﬀ may not be able to answer your question immediately as they have many other responsibilities throughout the term (and the frequency of questions tends to spike before due dates or exams). We encourage you to think through the problem before posting, but acknowledge that just like “rubber duck debugging” sometimes the act of writing down the nature of the problem provides insight into solving it.</p><p><strong>Re‐marking. </strong>If you believe that your grade on an assignment is incorrect, you may ask that it be re‐marked. To request that a question be re‐marked, you will need to submit your request in writing via e‐mail to the instructor.</p><p>When you submit your request, it should include the following: (1) your name and student ID number; (2) a clear indication of which question or part of the deliverable is to be re‐marked; and (3) an explanation of why you believe the grade assigned was incorrect.</p><p>Requests for re‐marking may be submitted any time before the ﬁnal exam. Be forewarned: when a deliverable is being re‐marked, your grade could go up, it could stay the same, or it could go down. You will be notiﬁed of the outcome.</p><p><strong>Extra Credit. </strong>In this class, there will be no opportunities to earn extra credit. Make‐up assignments or examinations will not be oﬀered under any circumstances.</p><p><strong>Attendance &amp; Illness. </strong>There are video lectures, but we can’t make you watch them. In fact, I [PL] don’t know whether I would actually watch all the hours of lectures if I was taking the class (I hate video). The lecture notes are the source material for the video lectures and also contain much of the information that we say. Thus, you have some options to choose the materials that work best for you. As you’ve surely noticed by now, at university, there is a lot that you have to learn on your own by doing assignments.</p><p>We do hope, though, that you stay on top of the material throughout the term and don’t try to cram it all before the ﬁnal exam/assignments. That’s why the assignment deadlines are spread throughout the term. </p><p>If you feel ill, you should seek appropriate medical attention. If you are feeling unwell during the exam, you should complete the self‐declaration of illness form or get a declaration of illness form signed. If you anticipate missing a deliverable deadline or an examination for a non‐medical reason, you should contact your instructor as soon as you are aware of the problem. Given suﬃcient notice, alternate arrangements may be possible. Alternate arrangements are rare and at instructor discretion. Still, we understand that emergencies happen, and pledge to be understanding.</p><p>If one of the instructors should be ill, we’ll either revert that section to online lectures only during the aﬀected period, or have the other instructor cover the lectures. We are certainly not going to show up while ill, and you should not either.</p><p><strong>Laptop and Device Policy. </strong>The human visual system has evolved to perceive saber‐toothed tigers in the savannah. Fortunately, tigers are rare in Waterloo, Ontario (Geese, on the other hand...). Unfortunately, your classmates are still human and hence their attention will be drawn to ﬂashing lights (or Tiktok, or movies, or video games) in their peripheral vision. We encourage everyone to be respectful of their classmates and to not distract them.</p><p>Wise use of computers and the Internet can be helpful for fully engaging in class. You might want to try out some syntax, or you might want to look up constructors, or you might want to verify your instructor’s somewhat outrageous‐sounding claim.</p><p>To support the beneﬁts of the Internet while reducing distractions, we will adopt the following policy for in‐person lectures in this class. We are asking that the ﬁrst 2 rows of class be text‐oriented: if using a device, use a command prompt or text editor, maximized to the whole screen. Paper is always good, of course. Mac OS X and UNIX command prompts are probably your best bet; for those of you on Windows, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux. From the command prompt, you can use compilers and text‐mode web browsers (w3m, lynx, links/elinks, etc....) tmux may also be helpful in managing multiple terminal sessions. Being proﬁcient with the terminal is a highly‐useful skill for a Software Engineer.</p><p>We acknowledge that lectures are not always engaging. Instead of distracting screen content, we recommend non‐distracting ways of tuning out, like doodling on paper (while taking notes), or doing homework. (we also recommend passing notes to each other instead of talking).</p><p>If you need to sit towards the front of the class and use a GUI program, then please discuss with your instructor to register yourself as an exception. If you sign up for the exception list, we’ll ask to you agree to not display games, videos, or social media on your screen (unless it is part of the class).</p><p>Enforcement is a sensitive issue, especially given the existence of exceptions. We are primarily asking each of you to respect the policy on your own. But, if you see someone with games, videos, or social media in the terminal zone, you can politely bring it up with them.</p><p>tl;dr: paper or text‐oriented programs in ﬁrst 2 rows of class during regular lectures (not in‐class exercises).</p><h4><strong>Faculty of Engineering Guiding Practices</strong></h4><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
