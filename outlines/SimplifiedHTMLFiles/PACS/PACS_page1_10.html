<h3>Context for PACS 202</h3><p>PACS 202 "Conflict Resolution" is one of the three introductory 200-level Core Courses in Peace and Conflict Studies. Although these three courses can be taken in any order, each builds on and adds to the foundation laid in the previous course. </p><ul><li>PACS 201, "Roots of Conflict, Violence and Peace," is designed to explore the reasons for violence and how it examines the various dynamics of human conflict, aggression, and war. This course presents a basic overview of the concepts of peace, conflict, and violence.</li><li>PACS 202, "Conflict Resolution," is designed to introduce students to the different theories and methods of conflict resolution, ranging from interpersonal to broader social and international conflicts that are utilized in a democratic civil society. An emphasis is given to negotiation, mediation, hybrids, arbitration, and adjudication.</li><li>PACS 203, "History of Peace Movement," examines how individuals and groups of persons working collectively have advanced the cause of peace in particular circumstances. Students enrolled in this class will study how the principles and practices analyzed in PACS 201 and 202 have been actualized by those who have been at the forefront of peace movements.</li></ul><h3>PACS 202 as an elective in other plans</h3><p>PACS 202 has been listed as an elective in five other academic plans. For more information about any of these plans, you should consult the undergraduate advisor for these programs. PACS is an elective for the following:</p><ul><li>Speech Communication Option</li><li>Human Resource Management, Minor, or Option</li><li>Four-Year General Legal Studies, Honours, Joint Honours, or Option</li><li>International Studies Option; and</li><li>Spirituality and Personal Development Option.</li></ul><p> </p>

<h3>Course Policies</h3><h4>Submission of written assignments</h4><p>Assignments must be submitted in one of the following types: Microsoft Word (DOC or DOCX) or Rich Text Format (RTF). No other formats will be accepted, and any other format will be deleted and deemed not submitted. Any submission by cut and paste into the comment section will be deleted even if the file is also uploaded and it will be deemed not to have been submitted.</p><p>Please adhere to the word limits. The word limits are hard limits. Markers will not read anything beyond the maximum limit. Papers that are shorter than the minimum will have points deducted. Adherence to the word limit is determined by the word count created by MS Word and displayed in the bar at the bottom.</p><h4>Assignment deadlines</h4><p>Late submissions of assignments will receive a 15% automatic penalty. The upload time recorded in LEARN will be used to determine whether an assignment is late. No late assignments will be accepted more than one week after the due date (unless a medical note is supplied). </p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.

Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website</a>. </p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. </p><p>Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information">Quest</a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as mediation. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>
