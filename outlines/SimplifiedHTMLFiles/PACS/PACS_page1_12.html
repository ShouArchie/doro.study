<div>PACS 326 / RS 380:</div>
<p>This course investigates the roles of religion and spirituality in peacemaking, exploring both obstacles and opportunities facing religious peace builders. Cases involving representatives of major world religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism) will provide a basis for comparing practices of faith-based advocacy for social justice, reconciliation, and coexistence.</p>

<p>“Religion and Peacebuilding” is a course about religion, conflict, spirituality, and peace. It wrestles with a paradox: for most religious people, all around the world, peace is understood to be an important principle of faith. Although the ways people from different religions envision and approach peace are not all the same, few would contest the idea that their religious precepts and practices are supposed to lead to peace. Yet conflict and indeed violence are also part of collective religious experiences, and each major religious community in the world has offered multiple (and sometimes highly contested) ways of seeking to realize precepts of peace and justice in a world with many conflicts and injustices.</p><p>PACS 326/RS 380 invites students to explore the diversity of human experiences with religion and peacebuilding, to reflect on their own convictions about spirituality, and to learn from peace scholars situated in several different religious traditions — scholars who are willing to wrestle with messy as well as hopeful aspects of communal faith histories. While acknowledging ways in which religious leaders and groups can contribute to fractiousness and injustice, the course focuses particular attention on faith-inspired individuals and movements that are actively seeking to advance social justice, conflict transformation, and peace in the contemporary world.</p><p>Throughout the term, we will seek answers to the following questions:</p><ul><li>Why does religious literacy matter for understanding contemporary peace, conflict, and justice issues? And how can awareness of religious dimensions of peace work help us to understand peacebuilding in global and multicultural contexts?</li><li>What are some basic teachings about peace in major world religions (e.g., Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Hinduism)? What is the role of interpretation? How do conceptions of peace differ within as well as between religions, and what are the practical implications?</li><li>How do distinctively religious perspectives on peace differ from and/or complement secular perspectives? To what extent do religious and spiritual understandings of peace and justice inform contemporary understandings of these terms?</li><li>If most religious traditions affirm peace as a social value and as an important condition of spiritual life, how is it that religious ideas and identities have sometimes been found to sharpen conflict or to provide cover for more mundane rivalries, prejudices, and ambitions? Why do religious individuals and communities often appear to fall short of their peace ideals? How does religion interact with other factors, such as economics, politics, social customs, or ethnic/national/racial identity, in contemporary conflict situations? Can the role religion may play in a conflict be transformed?</li><li>What types of visions and commitments are associated with religious peacebuilding and activism for social justice? What do peacebuilders from different traditions have in common?</li><li>What are some practical approaches to religious peacebuilding? Are there shared methods and organizational forms? What are some examples that illustrate the potential of religious peacebuilding, and how should it be evaluated?</li><li>What is the role of religion and spirituality in responses to pressing global problems such as war, environmental degradation, poverty, and human rights abuses? Can people with different convictions find common ground as they face such challenges? And what are some tasks for religious peacebuilders in our own communities?</li><li>What are your personal reflections on the role of religion and spirituality in peace work, as you consider the deeper sources of your interest in related topics?</li></ul><p> </p>

<h4><strong>10% Participation: </strong></h4><p>Ten percent of your final grade will be based on the quality of your active participation in class. Participation presupposes both attendance and preparation (i.e., <i>reading!</i>). It manifests through thoughtful engagement with discussions of readings and lecture topics, as well as through contributions to small-group activities. Failure to attend at least two thirds of all class sessions is likely to result in a loss of all participation points. </p><p>The framework for PACS 326/RS 380 participation acknowledges our lack of closure with the Covid-19 pandemic. Participation is graded because this is a seminar course and we can all learn much more when we are present together and engaged in a shared, term-long conversation. That said, absences caused by legitimate personal health complications can and do happen. <i><u>Please communicate actively</u> </i>with the instructor (in advance of absences whenever possible) about any issues that will affect your ability to attend class and participate.</p><h4><strong>5% Personal Background and Worldview Exercise: </strong></h4><p>Five percent of your grade will be based on a short, reflective essay (600-900 words) <i><strong>due by 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday, January 22. </strong></i>In this writing assignment you will reflect on your personal “relationship with religion and spirituality” and on how this relationship influences your thinking about roles of religion in conflict and peacemaking. The goal of the assignment is for you to explore the deeper background from which your assumptions, values, and perceptions emerge, so that you can link your personal ideas to formative experiences as well as to your larger family and/or community backgrounds. Additional guidelines for this assignment are posted in LEARN ("Outline and Assignments" folder).</p><h4><strong>15% Video Presentation Assignment: </strong></h4><p>Fifteen percent of your final grade will be derived from an application exercise in which you will create and upload a video presentation that <i>engages</i> <i>key themes</i> from the readings due <i>for a specific week</i> (each week there will be one or two students completing video presentations) by exploring a <i><strong>case</strong></i> that is of interest to you. You may complete this assignment <i><strong>individually</strong></i> or as a member of a <i><strong>small team</strong></i> of two students. Your presentation is <i>due in the appropriate LEARN dropbox before the Monday or Wednesday class session at which your presentation will be shared</i>.</p><p>The video presentation should be <u>appropriately timed</u> (<strong>a minimum of 4 to a maximum of 7 minutes </strong>for an individual presentation, or<strong> 6 to 10 minutes</strong> for a team presentation) and <u>substantively engaged</u> with key concepts or topics from the week’s assigned readings. Additional instructions for this assignment are posted in LEARN ("Outline and Assignments" folder).</p><h4><strong>40% Three Collections of Weekly Journal Entries (twelve entries total, four per collection):</strong> </h4><p>Forty percent of your final grade will be based on three collections of weekly journals. Writing a weekly journal provides you with an opportunity to develop a personal and intellectual response to the course experience that ties together major themes not only from <i>readings</i>, but also from <i>presentations, videos, lecture slides, discussions, assignments, and other relevant activities</i>. Be sure to go beyond mere summarization and offer carefully considered insights and reflections.<strong> </strong>Criteria for evaluation include <i>thoroughness</i> (integration of different readings and themes, responsiveness to presented material and the overall class experience),<i> thoughtfulness </i>(depth of analytical insight, critical engagement with multiple perspectives, creativity, ability to connect key concepts with personal experiences or world events), and <i>clarity of communication</i> (language usage, readability, mechanics). </p><p>Though weekly journal entries do not need to be entirely uniform in length, 400 to 600 words (about two double-spaced pages) is a good rule of thumb. Place all of your entries into one file and organize them chronologically. Please double-space, using 1-inch margins and a regular font size (e.g., 12 point). Here are some more specific details for the three journal collections:</p><ul><li>Upload the <u>first collection of journal entries</u> (#1 through #4) to the LEARN dropbox by 11:59 p.m. on <strong>Saturday, February 1</strong>. <i>Special instructions: </i>For Week 1, your entry is likely to be relatively short, but you can respond to the course plan and objectives as reflected in the syllabus, and to your experience of our first meeting. <i>Recommended length:</i> 1,600 to 2,400 words. <i>Weight:</i> 10%.</li><li>the <u>second collection of journal entries</u> (#5 through #8) is due in LEARN by 11:59 p.m. on <strong>Saturday, March 8</strong>. <i>Recommended length:</i> 1,600 to 2,400 words. <i>Weight:</i> 15%.</li><li>the <u>third and final collection of journal entries</u> (#9 through #12) is due in LEARN by 11:59 p.m. on <strong>Saturday, April 5</strong>.<i> Special instructions: </i>For your <u>Final Entry</u> at the end of the term please supplement your analytical and reflective statements about the course material/experience for that week with <i>overall comments</i> addressed to the term as a whole. <i>Recommended length:</i> 1,700 to 2,500 words. <i>Weight:</i> 15%.</li></ul><h4><strong>30% Take-Home Final Exam: </strong></h4><p>The term will conclude with a take-home final exam, consisting of short essay questions asking you to integrate and apply concepts from course readings and lectures. The expected length of submissions is 8-12 pages. <i><strong>Due by Monday, April 14.</strong></i></p><p> </p><h2>Grading Scale:</h2><figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Assigned Letter Grades</strong></th><th><strong>Percentage Range</strong></th><th><strong>Average Calculation Values</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A+ (for <i>exceptional</i> work)</td><td>90-100</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>85-89</td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>A-</td><td>80-84</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>B+</td><td>77-79</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>73-76</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>B-</td><td>70-72</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>C+</td><td>67-69</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>63-66</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>C-</td><td>60-62</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>D+</td><td>57-59</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>53-56</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>D-</td><td>50-52</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>F+</td><td>42-49</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>F</td><td>35-41</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>F-</td><td>0-34</td><td>32</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Late Policy:</h2><p>Deadlines matter. They keep us on track, enable us to be productive, and help us to meet our educational goals. There are times, however, when even the most organized and disciplined person faces difficult obstacles and unexpected challenges. If this happens, it is your responsibility to take the initiative and demonstrate commitment to getting the job done in a timely manner. <i>Students who contact Prof. Funk well in advance of a due date to discuss realistic complications that may postpone completion of work generally receive favourable consideration</i>.</p><p>A penalty will be applied to assignments that arrive late without prior clearance. The standard deductions for late work are as follows:</p><ul><li>One day to one week late: -5% </li><li>Eight days to two weeks late: -10%</li><li>Fifteen days to three weeks late: -15%</li><li>More than three weeks late: -20%</li></ul><p>Please do not make the mistake of failing to submit an assignment. The penalties for late work are not insignificant, but up until final exam time late truly is much better than never.</p>

<h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory">CAUT Guide to Acknowledging Traditional Territory</a>.</p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as collecting, synthesizing, and analyzing information; developing and practicing writing skills; and creative expression. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. </p><p>Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information">Quest</a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
