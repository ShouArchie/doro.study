<p>The course emphasis is on population biology, but examples from other areas are also covered. Students develop an intuition for describing the biological world in mathematical terms, by writing down and analyzing mathematical models of biological systems. Students also collaborate in team projects where they are required to construct, analyze and interpret models using mathematical software packages, and present their work to the class. Biology prerequisites are not necessary, but knowledge of differential equations and matrix algebra is required.  The course will be of interest to students from mathematics, biology, physics, engineering, environmental sciences, and anyone else with appropriate background.</p><p>Sampling of material offered: ecology (exponential growth models, logistic growth models, predator-prey dynamics, competition models); epidemiology (compartmental models of childhood infectious diseases, influenza); microbiology (slime mold growth; cell cycles); population genetics; and physiology. Model types will include ordinary differential equations, and simple partial differential equations. Techniques learned will include stability analysis of discrete-time models and ordinary differential equations, phase plane methods and qualitative solutions, travelling wave solutions of partial differential equations, and use of mathematical software for modelling.</p><p>The course is broken down into three parts based on technique:</p><p>I. Discrete Processes and Difference Equations. In some populations, dynamics can be broken down into discrete stages (for instance, insects that reproduce only during a particular time of year). In these cases, difference equations that describe time is a discrete way are appropriate models. We will discuss the theory of linear and nonlinear difference equations and their applications in biology.</p><p>II. Continuous Processes and Differential Equations. In other cases, a continuous description of time is appropriate (for instance, in human populations where individuals reproduce all year). In these cases, differential equations are needed. We will introduce the topic of ordinary differential equation models and their formulation and analysis in the context of biological problems.</p><p>In both parts I and II, we will emphasise how appropriate assumptions can simplify the biological problem, how important variables can be identified and how difference/differential equations can be tailored to describe the essential features of a biological process. After defining the problem and formulating a consistent set of equations, we will turn to the analysis of their solutions. We will discuss aspects of analysis such as phase-plane methods and qualitative solutions (steady states, stability analysis, oscillations).</p><p>III.  Introduction to Spatially Distributed Systems, Partial Differential Equations and Other Methodologies. Many microscopic or macroscopic biological processes are spatially distributed. In order to analyze them it is necessary to develop models that capture spatial structure of real populations. Partial differential equations can provide means for modeling spatially structured biological processes. We will briefly introduce these methodologies and demonstrate how they can be applied to study spatio-temporal dynamics of biological phenomena.  Time permitting, other methodologies will be covered. </p>

<p><strong>Tests</strong>: There will be three in-class tests. Calculators are permitted. Missed tests will receive a mark of zero without exception, unless there are medical or compassionate reasons. If a student misses a test for medical or compassionate reasons, no makeup test will be administered. Rather, the final exam will count for 49% in lieu of the missed test. </p><p><strong>Final Exam</strong>: The final exam will be comprehensive. Calculators are permitted.  </p><p><strong>Project</strong>:</p><p>Students will work in groups of 4 to construct, analyze and interpret a model of their own design. There will be both a written report and an oral presentation. A participation mark will also apply. Weeks 10 and 11 are devoted to project work but students are expected to work on it throughout the second part of the term. </p><p>Projects should provide background context from the scientific literature and pose questions to be addressed with the model. The project topic must be approved by the instructor, and should be relevant to biological systems. The project consists of a written component (worth 50 percent), an oral presentation (worth 30 percent) and a project outline to be submitted earlier in the term (worth 20 percent). </p><p>The proposal should be 1-2 pages and should include a proposed study system, cite and describe some background literature, propose research questions, describe general features of the model, and propose an approach to analysis. Structure of proposal should be paragraph form with appropriate subheadings. </p><p>The written portion of the project should be up to 10 pages in length (single spaced, 12-point font), excluding figures, tables and references. The written portion should have the structure of a scientific paper. In particular, it should contain: </p><p>• Abstract (less than 200 words). This should briefly summarize the motivation and methods and highlight the key results.</p><p>• Introduction: explaining background and motivating the problem of interest. There should be clearly stated research questions.</p><p>• Methods: explain the model equations and parameter values.</p><p>• Results: present the analysis of the model and explain how the results address the research question.</p><p>• Discussion: comment on what you have discovered and what research you think needs to be carried out in the future to make further progress on the</p><p>problem.</p><p>• References: list all papers, books, etc., that are mentioned in your paper (in some standard and uniform style). There should be at least 10 references.</p><p>I encourage you to discuss your project with me as you are working on it. I can suggest appropriate references, answer questions, and generally give you advice. I want to see that you are able to synthesize ideas from several references, as opposed to re-summarizing the information from a single reference.</p><p>The oral presentation should be about 10 minutes long and have the same structure as the paper. A participation mark will also be applied based on quality and quantity of participation in the project discussion. No participation in the discussion means a participation mark of zero.</p>
