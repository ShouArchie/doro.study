<p>This course will provide an introduction to mathematical techniques, including analytical, computational, and machine learning methods, used to study climate change. Course material will examine both historical evidence of climate change and future predictions related to climatological and societal impacts based on current models. The course will have a strong computational component, though there are no formal pre-requisites. Students will be, instead, provided with sample codes in Python and will be expected to make simple extensions to these codes and analyze the outputs within the context of in-class discussions and readings. </p>

<ul><li>The problem sets involve some analytical and mostly numerical exercises. You can hand in hard copies or submit them on LEARN, though the latter is most likely easier for the numerical exercises. If you choose to upload a scan of a handwritten copy, make sure it is legible: 400 dpi mini, and no pictures taken from a phone! I will count it as late until I receive a legible copy.</li><li>Late penalty: you lose 1/4 of your original mark per day of lateness. If you have extenuating circumstances, please come talk to me to get an extension. However, I am typically unable to give extensions that are longer than one week in order to be able to give feedback to other students in a timely manner.</li><li>I encourage you to discuss questions on the problem sets and to check that you got the same answer with other students. However, what you hand in must be your own work. <strong>Do not copy any part of someone else’s assignment</strong>. <strong>Do not copy solutions found from any source (e.g. websites).</strong> This is plagiarism and is a serious academic offense.</li><li>Current numerical exercises are based on the Python programming language and software packages. This is free open source software and is widely used in academia and industry. I recommend installing it using Anaconda (<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">https://www.anaconda.com/</a>; choose the option to install Python 3). Do not use Matlab! Course sample codes will be written in Python, so using Matlab for problem sets will make your life more difficult.</li><li>Weekly quizzes will be short (3-5 questions) in the beginning of class. They are meant for me to ensure that you are keeping up with the lectures.</li><li>Final project will have two parts. Specific rubrics will be provided.<ol><li>Analysis of a dataset of choice with relevance to climate change applying computational techniques or scientific principles learned in class.</li><li>Presentation (10-15 minutes) of the final project</li></ol></li></ul><p> </p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as numerical methods, machine learning techniques, and data analysis and interpretation. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
