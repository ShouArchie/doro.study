  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>AMATH 250:</div>
<p>Physical systems which lead to differential equations (examples include mechanical vibrations, population dynamics, and mixing processes). Dimensional analysis and dimensionless variables. Solving linear differential equations: first- and second-order scalar equations and first-order vector equations. Laplace transform methods of solving differential equations.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the course is to explore how first and second order differential equations (DEs) are used to model physical systems and predict their behaviour. In doing so we will develop, solve, and interpret:</p><ul><li>first order linear DE models of compartment problems, atomic decay, and bodies in motion;</li><li>first order separable DE models of population growth;</li><li>a first order exact DE model of the electric dipole;</li><li>second order linear DE models for oscillatory systems such as mass-spring-damper systems and electrical circuits;</li><li>second order nonlinear DE models for suspended cables and rocket motion;</li><li>linear vector DE models of multiple compartment problems and species interactions.</li></ul><p>Both analytical solution techniques and qualitative methods (direction field analysis, dimensional analysis, and phase portraits) will be presented as ways to gain information about system behaviour. We will investigate conditions for existence, uniqueness, and continuity of solutions of both first and second order initial value problems, and for systems in the plane. The method of Laplace transforms will permit solution of initial value problems with and without discontinuous input and impulsive input, along with convolution of functions. Maple will be used to generate numerical and graphical solutions, to illustrate concepts graphically, and to explore model behaviour.</p>

<h3>Course Policies</h3><p><strong>You must pass the in-person final exam to pass the course.</strong></p><h4>Late Submissions</h4><p>There is a late penalty of 1% per minute for the Online Quizzes.</p><p>Dropping the value of 1 quiz will ensure that a poor outcome during the term, due to illness or other personal issues, will not negatively affect your overall performance in the course.</p><h3>Assessment Guidelines</h3><h4>Quizzes and Midterm Exam</h4><ol><li>These assessments are timed take-home exams accessible on Crowdmark for 48 hours.</li><li>Once initiated, you'll have a specific time frame (<strong>60 minutes for quizzes and 120 minutes for the midterm exam</strong>) to complete and submit your solutions.</li><li>Exiting and re-entering the exam will not pause or reset the timer.</li><li>A penalty of 1% per MINUTE applies automatically after the timer expires or the due date passes (whichever comes first).</li></ol><h4>Assessment Conduct</h4><ol><li>You may use any materials from the AMATH 250 LEARN website.</li><li>However, seeking assistance from others or searching for answers online is strictly prohibited.</li><li>Non-graphing, non-programmable calculators are permissible.</li></ol><h4>Submission Instructions</h4><ol><li>Complete and sign the cover page for all assessments and upload it to Crowdmark.</li><li>You may print and sign the page or electronically sign it using your device.</li><li>Alternatively, write and sign the following statement affirming exam integrity:</li></ol><blockquote><p><i>I confirm that I will keep the content of this examination confidential. I confirm that I have not received any unauthorized assistance in preparing for or writing this examination.</i><br/><br/><i>Student Name and ID:</i><br/><i>Student Signature: </i></p></blockquote><h4>Communication Protocol</h4><p>If you have any urgent questions during the examination period, contact your instructor via email or post a private question on Piazza.</p><h4>Copyright Notice</h4><ol><li>All assessments are protected by copyright.</li><li>Reproduction or dissemination of these documents in any manner without express permission is strictly prohibited.</li></ol><h3>Faculty Policies</h3><h4>Calculator Regulation</h4><p>For the final exam, only calculators approved by the Faculty of Mathematics will be permitted. Please refer to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/calculator-regulation">Calculator Regulation</a> to see a list of approved calculators.</p><p>If you are unable to acquire one of these calculators, you must contact your instructor in the first week or two of the course so an equivalent alternative can be identified and added to the exam proctors' list of permitted aids.</p><h4>Mathematics INC Grade Criteria</h4><ol><li>An INC grade is awarded to students who have performed sufficiently in coursework during the term but were unable to complete end-of-term requirements (usually the final exam) due to uncontrollable reasons.</li><li>Request Considerations: Consult your instructor or an academic advisor if unable to finish a course due to issues earlier in the term.</li><li>Additional Information: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/incomplete-process">Mathematics INC Policy</a>.</li></ol><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as solving differential equations. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">Copyright Advisory Committee</a>.</p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources">Student Success Office</a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students">Writing and Communication Centre</a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students">AccessAbility Services</a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide">Library</a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.
