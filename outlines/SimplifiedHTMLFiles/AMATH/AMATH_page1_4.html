<p>As there aren't many books which cover everything comprehensively, prof. De Sterck developed this course note a while ago. This note includes all you need to learn in this course and has been a default reference for many years. It is available in print through W Store, and its digital version is available on the course website (LEARN). </p>

<p>The course grade will be based on 4 assignments,  a midterm examination and a final examination. </p><p>Assignments have two components: theoretical and computational. These components will have <strong>more or less</strong> the same weight, but not exactly equal. Theoretical questions will measure the learning outcomes related to the analytical aspects of the topics while computational questions are more focused on application and programming. The preferred programming language for this course is MATLAB (or its open source alternatives, Octave, SciLab, ...). While Python and Julia are also acceptable, they are not suggested. If you decide to use Python or Julia, we may not be able to give proper feedback -as some tools available in MATLAB are not available/accessible in these languages- and it is your responsibility to translate any template provided to whichever language you are using. Other programming languages will not be accepted. Students are expected to provide <strong>well commented code</strong> with the expectation that what a code is doing can be well understood (there will be a small number of marks for each coding programming question set aside for this). </p><p>Assignments will be posted on LEARN and Crowdmark approximately 7 days before the due dates. All assignments must be submitted via Crowdmark before the due date. Any MATLAB codes (.m files) should also be included in your Crowdmark submission (you can take picture of your code). </p><p>Most of the marks for the computational problems will be given for the description of the algorithm and the explanation of results and/or outputs. Submitting "raw code" will earn very few marks. Figures and graphs should be carefully created to present the data and conclusions in an effective and clear manner. Poor presentation of your work will result in an equivalently poor mark. In all cases, we expect you to explain your algorithm, and articulate your observations in detail. You are expected to submit your <strong>own </strong>code with documentation. MATLAB has good plotting features, make use of them. Create figures, when necessary, to include in your assignments.</p><p>Late submissions will be accepted up to 1 hour after the due date. There will be %100 lateness penalty for late submissions (more than 1 hour). If you submit an assignment late, e-mail the instructor so that you don't get an automatic zero.</p><p>The midterm is tentatively scheduled for Feb 13 6-8pm.</p><p>The final exam will be in the same format as the midterm exam. Time and date will be announced later.</p><p>All assessments are strictly individual work. Submitting anything that is not your own work will be processed according to the academic integrity rules (see below).</p><p>Requests related to the missed materials are handled by the instructor on a case-by-case basis, except when they fall under the Faculty of Mathematics guidelines (see https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations). Missing the final exam will require documentation and may result in an INC grade at the discretion of the instructor. To be considered for INC, you must have passed the midterm and the assignments. In addition, you must both contact the instructor and submit a VIF within 48 hours of the examination. Otherwise, a grade of DNW, with an associated mark of 32, will be assigned.</p><p>Student responsibilities are as follows:</p><ul><li>The student is expected to be familiar with the University policies, the course rules and any assessment specific guidelines. </li><li>If there are circumstances which may prevent successful completion of coursework, the student is expected to inform the instructor in a timely manner, which generally means ahead of time or during the assessment. In some cases, contacting the instructor a short time after the deadline is acceptable.</li></ul><p> </p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
