<p><strong>Assignments: </strong>There will be 5 assignments. Assignments are an important element of this course. They will help you to work through, practice, and apply the material discussed in the lectures. See schedule for assignment due dates. Assignments will be submitted and returned on Crowdmark. </p><p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> I encourage you to discuss the assignments with your classmates. However, since these are individually marked assessments, I expect you to write up your work independently. If you consult or use any references or resources other than the textbook and lecture notes, please cite them in your work. Keep in mind that <strong>the purpose of the assignments is to help you learn the course material and prepare for the midterm and final exam</strong>. You will not have access to your classmates or extra resources during the midterm and final exam. </p><p><strong>Policy on late assignments:</strong> Unless prior arrangements are made with the instructor, late assignments will receive a penalty of 1% per minute starting immediately after the deadline. Note about Crowdmark: although you can make as many submissions as you wish <i>before</i> the deadline, Crowdmark will only accept <i>one</i> submission after the deadline has passed (and this is only if you have not submitted anything at all before the deadline).  If you do have to submit an assignment late, you must make sure that your submission is complete: upload all of your files and <i>then</i> click the "submit" button. </p><p><strong>Policy on missed assignments and midterm:</strong> Missed assignments and tests will be given a mark of zero. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations">An accommodation may be given if there is a self-declared absence, VIF, or other extenuating circumstances.</a> For assignments, the accommodation may be an extension or re-weighting of the missed assignment to the other assignments. For midterm, the grades for the missed midterm will be shifted to the final exam. </p><p><strong>Midterm:  </strong>There will one 80-minute midterm to be held in the tutorial on Feb 25. Marked midterms will be returned on Crowdmark.</p><p><strong>Crowdmark tips: </strong>You will submit assignments using Crowdmark. Here are some general instructions for using Crowdmark:</p><ul><li>Answer each question on a separate page. Different parts of the same question (e.g. parts a, b, c) may be answered on the same page. It is OK if your answer to a question extends to more than one page.</li><li>If all your answers are in a single pdf file, you can submit the entire document for question 1 and then drag pages to the appropriate questions.</li><li>Assignments may be hand-written or typed. For hand-written assignments, scan your answers using a scanner or a smartphone scanning app.</li><li>A few days before the assignment due date, you will receive a Crowdmark link by email. Submit your work by following the instructions in the email. The email will be sent to your UWaterloo email address, so please remember to check it regularly. This is a personalized link, so do not share it with anyone else.</li><li>After submitting, close the Crowdmark browser window. Using a laptop or desktop (not a phone), click on the Crowdmark link again to view your submission. Be sure to confirm that your submission was successful, your pages are linked to the right questions and are in order, each page is oriented correctly, and your answers are legible.</li><li>If you notice any errors after submitting, you can submit again before the deadline. Resubmission will remove previous submissions.</li></ul><p> </p>

Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
