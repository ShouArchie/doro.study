<p>The goal of the course is to give an introduction to Einstein's theory of general relativity, starting form the symmetries of spacetime and culminating in a discussion of several simple predictions of the theory (Black holes, Comsology, etc). The differential geometry and tensor analysis that is needed to formulate the theory will be developed in the first part of the course. </p><p><strong>Note: </strong>There is a series of videos with the course content material, which can be found here:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeoh1MW56PeLn-tYxepNXBnfTMdbBemfJ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeoh1MW56PeLn-tYxepNXBnfTMdbBemfJ</a></p><p>and the course notes (which do not substitute the lectures) here</p><p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/emmfis/teaching/amath-475?authuser=0">https://sites.google.com/site/emmfis/teaching/amath-475?authuser=0</a></p><p>There is a Piazza forum created for this course.

Crowdmark will automatically apply a 2% deduction per hour (or part thereof) for assignments submitted after the deadline.</p><p>The video number refers to the video in the support Youtube Playlist with the online version of the course.</p><p><u>The </u><strong><u>Midterm</u></strong><u> date and location is</u></p><p>March 4th 6:00 PM - 8:20 PM  DC 1351</p><p>The final is not announced yet but will be updated here and learn when known.</p><p><strong><u>Self-Declared Absence and VIF policy</u></strong></p><p>The weight of any missed assignment deadline due to a justified cause (e.g., self-declared absence or Verified Illness Form [VIF]) will automatically be transferred to the next in-person assessment.

If the <strong>final exam</strong> is missed due to a justified cause, an <strong>INC (Incomplete)</strong> grade will be assigned.</p><p>Please be proactive in contacting the TAs if you find yourself in any of these situations so they can properly document your absence and ensure the weight adjustment is applied.</p><p><strong><u>Acknoledgements and collaboration policy</u></strong></p><p>For assignments, you are allowed to consult any materials and collaborate with others. However, you must be able to independently reproduce all the content of your submission without assistance and should be able to defend your solutions when requested by the instructor or the TAs. If you receive help in solving an assignment, you are required to include an <strong>Acknowledgements Section</strong>, detailing:</p><p>• Who assisted you and in what capacity.</p><p>• Any textbooks, sources, or materials you consulted, including links where applicable.</p><p>Failure to acknowledge the use of external materials, previous year solutions, or assistance from anyone currently enrolled in or who has previously taken the course will be flagged and reported for an <strong>academic integrity evaluation, </strong>in accordance with Policy 71.</p><p> </p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
