<p>Continuum mechanics is the study of motion and forces in solids and fluids. These materials are treated as continua and described in the language of vector calculus. We will derive the basic partial differential equations for solid and fluid mechanics and apply them to a variety of physical problems. This course provides a strong basis for further study in a number of different areas of application, including meteorology, oceanography, astrophysics, building ventilation, aerodynamics, seismology, structural engineering, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Lectures:</strong>  Lectures will be in person.  The lectures are a great learning opportunity and I encourage all of you to attend lectures and ask questions to allow you to learn the course material most easily.</p><p><strong>Discussions:</strong> Group discussions should be posted on piazza at this link <a href="https://piazza.com/class/lchybr98zwewt/">here</a>.  But you are also welcome to email the instructor for whatever question you might have about the course. [ <i>francis.poulin@uwaterloo.ca</i> ]</p><p><strong>Assignments: </strong>There will be 5 assignments (see schedule above) and the lowest mark will be dropped. Assignments are a crucial element of this course – they will help you to work through, practice, and apply the material discussed in the lectures. They are an essential part of learning the material and preparing for the tests and exam. Assignments are due on Thursdays on Crowdmark by 5:00 pm. You can submit assignments up to 72 hours late without penality.</p><p><strong>Collaboration: </strong>I encourage you to discuss the assignment problems with your classmates. However, since these are individually marked assignments, I expect you to write up your solutions independently. Please include an acknowledgements section in your assignment that lists the names of everyone you discussed the assignment with. If you consult any references other than the textbook and lecture notes, please cite them in your assignments. Copying solutions from any source, including your classmates, and/or presenting someone else’s work as your own is a serious academic offence and all suspected cases will be reported to the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies.</p><p><strong>Policy on late/missed assignments: </strong>You are expected to complete the assignments on time but if you need an extension please ask me and I will consider each situation on a case by case basis. </p><p><strong>Midterm test:</strong> There will be one hour midterm test to be held in class time on February 24th. </p><p><strong>Final examination:</strong> To be scheduled during the official exam period. Remember that travel plans are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time. Check the final exam schedule (usually available by mid-February) before making travel plans!</p><p><strong>Practice problems:</strong> There are lots of practice problems at the end of each chapter in the course notes. Some of these problems will be included in the assignments. You should attempt as many of the remaining problems as possible - they are an excellent way to learn and practice the course material.</p><p><strong>Pronouns: </strong>We will gladly refer to you by your chosen name and correct pronouns. Please consider indicating your pronouns in Quest and your chosen name in WatIAM.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
