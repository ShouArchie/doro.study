</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>MNS 431:</div>
<p>After a review of the essential concepts in nano-biomaterials, in-depth discussion includes two or three of the following topics: biomaterials on atomic and nanometre scales in which DNA, RNA, and/or polypeptides are incorporated as components; physical, chemical, and biological processes; nanoscale forces, adhesion, indentation; applications in nanomotors, nano-biomimetic materials, nanocomposite materials, and nano-biosensors.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>The focus of this course is on DNA-based biosensors and nanomaterials. General introduction to other soft materials including proteins, polymers and lipids may also be added if time allows. After going over the fundamentals about DNA chemistry, we will cover the design principle of various functional DNA-based biological sensors and materials. Topics for lectures are listed below. More detailed outlines will be provided on a lecture-by-lecture basis.</p><p><strong>Topic 1</strong>: DNA/RNA properties and chemical synthesis<br/><strong>Topic 2</strong>: Combinatorial selection of functional DNA<br/><strong>Topic 3</strong>: Examples of DNA-based biosensors<br/><strong>Topic 4</strong>: DNA-assembled nanomaterials<br/><strong>Topic 5</strong>: DNA-based materials<br/><strong>Topic 6</strong>: Immunoassays and lateral flow devices</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>The objective of the course is to provide students a broad view designing biosensors and biomaterials with biomacromolecules. DNA will be the central topic of the class, and other biopolymers and polymers will also be covered. Students are also required to perform literature search and study the current state-of-the-art sensor and biomaterials. Students will learn the basic nucleic acid chemistry and biotechnology. After successful completion of the course, students are expected to be able to read and understand related scientific papers and technical reports. Furthermore, students will be able to perform related engineering calculations to design practical sensors and materials. </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><u>Missed course elements</u>. We have already mentioned penalties for late submissions of homework assignments. For the two exams and presentations, you should make every effort to attend. If a student has to miss an exam with a valid reason, for example, by providing a Verification of Illness Forms (VIF), it might be possible to be accommodated. This will be handled on a case-by-case basis by the instructor. If the degree of incapacitation indicated on the note does not seem to be a valid reason for missing an exam or assignment, or there is something else about the documentation that does not warrant giving special consideration, a <strong>DNW</strong> (final examination not written) will be given for a missed final exam, or zero for an assignment. VIFs need to be specific and they will be handled to the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies. Students are encouraged to bring their VIFs to the Engineering Undergraduate Office for verification and filing. </p><p>If a student misses a homework assignment with a valid VIF, the portion of the grade will be added to his final exam. For example, instead of 30%, the final exam will be 35% of his final grade. If a final exam is missed with a valid VIF, the course assessment will be based on other elements such as homework, presentation, and final paper. </p><p>Students with disabilities<br/>“Note for students with disabilities: The Office for Persons with Disabilities (OPD), located in Needles Hall, Room 1132, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with the OPD at the beginning of each academic term.”</p><p><strong>Statement regarding travel and the final examination period</strong><i> </i><br/><i>“Student travel plans are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time.” </i>(see <a href="http://www.registrar.uwaterloo.ca/exams/finalexams.html">http://www.registrar.uwaterloo.ca/exams/finalexams.html</a> ). The mid-term exam date has already been set and the final exam schedule will be posted in about 6 weeks into the term. For Fall exams “please start checking toward the end of October”</p><p><strong>Unclaimed student submissions </strong></p><p>Unclaimed student submissions (e.g., assignments) will only be kept until the beginning of the next semester (May 2, 2014), and then they will be securely destroyed.  </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
