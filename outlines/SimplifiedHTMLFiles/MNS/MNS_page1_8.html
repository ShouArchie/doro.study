<p><strong>Lectures:</strong>  Your instructor will deliver lectures in-class, three times per week, with each lecture being a total length of 50 minutes. The lectures are recorded and will be posted online as MP4 videos on the MNS 221 - Winter 2025 UW LEARN site.  The lecture videos will be available to download and/or stream at your convenience.</p><p>    During lectures, your instructor will focus on selected topics, and he will assume that you will have prepared for each lecture by reading ahead in the course lecture notes.  He will not devote time to all topics discussed in the text and/or course lecture notes. You will have to learn some of the course material on your own.</p><p><strong>Online Assignments:</strong>  The online assignments provide you with an opportunity to apply the concepts introduced during lectures.  The assignments are provided online so that you can obtain frequent and immediate feedback on your understanding of the concepts.</p><p><strong>Textbook Problems: </strong> There are exercises and problems at the end of every chapter in the textbook.  If you choose to purchase the textbook, it is recommended that you try them for extra practice.  Textbook problems will not be graded.</p><p><strong>Instructor Contact:</strong>  Not all learning happens during the lecture.  You may find it necessary to contact your course instructor to get some extra help.  He will expect you to be prepared with a specific question or questions. (e.g., In reviewing my notes, I understand up to this point, but I get confused here.)  It is not a beneficial use of your time, or your instructor’s time, to state, “I just don’t get (insert general topic).” </p><p>    For questions involving calculations or significant detail, it is best to take a <i>clear</i> picture of your work using a smartphone and email it to your instructor.  Please take care to reduce the size (i.e., less than 1 MB) of the image file so that it can be emailed efficiently.  If email is not sufficient for answering questions, then in-person or online (e.g., <i>via </i>MS Teams) meetings can be arranged. </p>

<p><strong>Online Assignments (15%): </strong> The online assignments provide you with an opportunity to apply the concepts introduced during lectures.  The assignments are provided online so that you can obtain frequent and immediate feedback on your understanding of the concepts.  An assignment must be submitted for grading before the specified due date; otherwise, it will not be graded.</p><p><strong>Participation Activities (10%): </strong> There will be in-class participation activities involving the use of <a href="https://uwaterloo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ISTKB/pages/43612012797/iClicker+Cloud+Student+Accounts">iClicker Cloud</a> done throughout the term.  In-class participation is done via anonymous polling and not graded for correctness. Participation is <i>optional</i>; in other words, if you choose not to participate or if your Participation grade does not increase your final course grade, then the weight of your Participation grade will be transferred in the following manner: 2.5% to Term Test 1; 2.5% to Term Test 2; and 5% to the Final Exam. The participation grade will be determined as follows: 85% class participation = 100% class participation.</p><p><strong>Term Tests (2 × 15% = 30%):  </strong>There will be two term tests.  The tests will be composed of questions that are similar in style to the examples covered in class and questions from the online assignments. The tests are non-cumulative, and each test will cover specific sections and modules from the course lecture notes.  You will be provided with the <strong>MNS 221</strong> <strong>Data Sheets</strong> for the tests.  The tests will be held in class on <strong>Wednesday,</strong> <strong>February 12, 2025, and Wednesday,</strong> <strong>March 12, 2025</strong>.</p><p><strong>Final Exam (45%):  </strong>There will a final exam that covers all the course material; with a greater emphasis on content covered after the Term Tests.  The final exam will be composed of questions that are similar in style to the examples covered in class and questions from the online assignments. You will be provided with the <strong>MNS 221</strong> <strong>Data Sheets</strong> for the exam.  <strong>The final exam schedule will be released by the Registrar.</strong></p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Important Policies for MNS 221</strong></p><p><strong>Calculators: You can use any scientific calculator for the term tests and final exam in MNS 221.</strong></p><p><strong>Requests for Extra Credit or Grade Increases:</strong>  Please do not request extra marks from the course instructor. Arbitrarily increasing a final course grade is unethical and unfair to the rest of the class.  Such requests will not be responded to by the course instructor.</p><p><strong>Missing an online assignment:  </strong>Accommodations are not normally provided for missed assignments.  Assignments are available for an extended period, and you should be working on each assignment over an extended period.  Normally, a short illness (or other obligation) will not seriously impact a student’s ability to complete their assignments on time.  However, you should notify your instructor if you are ill for more than a week. Your instructor will consider your circumstances and notify you if any accommodations for missed assignments will be provided.</p><p><strong>Absence on the day of a term test or final exam:  </strong>If you do not write a term test, and have not planned with your instructor, you will receive a grade of zero on the test.  If you do not write the final exam, and have not made planned with your instructor, you will receive a final course grade of DNW (did not write), which is equivalent to a final course grade of 32%.</p><p>If you miss a term test or final exam because of illness or another valid, documentable reason, you can avoid a zero grade or DNW by completing the five-part process described below.</p><p><strong>Contact your instructor within 24 hours of a missed term test or exam.</strong> Emails can be received 24 hours per day. </p><ol><li><strong>Get documentation to explain your absence.</strong><ol><li>If you are ill, have yourself examined at University of Waterloo campus Health Services <i><strong>before or within 48 hours</strong> </i>of the missed term test or exam.  They will complete a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services"><strong>Verification of Illness Form (VIF)</strong></a> for you.  Assessment of illness must be based on an actual examination <i><strong>before or within 48 hours</strong> </i>of the term test or exam rather than an account of how you felt several days ago. <strong>VIFs issued by walk-in clinics will not be accepted</strong>, except when obtaining a VIF from Health Services is not possible. If you are ill on a weekend, during off-hours, while out-of-town or receiving ongoing care from a family physician or specialist, it is acceptable to provide documentation from other health service providers. Information should include date of physician assessment, dates of illness, level of incapacitation and whether the diagnosis was made by the physician or based on a description by the student.  If you do not have University of Waterloo's VIF with you at the time you are seen by the external health service provider, or the documentation provided does not include the required information, you will need to go back and have them complete and sign the VIF. This official verification is necessary before any action can be taken.</li><li>For other extenuating circumstances that are not illness related, for which the VIF is not appropriate, official documented proof that something has occurred will be required (consult with your instructor).  It is understood that sometimes events occur beyond your control so if in doubt, contact your instructor if you have a compelling reason.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Bring your documentation to the Science Undergraduate Office (STC 2031)</strong> <strong>once you are feeling better.</strong>  Your instructor will receive notification automatically by e-mail once you have done so.  Contact your instructor if you are unable to take your documentation to the Science Undergraduate Office within a week.</li><li><strong>Bring a copy of your documentation to your instructor.</strong>  The Science Undergraduate Office does not do this. You have two weeks from the date of the missed term test or exam to clear your zero/DNW grade.</li><li><strong>Wait for notification from your instructor.</strong> Your instructor will review the documentation, decide, and then notify you as to whether it will be accepted or if you will be assigned a grade of zero/DNW.  <i><strong>Note that filing documentation with the Science Office does NOT automatically excuse the missing of a term test or exam.</strong></i>  The information provided on the documentation will be evaluated when deciding whether a student should be excused.  Students should carefully consider the wisdom of missing a test or an exam.</li></ol><p><strong>Failure to carry out steps 1-5 above will result in a grade of zero on the term test or a DNW on the final exam. </strong>The following rules apply when the student’s documentation has been found acceptable.</p><ul><li><strong>Missing a term test:</strong> The weight of the term test will be transferred to the final exam. (<strong>There are no make-up term tests)</strong></li><li><strong>Missing the final exam:</strong>  A makeup exam will be arranged.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor to discuss the arrangements for writing a makeup exam.  The arrangements will be recorded on a form and sent to the Registrar’s office.  The student and instructor will receive a copy of the form by e-mail.</li></ul><p><strong>(See Faculty of Science Webpage for Up-to-Date Guidelines for </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances"><strong>Accommodations for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances</strong></a><strong>.)</strong></p><p><strong>Expectation of Academic Integrity</strong></p><p>The University of Waterloo subscribes to the strictest interpretation of academic integrity.  Faculty members and students bear joint responsibility ensuring that we maintain high standards of academic integrity. </p><p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: To maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility.
