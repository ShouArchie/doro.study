  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>GEOG 207:</div>
<p>Climate change is one of the most profound environmental and social issues affecting communities, nations and individuals. This course is an introduction to this global challenge, including its scientific underpinnings, history, potential impacts on natural systems and human societies around the world, and two societal responses: adaptation and greenhouse gas mitigation. Opportunities to develop sustainable resilient communities, as well as Canadian climate change policy responses, will be highlighted.</p>

<p>The goal of this course is to provide students of any discipline with the fundamentals of climate change: both biophysical and human dimensions.  This course will be delivered entirely online, and will provide students with an opportunity to hone science communication skills, explore sources of scientific uncertainty, political complexities, and equity implications of this global challenge.</p><p>Climate change is a pervasive and challenging phenomenon that can be viewed through a multitude of lenses. A scientific lens, for instance, reveals altered ecosystems and climatic tipping points while the lens of ethics raises the question of the right to develop and influence the well-being of others while doing so. By carefully laying the scientific foundations, we will explore creative, positive, nuanced visions of the future that are rooted in scientific understanding of earth systems but also capture (or at least begins a conversation about) core human values, such as equity, compassion, innovation, and connection.  A wider variety of actors are increasingly taking action on climate change, or bear some responsibility for doing so, giving us the opportunity to analyze coordinated, effective responses that go beyond international negotiations.</p><p>This course is intended for undergraduate students of all backgrounds (arts, social sciences, and sciences) who wish to explore the biophysical and human dimensions of climate change. The course will also help students to hone their abilities to communicate potential solutions to others.</p>

When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean.
