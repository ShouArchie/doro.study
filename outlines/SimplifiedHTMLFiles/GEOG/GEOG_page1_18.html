<div>
<div>
<div>GEOG 306:</div>
<p>This course will investigate the human dimensions of the global experience with natural hazards and associated disasters. The physical nature of a wide range of geophysical and biophysical hazards will be explored, paying particular attention to the ways in which hazards become dangerous to humans, and the pathways by which humans can either increase or decrease their vulnerability in the face of natural hazards.</p>

<p>Natural hazards and associated disasters are, in part, a product of inappropriate human modifications or management of the natural landscape. In a time where the human dimensions of natural hazards are becoming increasingly recognized, (e.g. Both the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake and Nepal’s 2015 earthquake saw heavy casualties due in large part to poor building standards, and damages from major hurricane and typhoon disasters such as 2013 Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines and 2022 Hurricane Ian in the United States have been linked to inadequate coastal zone planning), it is appropriate that this course focus on the ways in which humans increase or decrease the risks posed by natural hazards. </p><p>This course investigates the human dimensions of the global experience with natural hazards and associated disasters. A wide range of geophysical, meteorological and hydrological hazards are explored, paying particular attention to 1) the ways in which hazards become dangerous to humans, and 2) the pathways by which humans can either increase or decrease their vulnerability in the face of natural hazards. This is achieved by examining disaster risk reduction as it occurs throughout the disaster management cycle: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Throughout the course, case studies and examples drawn from countries and regions around the world will be used to clarify conceptual and methodological issues.</p>

<p><strong><u>In-Class Participation Activities</u> (10 x 1% = 10% of final grade)</strong></p><ol><li>Details about in-class ‘participation’ activities are provided exclusively during the class. These activities will vary in format and may include short online quizzes completed through LEARN, as well as brief written submissions completed at the end of the lecture. </li><li>Activities may be completed individually or as part of group work, depending on the instructions provided during class.</li><li>Responses should be submitted on LEARN or as a paper submission before leaving class.</li><li>A total of 12 in-class ‘participation’ activities are planned throughout the term. Completing all 12 (or at least 11) activities provides an opportunity to improve your grade, as LEARN will automatically select your top 10 scores when calculating your final grade. Each activity contributes 1% to your final course grade, emphasizing the importance of consistent participation.</li><li>Please note that these activities are designed to reinforce key concepts and promote collaboration. Active participation is strongly encouraged, as it will not only contribute to your grade but also enhance your learning experience.</li></ol><p><strong><u>Disaster Risk Analysis Report </u>(20% of final grade)</strong></p><ol><li>The detailed instructions for this assignment will be provided on LEARN.</li><li>Description: Analyze a chosen disaster to understand its causes, human vulnerability factors, and the role of disaster risk reduction.</li><li>Due: <u>February 1st at 11:59 PM</u></li></ol><p><strong><u>Vulnerability and Storytelling for Media </u>(20% of final grade)</strong></p><ol><li>The detailed instructions for this assignment will be provided on LEARN.</li><li>Description: Engage with the concept of vulnerability by crafting a compelling narrative that could be used in a media piece (e.g., news).</li><li>Due: <u>March 1st at 11:59 PM</u></li></ol><p><strong><u>Comparative Analysis of Responses to Specific Disasters </u>(20% of final grade)</strong></p><ol><li>The detailed instructions for this assignment will be provided on LEARN.</li><li>Select and compare two disaster response efforts for similar events across different regions.</li><li>Due:<u> March 22 at 11:59 PM.</u></li></ol><p><strong><u>Final Exam </u>(30% of final grade)</strong></p><ol><li>Final exam will be scheduled during the final exam period.</li><li>The exam will take the form of multiple choice and short/medium-length written answer questions.</li></ol><p><strong>Submitting Assignments:</strong></p><p>All assignments should be submitted via LEARN. Students should make arrangements for their assignments to be submitted to the appropriate dropbox on LEARN by the time and date indicated in the weekly schedule. Assignments should not be handed to the professor in class or emailed to the professor. LEARN provides a date and time stamp for all assignments submitted to the dropbox – this will be the date used to determine any late penalties that will be applied.</p><p><strong>Late Assignments:</strong></p><p>Assignments should be submitted by the due dates outlined in the course schedule (also see deadlines noted for each dropbox). However, a three-day grace period will be applied for the written assignments in the course (i.e., the grace period does not apply to in-class participation activities or the final exam). The grace period means that you can submit any assignment up to three days late without explanation or penalty. To encourage students to submit on time, a bonus mark will be applied based on the following submission dates: </p><ul><li>Submitted by the original due date at 11:59pm: 3% bonus added to assignment grade</li><li>Submitted within 24 hours of the original due date: 2% bonus added to assignment grade</li><li>Submitted within 48 hours of the original due date: 1% bonus added to assignment grade</li><li>Submitted within 72 hours of the original due date: no bonus and no late deduction</li></ul><p>Assignments submitted after the three-day grace has ended will have a late deduction applied at the rate of <strong>10% per day </strong>off the assignment grade. </p><p><i><strong>NOTE:</strong></i> There is no need to email the instructor or TA to have this grace period applied – you can simply submit your assignment at any point within the grace period without penalty. </p><p>Assignments will not be accepted for grading after the marking has been completed and feedback made available for students. </p><p>In some cases, concessions may be made for exceptional circumstances. </p><p><i><strong>NOTE:</strong></i> If you anticipate being unable to meet a deadline for any reason, please contact the instructor in advance to discuss potential alternative arrangements.</p><p><strong>Short-Term Absence Declarations</strong></p><p>Short-term absence declaration will be dealt with as follows: </p><ol><li><u>In-Class Participation Activities:</u> students can either a) count an activity as one of the already included dropped grades OR b) contact the professor to have a missed in-class participation activity re-weighted towards the final exam in the course.</li><li><u>Written Assignments:</u> short-term absence declarations only apply to the original due dates on assignments. The absence declaration will not impact the end date of the grace period; this means that if you use the three-day grace period, a short-term absence declaration on the final day of the grace period will not result in an additional two days to submit the assignment. This essentially removes the need for a short-term absence declaration, since a longer, three-day grace period has already been applied.</li><li><u>Final Exam:</u> short-term absence declarations cannot be used during the final exam period.</li></ol><p> </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
