<div>
<div>
<div>GEOG 209:</div>
<p>An introduction to the fundamental processes governing climate and hydrological systems and the links between them.  It starts with a discussion of basic atmospheric and hydrological processes and traces the flow of energy and water between the earth's surface and the atmosphere.  The water cycle is examined including evapotranspiration, precipitation, runoff and water storage in the natural reservoirs (including soil and groundwater, lakes and wetlands).</p>

<p>This course provides students with a thorough background of the fundamental processes governing the climate and hydrological systems, and the links between them. The course first reviews fundamental atmospheric and hydrologic processes, and traces the flow of energy and water between the Earth’s surface and the atmosphere. Then the physical processes controlling the water cycle are examined, including evapotranspiration, precipitation, runoff and water storage in the natural reservoirs (including soil and groundwater, lakes and wetlands). Finally, students will learn about the roles of water in climate in the Earth’s main biomes. </p><p> </p><p>Through the use of group activities students will be given the opportunity to gain experience manipulating real hydrological and meteorological data and instrumentation. This course will serve as an introduction to near-surface hydroclimatic processes, their feedbacks and climate change, forming essential background for upper level courses in climate change, hydroclimatology and environmental sciences and studies in general. The fundamental knowledge and skills developed in this course will provide students with the basis to appreciate and understand the natural hydrologic and climate systems. It also provides the required foundation for advanced courses in climatology and hydrology.  </p><p>The objective of this course is to provide students with the background to further their interests in weather and climate, and provide the theoretical foundations for upper level science and management courses.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
