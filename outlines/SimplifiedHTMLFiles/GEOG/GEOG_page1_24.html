  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>GEOG 314:</div>
<p>This course provides an overview of the key concepts related to climate services (i.e., useful, timely, and robust information about climatic trends that can support decision-making) and the development of the United Nations' Global Framework for Climate Services. The value of climate-informed decision-making across diverse sectors of the economy are examined, both for climate variability and extremes today and in an era of accelerating climate change. The scientific and practical challenges of utilizing climate information for decision-making in government policy, community planning, business operations, and international development, as well as the technical standards and professional ethics associated with providing climate services, are examined. Students gain practical experience in the development and application of climate services through climate data assembly and interpretation.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion posts</strong></p><p>Students will need to respond to and discussion <i><strong>5 posts</strong></i> through the term regarding the climate science and/or the sectors of climate services presented in class and via guest lectures. We will use <i>Perusal </i>to engage with discussion prompts and assess engagement with material. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Generative AI Assignment</strong></p><p>Students will be asked to used generative AI to explore how large language models are interpreting the varying opinions on climate change in the Canadian context and compare to the scientific evidence of climate change. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Midterm #1</strong></p><p>To demonstrate knowledge of the climate science and data, students will be required to work in teams of 3-5 to develop Instagram Reels/TikToks which depict the current knowledge of climate science, climate models, and climate change. This creative content should be directed toward the general public and/or peers to educate others on the current knowledge of this field. The content <i><strong>might</strong></i> be shared with the department and more broadly through the department's social media channels.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Midterm #2</strong></p><p>To demonstrate knowledge of the application of climate services, students will need to create an infographic which describes the importance of climate data in a sector &amp; region of the world. The infographic should be directed toward the general public/practitioners of the sector. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Final Project Paper</strong></p><p>Students will work in teams of 2-3 undergraduate students with one graduate student to explore the climate services used in a particular sector of the economy/society. The specific sector will need to be identified by the 4th week of the term. The paper will need to present a review of literature pointing to how climate data are currently used in the sector (or adjacent if the climate services in the sector are underdeveloped or nascent). 7-10 pages will be the expected length of the paper (excluding title page, tables/figures, and references). There will be three stages to the paper: outline, first draft, and final draft. The final draft will be due April 4.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Final Project Presentation</strong></p><p>To demonstrate clear scientific communications skills in a more academic and/or business style, each team of students will present their paper in an engaging 10-12 minute presentation with 3-5 minutes for questions. This will take place during the last week of class.</p>

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office</p><p><strong>Research Ethics:</strong> The University of Waterloo requires all research conducted by its students, staff, and faculty which involves humans as participants to undergo prior ethics review and clearance through the Director, Office of Human Research and Animal Care (Office). The ethics review and clearance processes are intended to ensure that projects comply with the Office’s Guidelines for Research with Human Participants (Guidelines) as well as those of provincial and federal agencies, and that the safety, rights and welfare of participants are adequately protected. The Guidelines inform researchers about ethical issues and procedures which are of concern when conducting research with humans (e.g. confidentiality, risks and benefits, informed consent process, etc.). If the development of your research proposal consists of research that involves humans as participants, the please contact the course instructor for guidance and see: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics</u></a></p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
