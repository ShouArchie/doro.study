  Course Description

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>GEOG 219:</div>
<p>Pandemics have decimated human populations, transformed societies and altered the course of human history. This interdisciplinary course examines these tumultuous events from antiquity to the 21st century to help us understand our lived experience of COVID-19, including its causes, differential geographic impacts, social inequities, and the process of building societal resilience.</p>

<p>In 2019 - 2021, the world experienced its second global pandemic in a century.  This has affected every aspect of every life in every country in the world.  This course will serve to unpack the pandemic, contextualize the pandemic, and encourage us to think critically about global experiences and responses.  Students will be exposed to a range of theoretical perspectives and debates and engage in a range of innovative assessment activities to illustrate their learnings.</p><p>The structure of the course is designed to enhance the student’s ability to: think critically, communicate well, and see themselves as a global citizen.</p><p>We will accomplish this by following a series of steps across 12 modules.  You will see these identified in each of the 12 learning modules; they are:</p><ul><li><strong>Read</strong> (before you start the module, read the assigned materials)</li><li><strong>Review</strong> (review the lecture burst – no more than 20 minutes of me talking to you, I promise!)</li><li><strong>Watch/Listen</strong> (there will typically be a video, or a film, or a podcast that will illustrate the concepts being discussed in the module)</li><li><strong>Do</strong> (there will typically be an exercise or a case study for you to engage in that allows you to see the application of the concepts being discussed in the module)</li><li><strong>Discuss</strong> (we will typically engage with each other through on-line discussion boards in order to facilitate peer learning; you should also discuss this material with others in your working and/or social worlds – what do <i><u>they</u></i> think about what you’re learning?)</li></ul><p>Finally, throughout the term there will be a number of Activities and Assignments that will allow you to display your learnings in a manner that allows me and the teaching assistants to evaluate them for grading purposes.</p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Course Policies</h3><p>If work is submitted late, it will be penalized by removing 5% each day after the due date (weekends included). The instructor recognizes that students periodically require relief from academic work for medical or other personal situations. This policy aims to manage these requests by taking into account the needs and obligations of students. For medical or personal situations resulting in missed academic work, a note from a doctor or counselling services should be provided. The late policy will not be applied if a doctor’s or counsellor’s note is not provided. Missed work without an explanatory note signed by a third party will be given a mark of zero.</p><p>Please ensure you save an electronic copy of all of your work. Following submission of assignments, please allow approximately 1 to 2 weeks for marks to be returned. The instructor and university reserve the right to modify elements of the course during the term. The university may change the dates and deadlines for any or all courses in extreme circumstances. If either type of modification becomes necessary, reasonable notice and communication with the students will be given with explanation and the opportunity to comment on changes. It is the responsibility of students to check their email and course websites frequently during the term to note any changes.</p><h4>Student Conduct</h4><p>Behaviour in all aspects of this course should meet the standards expected at the University of Waterloo. Inappropriate behaviour directed against colleagues, or the instructor will not be tolerated. Inappropriate behaviour in aspects of this course outside of the classroom (e.g., Learn Discussion Board) will not be tolerated.</p><h4>Mark Appeals</h4><p>You have one week from the date that an assignment is returned to appeal your mark. If you wish to appeal a grade, you must submit a written note justifying why you wish to have the assignment remarked, with the assignment attached. If the written justification is insufficient (e.g., simply wanting a higher grade is insufficient), the assignment will not be re-graded. If the justification is sufficient, the entire assignment will be re-graded. Your mark can therefore increase or decrease.</p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h3>Department Policies</h3><p> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
