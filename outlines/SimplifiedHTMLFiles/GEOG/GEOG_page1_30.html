<p>This course is designed to provide students with an introduction to issues of health and health care as seen through a geographical lens. Our health is shaped by our 'geographies' - the places and environments in which we live, work and play. Where we live shapes our health outcomes and access to services we have as well as the broad range of determinants of health. Places shape both physical and mental health; they may or may not help people age well; they may or may not be therapeutic or healthy. The characteristics of places may serve to aid the spread of infections, whether in the global north or the global south. And inequalities in this essential resource - health - abound. </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p><strong>Course Format &amp; Evaluation: </strong>We will do everything we can to endeavor to create an active learning environment in this course. At times, this may be restricted by class size, but that will always be the goal! So, we will request and expect student engagement during lessons and we suggest that students attend the lectures having read the pre-assigned chapter of the textbook. We will have several guest speakers in attendance throughout the term. These people are experts in their field and are outstanding contributors to the science around the geographies of health and health care. It is important to note that all material covered in the course (current events, lectures, readings, guest speakers, films) is eligible for testing on exams.</p><p><strong>Course structure: </strong>This class will meet for 3 hours every week. The first <strong>20 minutes </strong>will be spent discussing current events that reflect how geography shapes our health. Students will be strongly encouraged to contribute – indeed LEAD – this discussion (after the first week, of course!). While no FORMAL grade will be assigned to this section of the grading scheme, a <strong>bonus </strong>of 1.5 marks will be given to any student who chooses to lead<strong> </strong>the introductory section of the class. Students may lead a maximum of twice during the term. PURPOSE: identify your current event; how does it relate to health geography; prompt discussion by asking 1 or 2 thought provoking questions.</p><p>The next <strong>60-75 minutes </strong>will be spent in lecture format. Following the lecture, there will be a break of approximately <strong>15 minutes</strong>. Following the break, we will engage in an active learning activity that could take one of many forms; this will be addressed on a weekly basis. But to give you an idea it might involve breaking into groups for discussion, a debate, engaging a guest speaker in discussion, having a tutorial on some additional reading assigned for the week via LEARN, or watching a film followed by discussion.</p><p>In undertaking the various elements of this course, the intent is to explore geographies of health from the global to the local.</p><p><strong>Course Schedule:</strong></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Week</strong></td><td><strong>Date</strong></td><td><strong>Topic</strong></td><td><strong>Reading</strong></td><td><strong>Instructor</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>January 9</td><td>Introduction</td><td> </td><td>R.

<p>Written assignments must be <strong>submitted into the dropbox on LEARN. </strong>Please include a title page with your name and student number, title, and date.</p><p><strong>Position paper: </strong>Students will write a two (2) page position paper that completes the following sentence: <i><strong>The greatest health problem today is.... </strong></i>Use at least 3 <i><strong>peer reviewed sources </strong></i>to support your argument. You may use additional sources (e.g., government documents posted on the web) but these must be over and above your 3 peer reviewed references. Your paper must not be longer than 2 pages in length (exclusive of references or tables/figures), double spaced, no smaller than 12 point font, and one inch margins.<br/><br/>The primary purpose of this assignment is to: 1) take a position; 2) build an argument; 3) defend your position. Thus, you will be evaluated on your capacity to do these three things, well, and do so in a clearly articulated and well referenced manner.</p><p><strong>Reflection Assignments</strong>: As defined, ‘reflection’ means to give something serious thought or consideration. You will be asked to write a <strong>one-page </strong>reflection on 3 of the 4 weekly modules. That is, there will be FOUR (4) opportunities provided but you will only have to provide THREE (3). This is simply to recognize that you are busy people with busy lives and other courses and sometimes you just have to set priorities! No references, just your (critical) reflections. Your paper should be double-spaced, no smaller than 12 point font, and one inch margins. <i><strong>These deadlines vary, so stay tuned!</strong></i></p><p><i>Follow this outline, think critically, write with clarity: </i>3 sections of a (critical) reflection: </p><ul><li><strong>The what:</strong><br/>A description of the experience with just enough detail to support doing your ‘so what’ section. For example, a description of: who, what, when, where and why</li><li><strong>So what?</strong><br/>This is the sense-making section that asks you to bring to the surface the general meaning, significance, your position/view point; actions; emotions...</li><li><strong>Now what? </strong>This section makes connections from the experience/incident to further actions. For example, how did the guest speaker change your thinking about things going forward? What were the key points/lessons learned to share with your colleagues, friends, etc?</li></ul><p><strong>Debate: </strong>Students will be organized into teams for an in-class debate (pro and con) about a current public health issue. More details will be provided in class. There will be time set aside in class to prepare for the debate with your groups.</p><p><strong>Late policy:</strong> There will be a grace period of two days following each deadline where assignments will be accepted for marking without penalty. Past the two-day grace period, late work will incur a penalty of -5% per day late. Late work will not be accepted more than 14 days past due.</p>
