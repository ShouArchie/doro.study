  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>GEOG 471:</div>
<p>Digital image analysis for resource mapping and evaluation using remote sensing data. Topics range from initial data selection to final map production and assessment. Using commercial image analysis software, students will analyse data for a selected area and produce a portfolio of results. In addition, they will undertake a literature review on a selected topic and present highlights of the review at an end-of-term mini-conference.</p>

<div>
<p>This course has a strong application focus in the form of <i><strong>remote sensing observations for climate and land cover change studies</strong></i>. The aim of this course is to develop students’ theoretical and practical understanding of remote sensing through project-based work using a variety of image analysis software to address a substantive aspect of climate change. It builds on courses GEOG271, GEOG371 and GEOG293/294. Working in a group and individually, students identify and develop a research study that uses remote sensing data sets to address a substantive issue related to environmental change. </p>

<p>The LEARN course environment is central for course material dissemination and information exchange. It will be used to manage course materials (multi-media files, podcasts links etc.), interact with their students (drop boxes for student submissions, on-line quizzes, discussion boards, course e-mail etc.), and provide feedback (grades, assignment comments etc.). Please note that announcements regarding LEARN (service outages etc.) are posted; please check these regularly. In addition, a LEARN student guide can be found at http://uwaterloo.ca/learn-help. </p><p><i>Students are responsible for maintaining their own backups of their work</i>. There are a number of options available for backing up your work, including Office 365 OneDrive cloud storage. It is suggested that you keep two copies of your work in separate locations. Remember that you are only as far ahead as your latest backup! However, do not attempt to access data from (e.g.) Geomatica (Catalyst) directly from the OneDrive as it is slow and not always robust - copy the data to a local drive to work on it and then copy it back to the OneDrive.</p><p>Students are expected to get into the habit of using the on-line files as the first source of help. I will be available in my office for consultation during regular office hours or by appointment. I will also check UW-LEARN course-related e-mail and discussion groups on a daily basis. Additional help is available from the ETIS help desk and the TA. Mike Lackner will also be available to answer questions related to lab assignments in this course. </p><p>GEOG 471 is a double weighted course. This means that there is significantly more expectation on students than on a single weighted course. It is in your interests, therefore, to attend seminars/lectures and lab tutorials with your group and contribute strongly to the group project. In the past, students who have not been engaged in the group, have missed meetings and have not contributed strongly have lost marks in this course. </p><p>Seminars are there for your benefit. Please come prepared to engage in the material and be ready to ask questions. Open laptops will not be allowed during lectures unless expressly requested for note taking. </p><p>Lab tutorials are mandatory and are there for you to engage with group members and to ask for advice and assistance from TA, the instructor and Mike Lackner. Lab time is an essential core time to enable groups to work together on individual or common issues. 6% of the overall course grade comes from the six lab tasks.</p><p>Students will choose their own groups. If you are unable to find a group, please let the instructor know so steps can be taken to find a home for you.</p><p> </p>

<p>It is in your interest to keep to the deadlines for assignment submission. Late work will be sanctioned with 20% deducted from the assignment for each week or part thereof for which the work is late. Sanctioned work will receive no feedback. See the section <i><strong>Illness and other absences requiring academic considerations</strong></i> below for details. Requests to the instructor must follow these procedures to obtain a valid extension.</p>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  University Policy

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
