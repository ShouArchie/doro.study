  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>GEOG 416:</div>
<p>An exploration of how sustainability is sought within the international aviation industry. The course takes a cross-sectional approach to aviation, exploring sustainability within the various sectors that make up the air transport system (e.g., air law, aircraft, operations, navigation, airports, and safety). Both the positive and negative impacts of aviation upon the sustainable development goals will be analyzed through reviewing case studies and industry practices. This course includes significant student project teamwork.</p>

<p>This course provides an in-depth exploration of sustainable practices and principles within the aviation industry. Through an analysis of key concepts, stakeholders, and technologies, students will gain a thorough understanding of how aviation can move towards a more sustainable future. The course integrates interdisciplinary perspectives to examine the three pillars of sustainability and their application in the different components of the aviation industry (airports, airlines, air traffic system, manufacturing). Students will also have the opportunity to explore the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their alignment with the aviation industry.</p>

<p><strong><u>Personal Profile:</u></strong> You are expected to upload your bio, domain of expertise, and skills. This document should describe your research interests, specific skill sets, and relevant work experience.</p><p><strong><u>Participation: </u></strong>Refers to the active involvement and engagement of students during classroom activities, discussions, and exercises. It encompasses actively participating in class by asking questions, answering questions, sharing opinions, offering insights, and contributing to class discussions and activities. Additionally, there will be in-class submissions related to other assignments (SDG and Research Project), which will also contribute to participation marks.</p><p><strong><u>Reflection:</u></strong> This is a 'no-wrong-answer' exercise. It will be a spontaneous response -- reflecting your ideas -- related to sustainability and aviation.</p><p><strong><u>SDG Assignment:</u></strong> This is a group* assignment to address a Sustainability Development Goal (SDG) in relation to the aviation industry. Choose an SDG and prepare a presentation that discusses this SDG in the aviation context. Your presentation is expected to be 15 minutes in duration. You are expected to introduce the SDG you chose first and clearly explain how it relates to the aviation industry. Examples from real life are most welcomed. You are required to submit a 1000-1500 words written report of your analysis. Submissions made after the deadline will not be considered for evaluation.</p><p><strong><u>Research Project:</u></strong> This is a group* assignment. You are expected to identify a research question in the context of aviation sustainability. You are expected to submit the research question a mid-report and a final report. Feedback will be given for the research question and mid-report. A mid-semester in-class presentation will allow student groups the opportunity to present preliminary ideas regarding the research project for feedback. The final research presentations will take place during the last two weeks of the semester. Deliverables and their value for this assignment are as below: </p><p><strong>Deliverables (Total 60%) </strong></p><ol><li>15%     Deliverable 1: Proposal <br/>               - Research Question <br/>               - Literature Review <br/>               - Timeline of project milestones <br/>               - Team member accountability <br/>               - Other proposal aspects</li><li>5%     Deliverable 2: Proposal Presentation</li><li>10%    Deliverable 3: Paper Presentation</li><li>25%   Deliverable 4: Paper Submission <br/>               - Introduction<br/>               - Methods<br/>               - Analysis<br/>               - Results<br/>               - Discussion<br/>               - Conclusion</li><li>5%     Deliverable 5: Peer evaluations</li></ol><p>*Notes on Group Assignments: You may choose your group as you wish. However, students who have not chosen a group by the deadline will be randomly assigned to a group by the instructor. All members of your group must make substantial contributions to the assignment. It is required to use slides in the presentation; however, this should not be interpreted as a session of reading the slides. You are expected to speak about your ideas.</p><p><strong>Late submissions will not be accepted and will receive a mark of zero. Exceptions may be made for extreme documented medical reasons and verified hardware failure. </strong>Requests for compassionate consideration are to be discussed with the professor in advance or as soon as possible.</p><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office</p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Generative AI</strong><br/>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions.</p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p>
