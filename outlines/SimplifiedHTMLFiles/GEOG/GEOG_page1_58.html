<p>This course is designed as a projects course, with an emphasis on independent and team learning through applied problem solving in research projects. Selected research problems will be provided by client organizations (academic, government, business or civil society) for teams to consider. Each team will also have the option to identify their own project topic with a client organization (e.g., previous employers or academic supervisors) or independently (e.g., a start up business concept). Project concepts identified by student team will be discussed with the instructor to assess its feasibility and suitability for the course. </p><p>The primary outcome of the course is a final team project presented in both oral and written format at the end of term to the other class teams and clients where applicable and feasible. Other components in the course are structured to support the development of the team project, including a project proposal and scheduled project update meetings (see course schedule below). Progress meetings provide an opportunity to discuss challenges teams may be facing and to obtain feedback/guidance from the instructor and other teams. Students are expected to actively participate in the progress meetings throughout the term and contribute equally to the group project. The instructor will be available every week for consultation as required, even when no formal class is scheduled.  The audience for the final presentations may include people from outside the course (i.e., a professional panel), to provide additional feedback on presentation quality and project outcomes. Final reports will be submitted after the final presentations to allow for an opportunity to incorporate feedback and comments. </p><p>Course participants will enhance problem solving, critical thinking, and analytical skills and gain experience with the full range of activities associated with professional practice, including: evaluating requests for proposals, formulating research objectives and proposal development, team-based research, project management, presentations, report writing, teamwork and leadership, as well as professional and research ethics. A key component of all professional practice and complex projects is teamwork, and this course will include the challenge of interpersonal dynamics and utilizing individual skill sets. </p>

<p>All assignments will be submitted to the specified LEARN Dropbox.</p><p>As this course involves project-based group work at its core, students will be required to submit a signed <i>University of Waterloo Group Assignment Disclosure Form. </i></p><p>Each student’s final mark will be determined on the basis of both the team project and their individual contributions to the team and in-class discussions. Each team will sign a team agreement to commence their project. At the end of term, the contribution of each team member to the team project will be evaluated by all other team members and grades adjusted accordingly: <i>Individual project grade = (team grade from parts 2,3,4) * (peer adjustment factor).</i></p><p><i>Late Penalties</i>:<strong> </strong>A penalty of 10% per day will be assessed for late assignments without a valid academic reason. **Note that in professional practice, late submission of a proposal would result in disqualification from competition and late submission of deliverables can result in forfeit of final payment.</p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><p><strong>Research Ethics:</strong> The University of Waterloo requires all research conducted by its students, staff, and faculty which involves humans as participants to undergo prior ethics review and clearance through the Director, Office of Human Research and Animal Care (Office). The ethics review and clearance processes are intended to ensure that projects comply with the Office’s Guidelines for Research with Human Participants (Guidelines) as well as those of provincial and federal agencies, and that the safety, rights and welfare of participants are adequately protected. The Guidelines inform researchers about ethical issues and procedures which are of concern when conducting research with humans (e.g. confidentiality, risks and benefits, informed consent process, etc.). If the development of your research proposal consists of research that involves humans as participants, the please contact the course instructor for guidance and see: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics</u></a></p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p>
