<h2>Course Structure</h2><p>The course consists of a three hour seminar (lecture/discussion) session each week.  Introductory lectures will provide an overview of key theory for digital mapping and spatial analysis using GIS.  Students are expected to learn any concepts and functions for GIS analysis required for lab assignments or term projects independently or with supplemental readings recommended by the instructor. </p><p>Since this course is seminar-based, no lab component is formally scheduled.  However, significant additional time outside of class will be required to complete the term assignment and to prepare for presentations and discussions.  Students are welcome to use the GIS computing labs in EV1, which are managed by Environment Technology &amp; Instructional Support (ETIS).</p><h4>Class Meetings</h4><p>Class meetings and lectures are held at the following location and time:</p><p>Location:          Environment 1 (EV1), Room 350</p><p>Time:                Thursday, 11:30 a.m.-2:20 p.m.</p><p>Lecture slides are provided as PDF files on the LEARN website due to copyright restrictions.  Lectures cover important theoretical concepts and supplement hands-on lab assignments.</p><p>If a shift to remote learning is necessary, lectures will be delivered in asynchronous format and as video files on the LEARN website.</p><h4>Lab Assignments</h4><p>Students will be required to complete four lab assignments that utilize ArcGIS Pro, which is the most popular GIS software and an industry standard in many fields.  Practical hands-on lab assignments provide an opportunity for students to learn how to use the software and to gain hands-on experience with applying concepts from lectures in the software environment.  The assignments are designed to help students make connections between the concepts discussed in the lectures and how they can be applied in the software. Practical lab assignments expose students to fundamental techniques for map design and data input, management, and analysis. </p><p>Since no lab sections are formally scheduled, students are expected to devote significant independent time to learn software skills and to work on lab assignments.  The time required to complete lab assignments differs from person to person.  Students are expected to commit a substantial amount of time to working on software, mapping, and problem solving.  The ability to work independently is a valuable skill for all GIS users and students are encouraged to take advantage of all available resources and relevant ArcGIS Help sections.  Resources of help will be made available and students may post questions on the course discussion board or visit office hours or help sessions as posted on LEARN.</p><p>All work for lab assignments should be submitted according to the instructions provided in the exercises. All submissions will be digital, and must be submitted according to the instructions by the due date for grading.  Assignments should be properly formatted, clearly presented, and easy to read/follow. Indicated time estimates for completing lab exercises are estimates only and do not account for technical troubleshooting.  Students are advised to leave ample time to complete assignments.  Make sure to read and to follow lab assignment instructions carefully.</p><h4>GIS Applications Term Project</h4><p>Students will be required to complete a term project using GIS.  Evaluation of the term project will be based on, (a) the project’s methodological and organizational design, (b) application of appropriate GIS techniques, and (c) presentation of the final results in both oral and written form. The final deliverables of the term assignment include submitting a brief written summary of the proposed project topic. During the last weeks of term, final reports will be submitted and final presentations made.  <i>At least one progress meeting should be scheduled with the instructor outside of class for project consultation, which will contribute to the student’s class participation mark.</i></p><h4>Class Participation/Engagement/Progress &amp; Attendance</h4><p>Class participation/discussion will be monitored throughout the term and account for 5% of the total course grade.  This grade will be assigned at the instructor’s discretion and evaluated holistically, based on participation and engagement in class discussions and activities, project consultation meetings, and completion of assignments.  Note that passive attendance is not the same as active class participation (i.e., engagement), which is evaluated at the instructor’s discretion and judgment.</p><p>Students should be proactive/organized and schedule at least one progress meeting with the instructor outside of class for project consultation, advice, or update during the term, which will contribute to the class participation/progress grade.  No project consultation/update will result in at least 2% deduction.  Consideration will also be given to students who demonstrate effective time management in the course by submitting all assessments (lab assignments, term assignments, etc.) on time before stated deadlines.</p><p>Class attendance will be monitored throughout the term and account for 4% of the total course grade.  1% of the total grade will be deducted for a recorded absence up to a maximum of four.  The instructor has the discretion to evaluate the attendance grade and to deduct marks for excessive tardiness, leaving class excessively early, etc.</p><h4>LEARN Course Environment</h4><p>LEARN is a web-based course management system that enables instructors to manage course materials (posting of lecture notes, etc.), interact with their students (drop boxes for assignment submissions, discussion boards, course e-mail, etc.), and to provide feedback (grades, assignment comments, etc.).  Data files for all course modules will be found on LEARN.  Log onto LEARN using your Quest/UW userid and password here:  <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca">https://learn.uwaterloo.ca</a></p><h4>Resources</h4><p>ArcGIS Pro software is used for all lab work in this course.  Manuals are available as on-line help files. Students are expected to use the on-line help to obtain information on operations that are not fully detailed in the assignment.  Other resources will also be posted on the LEARN webpage.</p><h4>Required Course Supplies</h4><ul><li>A portable hard drive, USB thumb drive, or cloud storage for backing up work is required.</li><li>Students will normally access ArcGIS Pro software using computers in the MAD General Use Lab.  In case pivoting to a remote teaching environment is required (short-term or longer-term), access to a computer that is able to run ArcGIS Pro software either locally installed on a Windows operating system or via remote access using a stable internet connection.</li></ul><h4>Submitting Course Deliverables &amp; Assignments</h4><p><strong>Unless otherwise stated, all assignments are due at the beginning of class (e.g., 11:30 a.m.) on the date indicated in the course schedule.</strong>  If an assignment is due outside of regular class time, it is your responsibility to submit your assignment and ensure that it is properly received by the instructor.  No late assignments are accepted in this graduate level course, unless with permission granted by the instructor.  Late assignments will result in a zero grade.  If for some reason you are unable to submit your lab assignment by the due date, contact the instructor as soon as possible.</p><p>Oral presentations in this course will be delivered on specified dates during class.  Students are expected to use the digital projector available in conjunction with Powerpoint or appropriate presentation software or visuals.  The audience for the final presentations of individual assignments may include people from outside the course.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Alternate Arrangements for Cancelled In-Person Classes: </strong>Lectures/class meetings may be cancelled (as indicated in the course schedule or as announced in class) and a make-up class may be rescheduled, if required. If a make-up class is rescheduled, a date/time will be selected based on a class poll of availability and with majority agreement.  Maximum effort will be made to select a schedule conflict-free time. </p><p>If a make-up class is not rescheduled or if there is a need to pivot to a remote teaching environment during the term (for a short-term or longer-term duration), classes will move to a synchronous format with relevant links and details/instructions posted on LEARN or else a project work period will be assigned.  Any synchronous sessions may be recorded and oral presentations will be submitted in digital format with instructions provided on LEARN.</p><p>Should there be a need to pivot to a remote teaching environment during the term (for a short-term or longer-term duration), instructions for ArcGIS Pro software access will also be provided on LEARN with two options for, (a) installing the software onto your own Windows computer, or (b) via remote lab access, which requires a stable internet connection.</p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>.<br/><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
