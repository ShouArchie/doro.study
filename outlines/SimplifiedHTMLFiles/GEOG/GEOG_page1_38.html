<p>Remote sensing is an important scientific technique for environmental monitoring and management. It is used for global environmental change studies and for more local scale applications such as urban landscape mapping, precision farming and hazard mapping. This course introduces and develops student understanding and skill at using remote sensing information extraction techniques to provide information about human and physical environments. Remote sensing products are increasingly used by municipalities, environmental consultancies, federal agencies and industry that seek to use actionable information about human and physical environments. The course builds on the fundamentals of remote sensing science and Earth observation systems (e.g. visible-infrared and microwave satellite and airborne observing systems) introduced in GEOG271. It focuses on current information extraction approaches, such as image enhancement and transformations, classification / pattern recognition techniques (including machine learning), and geospatial statistics models, along with accuracy assessment to evaluate retrieved information quality. The methods are presented and explored using active and passive remote sensing systems. </p><p>This course focuses on the use of remote sensing to map key environmental states. Emphasis is placed on the application of remote sensing methods and data processing for analysis of physical and human environments. The course presents advanced techniques for further remote sensing and Earth observation work and gives the student a strong basis from which to develop their analytical skills. </p>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<p><strong>Course Delivery I: Information Content </strong><br/>The course continues from where GEOG 271 left off by focusing on how remote sensing can be used to provide quantitative information about Earth surface environments. Each week, a lecture topic will be delivered in person that presents new material to students. These are 2 hour lectures followed later in the week by a two hour lab. Recent research indicates that students retain knowledge better if they make their own notes with pen and paper rather than note taking on a computer (<i>Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard: Advantages of Longhand Over Laptop Note Taking, Psychological Science, </i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0956797614524581"><i><u>https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0956797614524581</u></i></a>.)</p><p><i><strong>Contingency</strong></i> If you are unable to make the lecture, the Powerpoint slides will be available. In addition, you will be directed to core readings so you can keep up with the lecture content. </p><p><strong>Course Delivery II: Weekly Labs</strong><br/>In addition to the lectures, students are expected to attend practical lab exercises that make up applied assignments and short practicals. All labs will be attended by TA(s) who will provide introductory remarks and practical assistance. We will be using a combination of PCI Geomatica (Catalyst), LAStools, Google Earth Engine and ArcGIS. Other open source software may also be used. The lab machines have all of these packages available. <br/><i><strong>Contingency</strong></i> From time to time, it is understood that students may be unable to attend a lab through illness. In such cases students will be able to access the lab software through the Azure Virtual Desktop system. Full access instructions will be provided on Learn. </p><p><strong>Course Delivery III: Office Hours</strong><br/>You are strongly encouraged to use office hours that are available from the TA and the instructor. Evidence shows that full engagement with the course instructor and TA increases the likely grade outcome for students. For technical issues related to the lab software, Mike Lackner can be available by appointment.</p><p><i>Students are responsible for maintaining their own backups of their work. </i>There are a number of options available for backing up your work, including Office 365 OneDrive cloud storage. It is suggested that you keep two copies of your work in separate locations. Remember that you are only as far ahead as your latest backup! However, do not attempt to access data from (e.g.) Geomatica(Catalyst) directly from the OneDrive as it is slow and not robust. ALWAYS COPY THE DATA TO A LOCAL DRIVE.</p><p><strong>Assignments and Practicals late sanctions</strong>. It is in your interest to keep to the deadlines for assignment submission. Late work will be sanctioned with 20% deducted from the assignment for each week or part thereof for which the work is late. Sanctioned work will receive no feedback. See the section <strong>Illness and other absences requiring academic considerations </strong>below for details. Requests to the instructor must follow these procedures to obtain a valid extension.</p><p>Students are <strong><u>required</u></strong> to attend a five-minute meeting with the instructor in the third and fourth weeks of the course to discuss progress and any issues that might have arisen. Office hours will be used for this purpose. Any more in-depth issues may be dealt with through an appointment with the TAs or the instructor.</p><p><strong>Generative AI</strong><br/>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions.</p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
