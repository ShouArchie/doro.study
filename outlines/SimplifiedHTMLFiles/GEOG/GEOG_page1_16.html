<h2>Modules</h2><p>The course is structured around 10 modules, which are designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of GIS.</p><ul><li><strong>Module 1:       What is GIS?</strong></li><li><strong>Module 2:       Spatial Data Models</strong></li><li><strong>Module 3:       Georeferencing I – Map Design and Datums</strong></li><li><strong>Module 4:       Georeferencing II – Map Projections         </strong></li><li><strong>Module 5:       Vector GIS Fundamentals</strong></li><li><strong>Module 6:       Vector GIS Analysis</strong></li><li><strong>Module 7:       Raster GIS Fundamentals</strong></li><li><strong>Module 8:       Raster GIS Analysis</strong></li><li><strong>Module 9:       Data Acquisition and Data Quality</strong></li><li><strong>Module 10:     Spatial Data Analysis and Modelling</strong></li></ul><p>The module-based course structure enables GIS concepts to be broken down into smaller groupings or “chunks”, so students will be able to easily track their progress and completed milestones in the course.  The modules will be given recommended timeframes for completion (approximately one week per module) with assignment deadlines as indicated. Each module will have learning outcomes and comprise of two components, (a) lectures and (b) lab.  Support discussion forums are available.  Forms of assessment will be incorporated into each module.</p><h4>Lectures</h4><p>Lectures are held at the following location and time:</p><p>Location:          Arts Lecture (AL) Hall, Room 116</p><p>Time:                Monday, 10:30 a.m.-12:20 p.m.</p><p>Lecture slides are provided as PDF files on the LEARN website due to copyright restrictions.  Lectures cover important theoretical concepts, supplement hands-on lab assignments, and are the basis of Midterm and Final Exam assessments.</p><p>If a shift to remote learning is necessary, lectures will be delivered in asynchronous format and as video files on the LEARN website.  Each module will have multiple lecture files (each usually less than 15 minutes in length).</p><h4>Labs</h4><p>Labs will be held in-person in the Galileo GIS Lab (EV1, Room 240). Assignments are completed individually using ArcGIS Pro software.  Students are registered in a lab section with a designated Teaching Assistant (TA).  Labs are held every week and the lab schedule is listed below [lab section number in brackets]:</p><p>Monday:           4:30 p.m.-6:20 p.m.      [101]                </p><p>Tuesday:           6:30 p.m.-8:20 p.m.      [102]</p><p>Wednesday:           8:30 a.m.-10:20 a.m.      [103]</p><p>Wednesday:           4:30 p.m.-6:20 p.m.      [104]</p><p>Wednesday:           6:30 p.m.-8:20 p.m.      [105]</p><p>Thursday:           8:30 a.m.-10:20 a.m.    [106]</p><p>Thursday:           4:30 p.m.-6:20 p.m.    [107]</p><p>Thursday:           6:30 p.m.-8:20 p.m.    [108]</p><p>Friday:           10:30 a.m.-12:20 p.m.    [109]</p><p>Friday:           2:30 p.m.-4:20 p.m.    [110]</p><p>When labs are held in-person, only attend the lab session you are assigned to, otherwise assignments submitted to different lab sections may not be marked.  Designated lab sections are to accommodate room capacity and social distancing requirements.  Attendance will be monitored and no switching between lab sections is permitted.</p><p><strong>Online Accommodations (only if necessary):  </strong>In the scenario when it is necessary for classes to be held remotely (e.g., due to a pandemic), labs will be completed individually using ArcGIS Pro, which can be accessed either by, (a) installing the software on your own Windows computer, or (b) via remote access, which requires a stable internet connection.  You must have access to a computer that is able to run ArcGIS Pro software either installed locally or via remote access, since this is required for completing all lab assignments (see the “Resources” section).  In this scenario, lab sessions will be migrated to a virtual environment and used as a drop-in session for students to ask their TA questions about lab assignments.  WebEx links and TA assignments will be provided on LEARN, only if such a need arises.</p><p><strong>Assistance:  </strong>Please contact your TA first for lab-related questions before contacting the instructor or MAD for assistance.  The TAs are responsible for introducing new assignments and guiding you to learn concepts and software.  TAs will not give you answers to assignment questions.  You are responsible for maintaining <u>back-ups</u> of your work.</p><p><strong>Switching lab sections:</strong>  In rare instances, the instructor or TA may be consulted at the beginning of the course and a switch may be granted if room is available.</p><p><strong>Required course supplies:</strong></p><p>USB flash drive for backing up work.  Printing credit for lab assignment submissions, if necessary.</p><h4>LEARN Course Environment</h4><p>LEARN is a web-based course management system that enables instructors to manage course materials (posting of lecture notes, etc.), interact with their students (drop boxes for assignment submissions, discussion boards, course e-mail, etc.), and to provide feedback (grades, assignment comments, etc.).  Data files for all course modules will be found on LEARN.  Log onto LEARN using your Quest/UW userid and password here:  <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca">https://learn.uwaterloo.ca</a></p><h4>Resources</h4><p>ArcGIS Pro software is used for all lab work in this course.  Manuals are available as on-line help files. Students are expected to use the on-line help to obtain information on operations that are not fully detailed in the assignment.  Other resources will also be posted on the LEARN webpage.</p><h4>Required Course Supplies</h4><ul><li>A portable hard drive, USB thumb drive, or cloud storage for backing up work is required.</li><li>Students will normally access ArcGIS Pro software using computers in the Galileo GIS Lab (EV1, Room 240) or MAD General Use Lab.  In case pivoting to a remote teaching environment is required (short-term or longer-term), access to a computer that is able to run ArcGIS Pro software either locally installed on a Windows operating system or via remote access using a stable internet connection.</li></ul><h4>Lab Assignments</h4><p>Each module has a lab assignment, which may consist of one or multiple exercises (Modules 9 and 10 are combined into one lab assignment). Each module lab assignment is worth 6%. If a module has multiple exercises, these will sum to 6% weighting.  Labs are assigned and due at the start of your registered lab session in the week indicated.</p><p>All work for lab exercises within a module should be submitted according to the instructions provided in the exercises.  All submissions will be digital and must be submitted according to the instructions by the due date for grading.  Assignments should be properly formatted, clearly presented, and easy to read/follow.  Indicated time estimates for completing lab exercises are estimates only and do not account for technical troubleshooting.  Students are advised to leave ample time to complete assignments. Make sure to read and to follow lab assignment instructions carefully.</p><h4>Midterm Quiz and Final Exam</h4><p>The Midterm Quiz and Final Exams in the course are focused on assessing comprehension of lecture material and content.  The Midterm Quiz is scheduled during a scheduled lecture time slot, while the Final Exam is scheduled by the Registrar’s Office.  Both assessments may consist of multiple choice and short and long answer questions.  Exam responses should be properly formatted, clearly presented, and easy to read/follow for the purpose of grading. </p><p>Should in-person (midterm or final) assessments be cancelled or if there is a need to pivot to remote teaching, all quizzes or exams will be administered as take-home assignments instead, which will be released on LEARN and students will have a maximum timeframe of 3 days to complete the exams. The weighting of such assessments may also be adjusted.  Responses for an exam should be submitted as a single Word or PDF document to the designated LEARN dropbox by the due date for grading.</p><h4>Lab Attendance</h4><p>4% of the total grade has been allocated for lab attendance.  TAs will record lab attendance for each lab section. 1% of the total grade will be deducted for a recorded absence up to a maximum of four.  The TA and/or the instructor has the discretion to evaluate the lab attendance grade and to deduct marks for excessive tardiness, leaving labs excessively early, etc.</p><p>TAs will only grade assignments for students in their assigned lab section.  Therefore, students should only attend their assigned lab section, otherwise assignments submitted to a different session will not be graded.  If in-person learning is cancelled and it is necessary for labs to be delivered remotely, students will be exempt from lab attendance for virtual lab sessions and will be permitted to attend any virtual lab section that is scheduled.</p><h4>Late Penalty</h4><p>The penalty for late assignments is 10% of the total mark for the assignment per day (i.e., from the deadline to 24 hours after counts as the first day late), including any weekends, breaks/pause days, or holidays. Assignments will no longer be accepted after 7 days with a maximum penalty of 70% deduction.  The enforcement of a late penalty is to encourage lab assignments to be submitted on time and to facilitate the TA grading schedule.</p><p>If for some reason you are unable to submit your lab assignment by the due date, contact your TA and the instructor as soon as possible. Accommodations may be made on a case-by-case basis and if early enough notice is provided.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Alternate Arrangements for Cancelled In-Person Lectures:</strong></p><p>In-person lectures may be cancelled (as indicated in the course schedule or as announced in class) and a make-up class may be rescheduled, if required. If a make-up class is rescheduled, a date/time will be selected based on a class poll of availability and with majority agreement.  Maximum effort will be made to select a schedule conflict-free time. </p><p>If a make-up class is not rescheduled or if there is a need to pivot to a remote teaching environment during the term (for a short-term or longer-term duration), recorded lectures will be provided online (via LEARN) for asynchronous review.</p><p><strong>Alternate Arrangements for Cancelled In-Person Labs:</strong></p><p>Should there be a need to pivot to a remote teaching environment during the term (for a short-term or longer-term duration), lab sessions will migrate to an online synchronous format and hosted by TAs (WebEx links will be posted on LEARN).  Instructions for ArcGIS Pro software access will also be provided on LEARN with two options for, (a) installing the software onto your own Windows computer, or (b) via remote access, which requires a stable internet connection.</p><p><strong>Alternate Arrangements for Cancelled In-Person (Midterm or Final) Examinations:</strong></p><p>In the event of cancellation of in-person (midterm or final) examinations, such assessments will be administered as take-home examinations with digital submissions and a maximum timeframe of 3 working days to complete the examinations.  The weighting of course assignments may be adjusted by the instructor, if the need arises. Contingency course assessment weights will be applied to the entire class and not on an individual basis.  Further details and instructions will be provided on LEARN.</p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>.<br/><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Research Ethics:</strong> The University of Waterloo requires all research conducted by its students, staff, and faculty which involves humans as participants to undergo prior ethics review and clearance through the Director, Office of Human Research and Animal Care (Office). The ethics review and clearance processes are intended to ensure that projects comply with the Office’s Guidelines for Research with Human Participants (Guidelines) as well as those of provincial and federal agencies, and that the safety, rights and welfare of participants are adequately protected. The Guidelines inform researchers about ethical issues and procedures which are of concern when conducting research with humans (e.g. confidentiality, risks and benefits, informed consent process, etc.). If the development of your research proposal consists of research that involves humans as participants, the please contact the course instructor for guidance and see: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics</u></a></p><p><strong>Generative AI:</strong> This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
