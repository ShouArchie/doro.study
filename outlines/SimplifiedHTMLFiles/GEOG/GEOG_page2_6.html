  Student Assessment
</h2>
<div>There is no defined grading scheme for this course.</div>
<a></a>
<div></div>
<div>
<p><strong>What if I miss a deadline?</strong></p><p>Life happens. Life is important. Sometimes we all need time away from school or work for a multitude of reasons: because we get sick, due to a family bereavement, or perhaps a friend or relative needs our support. I hope your term goes smoothly, and that you don’t need to take any time off. But if you do, for whatever reason, then you shouldn’t need to worry about school; it’s just not as important as those other things. So, if you need to take time off during term, then please just take it. You don’t need to contact me (unless you want to), and I don’t need to see any doctor’s notes, or other documentation. </p><p>If a student tests positive for COVID-19, or they are directed to self-isolate by public health, they must not come to campus. They can continue to participate in the class through the online materials and assessments, and can receive support from the instructor via online office hours. Any student requesting additional accommodation must contact the instructor at their earliest convenience, and in most cases a voice or video meeting on MS Teams will be required to work out the details of the accommodation.</p>

</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Policy on email correspondence:</strong>  Face-to-face contact time with the instructor is available through office hours and during class at designated opportunities for questions.Students are strongly encouraged to attend office hours to discuss any issues related to the course, and email should be only considered secondary to this.  </p><p>If your question or concern cannot wait until the next class or office hour, then please remember these policies when sending email to the instructor:  </p><ul><li>Always send emails from your University of Waterloo email account.</li><li>It's best to send emails using the LEARN email tool, but if you use your own email tool then the subject line should include: “[GEOG490A/B] &lt;&lt;your subject here&gt;&gt;”</li><li>If your email includes an attachment, describe the contents of the attachment in the email.</li><li>Be polite, respectful, and professional.</li><li>Proofread your email and use correct grammar and punctuation.</li><li>Always use an appropriate greeting and sign your full name.</li><li>Allow the instructor at least two business days to respond before sending the request again. Mark all urgent matters “URGENT” in the subject line.</li><li>The instructor reserves the right to reply to you along with the entire class if the question is deemed to be relevant to other students on the course.</li></ul><p><strong>Backing up your data:</strong> Students are 100% responsible for maintaining backups of any files and data you have modified.  In computing the mantra is<i>: if it’s not in at least two places it doesn`t exist.</i>  Suitable options for backups include: portable USB flash drives; external hard drives; laptops, or home desktop PCs; online “cloud” storage.  No accommodation will be made for assignments handed in late due to lost or corrupted data. </p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office</p><p><strong>Policy on Generative AI</strong>: This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
