<p> </p><p><strong>Class Format:  :  </strong>This <strong>full credit </strong>course will be delivered in two format types.  First, it will include lectures delivered in person on campus on Tuesdays 8:30 – 11:30 in Room EV2 2006.  All lecture sessions will feature a 15-30 minute break part way through.  Over the term, class time will also occasionally be set aside for student group work including the entire class period on March 18<sup>th</sup>. Lectures will be content rich but designed to spark questions and dialogue during class.  There will be no tutorial sessions.  The course will likely feature a number of gues speakers joining us virtually and every effort will be made to schedule them during regular class hours.  Where it is not possible to do so, there may be times outside of regular class hours during which guest speakers will join us virtually.  Students are encouraged to attend such sessions but it is recognized that their schedules may not allow them to do so.  </p><p>There will be no online section in this course.  Lectures will not be recorded.</p><p><strong>Course Content Description:</strong></p><p>Housed in the Geography Department and cross-listed with ERS, 474, this course is situated within the Faculty’s thematic areas of climate change, resource management and sustainability and is designed to support the learning programs of students from across the Faculty as well as the university more broadly.  In addition to students from Environment, it is likely to appeal to students in other Faculties who have interests in environmental decision-making, policy and politics. </p><p>The course has both theoretical and practical dimensions.  On the theoretical plane, it starts from the central premise that for the most part, our collective efforts to manage and protect the fish, forests and wildlife resources of Canada are not succeeding no matter how “success” is defined.  With the goal of understanding why this is so and what to do about it lecture material and related readings invite students to consider “a conservation map” as a central metaphor for understanding how resource management in Canada functions today. The course then “maps out” the nature of modern day conservation programs and traces the evolution of three primary “layers” on conservation’s map – a subsistence layer, a market-based layer and an intrinsic value layer – and how they have given rise to the program suite that characterizes resource conservation and protected areas management in Canada today. The discussion then shifts to an identification of a set of common assumptions shared by the resource conservation systems flowing from these layers and argues that none of these assumptions are valid today.   Not surprisingly therefore, it is argued that the conservation map of today no longer works and that we need a new one.  It concludes with observations on what “Conservation’s New Map” could look like and how we might go about building it. </p><p>On the practical side, the course seeks to illustrate this theoretical framework in practice in the context of the federal government decision-making.  The course instructor is a “Practitioner-In-Residence" in the Faculty of Environment having recently retired from a 30-year Federal Public Service career that included senior level leadership roles in Parks Canada, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and Environment Canada.  Lecture material includes a substantial element of pragmatic examples and materials drawing upon this experience and focusses on federal decision making in the conservation domain with the goal of illustrating how the layers and dynamics referenced above apply in real life at the federal scale.  The course only briefly describes federal programs and structures and assumes that students will have a working knowledge of these topics based on earlier parts of their programs.  Instead, the focus is more on how conservation decisions are made and what factors, perspectives and information decision-makers themselves rely upon.  With that in mind, invited speaker will provide students direct, firsthand access to elected officials, senior bureaucrats and advocacy organizations from industry and the environmental community. </p><p>Further, the major assignments for the course have been designed to simulate federal decision-making products with a view to offering insight in to how these issues are dealt with in the Public Service today.  The goal is here is to simultaneously provide students with insights into conservation decision making and policy and to develop specific policy and process writing skills of direct utility in the labour market.</p>

<p><strong>Evaluation Elements Overview</strong></p><ol><li>Mid-Term “Three Layers” Essay Due byFebruary 23rd worth 25%</li><li>Issue Briefing Note Due by March 9<sup>th</sup> worth 20%</li><li>Group Presentation Deck Due March 23<sup>rd</sup> worth 20% </li><li>Revised Presentation Deck Due March 27<sup>th</sup> 5%</li><li>Final Paper due April 13<sup>th</sup> worth 30%</li></ol><p>The course has  “Assignment Topics”.  Students will be invited to select a Topic to work on and every effort will be made to assign each student to their first or second choice.  Depending on final class size, each topic will have ~5 students assigned to it. Students working on the same topic are encouraged, but not required, to connect with each other to share information, ideas and research workload.  Students will also be required to submit assignment 3 jointly as described below.  All other assignments are to be authored and submitted individually.  The four topics are as follows: </p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment Topics </strong></p><ol><li>In light of rapidly growing international shipping traffic and Canada’s expanding position in global trade, a proposal has been developed for dramatically expanding the Port of Vancouver’s container handling capacity.  Known as the Port Roberts Terminal Two Project (<a href="https://www.robertsbankterminal2.com/">https://www.robertsbankterminal2.com/</a>) this project will not only involve establishing a new container handling facility and related wharves, it will also lead to increased shipping traffic in the area. Given the importance of the proposed areas to a variety of coastal wildlife such as, for example, shorebird populations, as well as a wide variety of marine life including, among other species, the critically Endangered Southern Resident Killer Whale, should the government allow this project to proceed?  If so, under that, if any conditions should it do so.  If not, what alternatives to the project should it implement?  <br/> </li><li>Under the auspices of the federal Species At Risk Act (SARA) Boreal Caribou are Endangered throughout their range.   A variety of factors have been identified as contributing to the decline of the species and a range of actions to help it recover have been proposed. In considering this context, should the Government trigger the “habitat safety net” provisions of the Species At Risk Act and halt all logging in critical habitat areas of the Boreal Caribou?  How should it proceed to implement whichever decision it makes with respect to this question?<br/> </li><li>The Northern Cod fishery collapsed in the mid-eighties and remains closed to this day with the exception of a small stewardship fishery.  The Newfoundland fishing industry is in dire economic circumstances generally and has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic. Given this context, should the Government re-open the Northern Cod fishery to allow a harvest in a manner that re-kindles the industry in preparation for when stocks rebound to levels suitable for larger scale harvests?  If so, under what terms and conditions should the harvest proceed?  If not, how should the Government address the needs of the fishing communities of Newfoundland and Labrador?<br/> </li><li>The National Parks system administered by Parks Canada is based on a systems plan that commits the agency to establishing a National Park in each of the eco-regions identified in the Plan.  Three regions are currently un-represented including Region 3 in central BC.  In an effort to ensure that Natural Region 3 is represented in the Parks system, should the Government expropriate land in the Okanagan Valley area to establish a new national park that would eliminate the grazing of cattle and other economic activities in the area?   If so, how should it proceed to do so?  If not, how should the Government complete the Parks System for this Natural Region?</li></ol><p> </p><p>With a focus on your selected topic area the course assignments are as follows: </p><p> </p><p>With a focus on your selected topic area the course assignments are as follows:  </p><p><strong>1.         Mid-term “Three Layers” Essay </strong></p><p>As will be outlined in class, this courses presents a concept of featuring three layers on Canada’s biodiversity conservation map.  Drawing upon lecture materials, assigned readings, group discussions, and at least six additional references material you assemble through independent research, prepare at paper of approximately 2,000 words that: </p><ol><li>Describes the three layers on Conservation’s Map as outlined in the course.  The description should fully outline what each layer entails, how it evolved and what its implications are for conservation programming today.  In this regard, the paper <strong>does not </strong>need to describe the suite of conservation programs in place in Canada today though it certainly may do so if that makes sense as part of the description.  The point is to demonstrate understanding of the three layers and their significance, not to demonstrate mastery of Canadian conservation programs.  <br/><br/> </li><li>Discusses the implications of the three layers for your assignment topic.  How you approach this discussion is totally up to you.   The idea is to demonstrate insights and critical thinking with respect to the Indigenous, market and protectionist layers in the context of your issue.  Put another way, this part is to address the “well so what?” question one might reasonably ask at the end of part (a) above.  The idea here is to link theory to the practice and in doing so, to set you up for the final two course assignments as described below.  <br/><br/> </li></ol><p><strong>2.         Briefing Note </strong></p><p>            Following a format that will be discussed in class this Briefing Note is to be no more than two pages long <strong>not</strong> including a “References Cited” section.  The Briefing Note is to be drafted as though it is being presented to a Minister regarding your assignment topic.  It must follow the template to be discussed in class.  Students are encouraged, but not required, to work with the members of the group in thinking through the issue and how to describe it.  Students are required to submit the Note individually but may develop content jointly with their teammates if they wish.  Said differently, it is an individual assignment on which people may collaborate if they wish too. </p><p><strong>3.</strong>         <strong> Presentation Deck  </strong></p><p>Through group discussion and collaboration, prepare a ten-slide (maximum) presentation addressing your Assignment Topic.  The presentation should build on the readings, lecture material, the mid-term essay and insights provided by guest speakers.  The deck must summarize the issues at play and their background, identify key perspectives on the issue and propose a solution to it.  The presentation must also include an analysis of the proposed solution’s federal-provincial implications, its implications for key stakeholder groups, its gender implications, and a general indication of how the proposed approach would be implemented.  The deck should describe two not-recommended options but does not need to discuss them in depth.  The deck is to be submitted as a group assignment.  In the event that the group is not able to agree on a recommended option (it happens sometimes but is to be avoided if possible) the deck should present however many “recommended options” there are.    Group members will all receive identical marks.  Each deck will be presented in class on March 25<sup>th</sup> in a “mock Cabinet” format. </p><ol><li><strong>Revised final deck paper. </strong> </li></ol><p>As part of the Mock Cabinet sessions, each group will receive feedback on their presentation from fellow students speaking from the perspective of different Ministers as well as from the Prime Minister (the prof of course!) which will allow them to improve the content and format of the deck.  As happens in real life with respect to Cabinet presentations, the turnaround time on making revisions will be very brief with the revised version due 48 hours later.  In some cases, there may be very little updating required, in others there may be substantial changes needed.  Either way, the groups are advised to set aside at least a couple of hours to collaborate on the revision process. </p><p><br/><strong>5.         Final Term Paper - mock “Memorandum to Cabinet” (MC)  </strong></p><p><br/>Working individually, prepare a maximum 9 page <strong>(single spaced on 8.5” by 14” Legal Size paper using font 11)</strong> mock Memorandum to Cabinet that draws upon course readings, lecture materials, field trip speakers and previous assignments to address your assigned topic.   A modified version of the template used for real Cabinet presentations in the federal government will be posted in Learn and <strong>must be followed.</strong>  Guidance regarding its completion will be provided in lectures at several points in the course yet another reason it is a good idea to attend class.  In general terms, the MC must describe the issue, the background to it, three options for dealing with it, a detailed analysis of stakeholder perspectives on the proposed solution and a robust description of how the solution would be implemented if adopted.  The content is to be influenced by lecture materials, literature collected for assignment one, other literature and the views, insights and information garnered during the Ottawa field trip.  The paper is not to exceed nine single-spaced pages (not including a title page) plus a bibliography which will <strong>not</strong> count toward the page limit.<br/><br/> </p><p><strong>Late Policy for All Assignments</strong></p><p>This course is designed to give you exposure to life beyond the university. Consequently, a strict penalty of 5% per 24 hour period including weekends will be assigned to late work. All assignments are due to the relevant Dropbox on Learn by the time indicated for each assignment.</p>
