  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>GEOG 405:</div>
<p>Basic concepts on the distribution, classification, development, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecology of wetlands with an emphasis on temperate and boreal/subarctic systems. Human impacts, restoration and reclamation of wetlands are considered with the view of wetlands as functional ecosystems.</p>

<p>Wetlands are land areas with persistent saturation resulting in distinct soils, and vegetation adapted to wet conditions. There is a great variety of wetland types, since they are subject to the particular geomorphic setting in the landscape and the local climate. These high-level controls dictate the hydrological regime, biogeochemistry and ultimately the ecology, as shown in the diagram. Take a moment to reflect on the range of possible conditions dictated by the location in a landscape, and how these may vary in different climates, or if the climate changes. Wetlands provide billions of dollars of ecosystem services annually in Canada, including flood protection, water quality amelioration, carbon sequestration and habitat. Human activities including resource development, climate change and accidental contamination affect wetland function. Can these systems be restored? Can they be better managed? If so, only if they are well understood. This course examines the biophysical and geochemical processes associated with wetlands and wetland development, methods to identify, classify and systematically determine their value, examines human impacts on wetland functions, and considers approaches to restoration. This course will provide the essential information for your future career as environmental scientists, consultants, educators, regulators or policy-makers dealing with landscapes that include wetlands.</p><p>The course includes a major assignment in which you will use the Southern Ontario Wetland Evaluation System to score different wetlands and synthesize field data and information inferred from the literature. The goal of the course is to familiarize you with the science and issues relating to wetlands, so you are positioned to contribute to their protection and continued function.</p>

<p><strong>Independent Study: </strong></p><p>The Independent Study will be based on a wetland of your choice. You may work in groups of 2 or 3 to gather and assess the information you collect. This could include an assessment using SOWES, information from the regional data base (<a href="https://data.grandriver.ca)/"><u>https://data.grandriver.ca)</u></a>, flow information from the provincial data base (<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-watershed-information-tool-owit"><u>https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-watershed-information-tool-owit</u></a>), and site information on hydrology, soils, vegetation, local impacts, policies, management plans, etc. The report (5000 words; 30% of your final mark) should synthesize their regional context, contrasts, vulnerabilities and management options in addition to the SOWES assessment. The oral presentation (20% of your final mark) will be done by the group, and group members will receive the same grade. </p><p>All material is due at the beginning of class on the specified due date.  Late work will be subject to a late penalty of 10% off the total marks assigned for the exercise per day (including weekends). Assignments will not be accepted seven days after the due date. Special arrangements can be made when an assignment is late for university accepted, verifiable reasons beyond one’s control.  You must inform your professor immediately when such circumstances arise</p><p><strong>Quizzes:</strong></p><p>There will be five quizzes each worth 10%. They will be based on the materials of the preceding several lectures and assigned readings. The tests will be online, posted on as shown on the itinerary table below, and each quiz will be 30 minutes in length. You have one week to complete the quiz unless indicated otherwise.</p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
