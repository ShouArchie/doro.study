<div>
<div>GEOG 101:</div>
<p>An introduction to human geography through key subfields of the discipline, examining population change, the rise of cities, our relationship to nature, social inequalities, economic forms, cultural difference and environmental change at the local and global scale.</p>

<p><strong>Course Organisation: </strong>The course revolves around the concept of “Sustainability/Sustainable Development” as explored through Human Geography. The fundamentals of human geography are explored in the first part of the course, followed by an examination of spatial interaction and migration, and population and health aspects of human geography. So-called “food geography” is then explored, followed by an examination of the geographic basis of patterns of urbanization, and an exploration of global economic activity. The course concludes with a short unit on hazards geography, analysis of global development patterns and processes, and an assessment of human impacts on and sustainability in terrestrial and marine environments. For Winter 2025, course content will be delivered through a combination of in-class lectures and self-viewed readings and videos. </p><p>The course explained in graphic form: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/E2FiOkG.png">https://i.imgur.com/E2FiOkG.png</a></p>

You will however have to provide a detailed typed/emailed explanation of why you missed a test or were late in submitting an assignment. Examples:<br/>-Significant personal or family emergency, death in the family, etc<br/>-Other valid reasons beyond the control of the student (to be approved on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the instructor).<br/></p>

<div></div>
<div>
<p><strong>QUIZ details</strong>: All quizzes will be completed via LEARN (using the "submit" tab). Quizzes will remain open for a period of five days, after which the submission window will close. Once you begin a quiz you will generally have 90 -120 minutes to complete all questions (varies depending on the quiz length), but you will not have the option to "stop the clock" (i.e. you must continue to take the quiz until you are done or until the clock runs out). All quizzes are open book (i.e. you can use your notes, readings and the PPT lectures provided in class) but I strongly recommend that you do NOT use the internet or Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) to find answers since these answers <u>may not correspond with information given in class.</u><strong><u> </u>To be clear, internet-based and ChatGPT answers will NOT be accepted as correct if they contradict information that has been provided to you in class/readings/PPTs</strong>. Each quiz will feature a number of questions <u>derived from the lectures/powerpoints, readings, online videos, and from materials discussed during lectures (but not necessarily written on the powerpoints)</u>. From this, most GEOG 101 students will conclude that <u>attending regularly</u>, and keeping up with lectures, assigned readings and assigned videos is a really, really, REALLY good idea. </p><p><strong>Policy on Group Work: </strong>All quizzes and assignments are to be completed <u>individually</u>. No group work or collaboration is allowed on any quiz or assignment. </p><p><strong>Assignment details</strong>: Assignment #1 is detailed below. Assignment #2 details will be provided once the course gets underway. </p><p><strong><u>Assignment #1 (20%): Understanding the SDGs</u></strong></p><p><u>Summary</u>: a short assignment in which you choose one of the 17 SDGs and explore how “your SDG” is being translated into real world sustainability action.  <strong>Due: February 14th</strong></p><p><u>Directions:</u> </p><ol><li>Begin by generating a list of all of the SDGs using ChatGPT or some other online source. Either screenshot or copy the entire list to create page 1 of your assignment.</li><li>Choose the one SDG that most interests you, connects with your current program of study or employment, or has some connection to your family or friends or a person you admire.</li><li>Explain why you chose the SDG that you chose.</li><li>Carry out online research to find an example of a real world <strong>project, program or intervention which is being guided by your SDG</strong>. For example, if you choose SDG 13, you would find a real world example of a project which is reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing carbon sinks, regenerating forests, reducing or eliminating methane gas releases, etc. You may wish to focus on a specific city or country that you have spent time in, grew up in, etc, to make the assignment more meaningful. You could also focus on a large institution (e.g. University of Waterloo, A federal government agency like Health Canada) which has been altered somehow through SDG actions.</li><li>Describe this real world initiative, connecting your explanation of your SDG to the real world initiative.</li><li>There is <u>no need to go beyond 3-4 pages for full marks</u>.</li></ol><p><strong><u>Assignment Components </u></strong><u>(45 total marks available)</u></p><ul><li><strong>Section 1: List of all SDGs </strong>(single screenshot or copied list) (5 marks)</li><li><strong>Section 2: Summary of your SDG, and explanation of why you chose it. </strong>You MUST explain <u>why this SDG is important to you personally</u>...it connects to your personal interests, your program of study, your background, your current job, your family or friends, etc. <strong> </strong>(150-250 words…10 marks)</li><li><strong>Section 3: Description of a real world initiative</strong> (project/program/intervention) guided by your SDG (350-500 words…25 marks)<ul><li>Using the questions "Who/what/when/where/why/how" as a rough starting point, describe to the reader in your own words who is leading your initiative, what the initiative is comprised of or focuses on, when the initiative was first launched, where the initiative is intended to operate, why the initiative was started, and how the initiative connects to your SDG.  [NOTE: the "Who/what/when/where/why/how" questions are just idea prompts…you do NOT have to use those exact words in your description, so please feel free to use your own vocabulary and writing style!].</li><li>Note that you will have to spend some time to find an appropriate initiative (e.g. something that has enough written about it, or is described clearly enough). So if you find yourself making a few false starts at the beginning, don’t worry, this is normal! Please feel free to reach out to a TA to help you with this stage, or to drop in to my office hours.</li><li>As much as possible, try to find clear evidence that your real world initiative was actually <u>motivated </u>by the SDGs/your SDG (i.e. the initiative is not just vaguely connected. Try to find a quote like "...project __ was created by the __ government in order to make progress on SDG #<i><strong> </strong></i><strong>__</strong>")</li></ul></li><li><strong>Section 4: Reference List/Sources of Information: </strong>at the end of your assignment list all sources you have used to complete the assignment. Like most University assignments, you must properly cite ALL information you have obtained (using Chicago style in text citation format, otherwise known as "the author/date (Smith 2021)" style), and you MUST put all information in your own words unless you use quotation marks.<strong> </strong>(5 marks)</li></ul><p><u>Expected time for completion:</u> approximately 3-4 hours </p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong><u>Assignment 2 (20%): </u>Urban Sustainability Mind Map <u>Due: Mar. 23rd, 11:59pm</u></strong></p><p>(details to be provided before Reading Week.

The following text is recommended:<br/><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, <strong>sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights</strong>. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a <strong>violation of intellectual property rights</strong>.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (GenAi)</strong></p><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used to assist to help generate ideas for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Recommendations for how to cite GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. <strong>In general, generative AI should ONLY be used to brainstorm ideas and themes, check your own work to make sure you haven't missed something, etc - NOT to do your writing for you! Please also be aware that "getting away with it" now does not mean your work will not be checked again sometime in the future when AI detection technology becomes better (i.e. students have had their degrees <u>revoked </u>retroactively due to plagiarism discovered YEARS after graduation).  </strong></p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence  You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI.</p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting. When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations. Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/ about/equity-office3 </p><p><strong>Late Assignments: </strong>Late assignments will have 5<strong>% deducted for each day an assignment is late</strong>. <strong>Please note that <u>Assignment #2 will NOT be accepted after April 7th </u></strong>since TAs need time to mark the assignment and then I need to submit final grades before the end of term. The instructor reserves the right to waive this deduction if the following prevents the student from handing in an assignment on time:</p><ul><li><u>Valid medical reason</u> such as illness or accident (appropriate explanation is required);</li><li><u>Personal or family emergency</u> (with suitable explanation);</li><li><u>Other valid reasons beyond the control of the student</u> (to be approved on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the instructor).</li></ul><p>NOTE: If you know in advance that you will not be able to meet a particular deadline <strong>for any reason</strong>, please contact the instructor to make alternative arrangements. Also note that late assignments will not be accepted after marked assignments are released on LEARN. Please ensure that you are diligent in <i>backing up computer files</i> and making <i>draft</i> <i>copies</i> of all assignments, as computer/disk failures, printer problems, etc, will <u>not be considered a valid reason to waive the late assignment deduction</u>. Also, double and triple check that your assignment file can be opened and read - <strong>If you submit an assignment file that is corrupted (i.e. cannot be open by the TA/instructor, or contains gibberish) the assignment will be graded as a “0”. PDF format is the only accepted format for assignments.</strong></p><p><strong>Downloading Notes: </strong>Powerpoint notes for lectures will be posted to LEARN throughout the term. It is recommended that you <u>download </u>and save these notes. Do NOT rely on the availability of LEARN notes stored ‘in the cloud’ … LEARN has periodically gone down for as long as 3 days (see this news article for details: <a href="https://www.therecord.com/business/2013/02/01/desire2learn-in-recovery-mode-says-there-has-been-no-data-loss-to-university-systems.html">https://www.therecord.com/business/2013/02/01/desire2learn-in-recovery-mode-says-there-has-been-no-data-loss-to-university-systems.html</a> ). In case you are still not convinced, imagine you have an online quiz, begin the quiz, realize you need to check something in the lecture notes, and the system is “down”!</p><p><strong>Non-lecture content (Online readings, videos, etc): </strong>Approximately 20% of course content is delivered through non lecture format (video clips, online readings), and ALL of this material is valid testing/quiz material. Therefore, each student should review this material and take notes. </p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
