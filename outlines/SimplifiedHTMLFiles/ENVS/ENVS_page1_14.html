<p><strong>How to succeed in ENVS 278:</strong></p><p>Each week the course covers a different statistical method for a different type of application. To be successful, students are expected to spend 5-7 hours each week completing the following tasks:</p><ol><li>Attend the two weekly lectures. Lecture 1 (Monday) is a content lecture where new concepts are introduced and explained. Lecture 2 (Wednesday) helps solidify foundational understanding of the content for each module, through a series of examples and demonstrations. Participate in class using Vevox (accessed through LEARN).</li><li>Complete the MyLab homework to solve a series of practice problems and solidify learning. Multiple attempts are allowed on each assessment.</li><li>Attend and participate in a Problem-Solving Session (Tuesday; guided by a TA) that focuses on interpreting and communicating the output from a statistical analysis.</li><li>Post additional questions on the Discussion Forum on LEARN for additional support, review the relevant textbook chapters where needed.</li></ol><p>The course content is incremental: one week’s material builds on the previous week’s. This makes it more difficult to catch up after missing a class or two, and so it makes good sense to keep on top of the workload each week. This course has a reputation for being “difficult”, but I think that means it forces students out of their comfort zone. History has shown that all students have the potential to do well in this class, regardless of their background in math and statistics, if they commit to applying themselves consistently throughout the term. While ENVS278 requires more math than other courses in the Faculty, the math is Grade 9-10 level in Ontario high schools, and the Instructor and TAs are here to assist you. If you complete all the activities each week, you will gain confidence by seeing that solving statistical problems is actually not that difficult at all.</p><p> </p><p><strong>More about the tests:</strong></p><p>Two non-cumulative tests will assess student progress on material covered up to and including the week before the test. The tests will be conducted <i><strong>in-person</strong></i> during the Thursday class time. It may include calculation and short-answer questions, and will assess student’s ability to interpret the output from statistical analyses. Some calculations may be required during the tests, and students may use a calculator to complete them. </p><p>As part of the test booklet, students will be provided all relevant statistical tables and equations. </p><p><strong>More about the final exam:</strong></p><p>A compulsory cumulative final examination (date to be announced in the middle of term) will examine students’ knowledge of all concepts covered in the class. </p><p>Students may bring<strong> one DOUBLE-SIDED handwritten</strong> page of study notes into the final exam room (US letter paper 8.5x11in, <strong>DOUBLE</strong>-sided, no flaps, no photocopies). The study notes may contain any materials that the student chooses. Note that students are <strong><u>not</u></strong> expected to include statistical tables as part of their study notes (the tables take up too much space). If any statistical tables are required for the exam, they will be provided to students on the question booklet.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What happens if I miss a class or an assessment item?</strong></p><p>Life happens. Life is important. <strong>This course employs a flexible grading scheme to help alleviate some of the stress and anxiety associated with school</strong>. Sometimes we all need time away from school or work for a multitude of reasons: because we get sick, due to a family bereavement, or perhaps a friend or relative needs our support. I hope your term goes smoothly, and that you don’t need to take any time off. But if you do, for whatever reason, then you shouldn’t need to worry about school; it’s just not as important as those other things. So, if you need to take time off during term, then please just take it. You don’t need to contact me (unless you want to), and I don’t need to see any doctor’s notes, or other documentation.</p><p>The following apply equally to all students:</p><ul><li>If you need to miss a MyLab quiz, then just miss it: the three lowest quiz grades (including zeros) will be automatically dropped for all students.</li><li>If you need to miss a Problem-Solving Session, then just miss it: the three lowest grades (including zeros) will be automatically dropped for all students.</li><li>If you need to miss one test, then just miss it: the weight of each student’s lowest test will automatically be redistributed to the other course assessment items proportional to each item's contribution to the final grade. The reweighting is a complicated calculation, so it's not easy to predict in advance what any student's final grade will be. However, a student's grade <strong>will never go down</strong> as a result of reweighting, and most students will see a modest increase in their grade. The reweighting is applied to all students' marks at the end of term, regardless of whether they wrote the test, or not.</li></ul><p>Due to the size of the class <strong>no extensions will be offered for any assessment item</strong>, and there are no alternative (make-up) dates to sit the tests or final exam. On rare occasions, students may require more than the default accommodation provided through the flexible grading scheme. Any student requesting additional accommodation must contact the Instructor at their earliest convenience, and in most cases a voice or video meeting will be required to work out the details of the accommodation.</p>

Verbal requests for regrades will not be accepted.</li><li>When writing your request, please follow the policy on student email (see below).</li><li>Be as specific as possible and list all relevant details, e.g., “<i>my marks were summed incorrectly for questions 1–5</i>”.</li><li>If another student’s work is used as an example or reason for an error in grading, both assignments will be subject to a re grade.</li><li>The entire assignment will be regraded, not the just the errors indicated in the written request.</li></ul><p>The resulting grade may increase or decrease depending on the result of the regrading.</p><h3>Absences</h3><p>There are three types of absences which entitle students to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?q=absences&amp;&amp;limit=20&amp;skip=0&amp;bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcItemType=policies"><u>academic considerations</u></a>.</p><p>Short term (2 day) self-declared absences: undergraduate students are entitled to one two-day absence per term during the formal lecture period only. If students need academic considerations for tests or other assessments due during this period, they must contact you within 24 hours of declaring the absence. Students declare short-term absences via <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students"><u>Quest</u></a>. Students requesting extensions for personal reasons should be directed to this absence.</p><p>Covid self-declared absences: for students with symptoms of Covid-19, one absence up to ten days is available per term, including the examination period. Students can only use this for known or suspected Covid; all other illnesses requiring considerations must be documented. Students need to contact you for academic consideration as soon as possible. It is possible for a student to declare for fewer than 10 days, and then extend the absence if symptoms have not improved during the shorter absence. While this absence is available for Fall 2024, it will be discontinued at some point in the future.</p><p>Documented absences, including Verification of Illness: for illnesses other than Covid which require consideration, as well as other documented circumstances (e.g. funerals). Students submit documentation to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/environment-faculty-staff-resources/teaching/vif.uwaterloo.ca"><u>vif.uwaterloo.ca</u></a>, and absences are approved/denied on a case by case basis. Documented absences can occur during both the lecture and exam period, and there is no formal limit on the number of days a student can miss. If a student misses enough time that you are concerned that they cannot feasibly achieve the learning outcomes, please contact the associate dean, undergraduate studies. Students should not submit documentation to course instructors, please do not accept this. Students need to contact instructors for academic considerations as soon as feasible under their individual circumstances.</p><p>All absences for students in your class can be viewed at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/environment-faculty-staff-resources/teaching/vif.uwaterloo.ca"><u>vif.uwaterloo.ca</u></a></p><p><strong>Policy on student email: </strong>Most information students need is found in this course outline, so please review it carefully before contacting the instructor or TAs. The LEARN Discusion forums (for which participation grades are awarded) are the preferred means of answering procedural questions. Office hours are available by appointment either in-person or online. Students are strongly encouraged to attend office hours to discuss any issues related to the course, and email should only be used when none of these other options is appropriate. The Instructor and the TAs will not respond to emails if students have not first attempted to find an answer using these other means.</p><p>However<i>, if your question or concern cannot wait until the next lecture or office hour </i>then please remember these policies when sending email to the instructor or TAs:</p><ul><li><strong>Always send emails from your University of Waterloo email account or from the email tool within UW LEARN</strong>.</li><li>All emails should have the following subject line: “ENVS278: &lt;&lt;insert your subject here&gt;&gt;”</li><li>The Instructor should be copied on all course-related email communication with the TAs (TAs are under instructions not to respond to emails that do not cc the Instructor).</li><li>If your email includes an attachment, describe the contents of the attachment in the email. Be polite, respectful and professional.</li><li>Proofread your email and use correct grammar and punctuation.</li><li>Always use an appropriate greeting, and sign your full name.</li><li>Allow the Instructor or TA at least two business days to respond before sending the request again. Mark all urgent matters “URGENT” in the subject line.</li><li>The Instructor and TAs reserve the right to reply to you along with the entire class, if the question is deemed to be relevant to other students on the course. Alternatively, we may post the question and response in a discussion forum on the LEARN Discussion Forums. The questioner’s identifying personal information will be removed from such announcements.</li></ul><p><strong>Student collaboration: </strong>All assignments are to be completed <u>individually by each student</u>. There is no group work in this course. Assessments are expected to be the student’s original work and to reflect her/his own thinking. Please do not collaborate on assessed work: <strong>the penalties for doing so are severe and not worth the risk</strong>.</p><p><strong>Readability and clarity</strong>: Students are expected to present well organized and properly written work. The Instructor and TAs reserve the right not to grade work that does not conform to normal standards of academic writing and/or organization.</p><p><strong>Assignment submission</strong>: Students will submit their work for Problem-solving classes using the Crowdmark platform. The easiest way is to use your smartphone to take a photo of your hand-written work and upload that directly into Crowdmark (note: Apple users must not use the compressed .HEIC image format, use .JPEG instead). Emailed submissions will not be accepted under any circumstances.</p><p><strong>Late work will not be graded</strong>: all assignments are due on the date set by the Instructor. Teaching assistants are NOT allowed to change the due dates. There are no late penalties: any work that is submitted after the stated deadline (yes, even if it is submitted 1 minute after the dropbox closes), without appropriate documentation, will not be graded.</p><p><strong>Contingency Plans for Covid-19: </strong>The University of Waterloo wants to ensure students are kept healthy and safe in the current state of the Covid-19 pandemic. The class will follow all current guidance from public health and the University administration. Students will be notified by email in the event of any cancellation of classes, and kept informed throughout the cancellation as to what is currently known about when classes will resume.</p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their Instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the Instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an Instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, Instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the Instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> </p><p>Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p>
