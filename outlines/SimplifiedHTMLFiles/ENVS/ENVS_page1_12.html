<p>This course provides an engaging introduction to ecological economics, framed through the lens of Doughnut Economics by Kate Raworth. Designed for students from diverse academic backgrounds, no prior knowledge of economics is required. Together, we will explore how ecological economics challenges the assumptions of conventional economics and expands its scope to address the pressing challenges of sustainability, equity, and planetary boundaries.  The course begins by defining ecological economics, distinguishing it from traditional economic theories and environmental and resource economics. Using the Doughnut model as a central guide, we will examine the concept of a “safe and just space for humanity” and the interplay between social foundations and ecological ceilings.  </p><p>Key topics include:  </p><ul><li><strong>Rethinking Growth: </strong>Investigating the limits of economic growth, the role of natural resources, and critiquing growth-centric paradigms.</li><li><strong>Redefining Progress: </strong>We will compare conventional measures like GDP with alternative metrics such as ecological footprints, planetary boundaries, and well-being and indices of human to assess their relevance in shaping policy and decision-making.</li><li><strong>Equity and Justice: </strong>Exploring themes of inequality, just distribution, and global economic dynamics. Special attention will be given to the intersection of ecological economics with issues like climate justice, social equity, and intergenerational ethics.</li><li><strong>Tools for Change: </strong>Evaluating policies and strategies, including taxes, subsidies, quotas, emissions trading, and innovative approaches like circular economies and regenerative practices. We will analyze their effectiveness through both economic and ecological perspectives.</li><li><strong>Globalization and Local Action:</strong> Understanding the environmental implications of globalization and the role of local communities in driving sustainable change.</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office</p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>. The following text is recommended:<br/><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement.
