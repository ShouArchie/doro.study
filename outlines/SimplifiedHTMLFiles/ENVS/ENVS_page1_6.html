<p>This first-year course introduces the field of environmental studies, exploring the relationships and interactions between humans and their natural, social, and built environments. Over the duration of the course, we will: </p><ol><li>Explore the variety of demographic, economic, and socio-cultural/ethical processes underlying human interaction with the natural world;</li><li>Develop an understanding of the planetary systems and processes that have been disturbed by human activity and contribute to the environmental challenges that we face today;</li><li>Critically analyze specific environmental challenges we face as global citizens and some of the key debates / proposed solutions related to these challenges. These environmental challenges will be studied at the global, national and local levels, and the complexity and interconnectedness of these various challenges are examined; and</li><li>Examine key planning and management approaches, concepts, and frameworks that may be useful for responding to environmental challenges. </li></ol><p>The course promotes acquisition of core environmental knowledge (concepts, principles, practices) from the perspectives of social sciences, environmental sciences, and management. An interdisciplinary, mixed-methods teaching approach is used throughout the course to help make learning meaningful for students. Lectures, videos, case studies, in-class discussions and activities, and assessment activities are designed to provide students the opportunity to explore and analyze environmental issues from a variety of perspectives.</p><p> </p>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Citing Guidelines: </strong></p><p>Students are expected to source/cite all materials, information, ideas, and data taken from any sources using APA citation formatting. This includes information used from the textbook, lecture/textbook/assigned readings, and any additional sources used to inform the assignment. Information that is paraphrased should include a citation in the author, date format (Smith, 2025). Information that “is quoted directly should be written in quotation marks and cited with the author, date, page/paragraph number format” (Smith, 2025, p. 17). Direct quotations should be used whenever five or more words in a row are copied directly; however, you may use terminology related to concepts and processes without needing to quote directly (e.g., the term <i>phenological mismatch</i> does not need to be in quotation marks). A bibliography should be included at the end of each assignment, with full bibliographic information for all sources listed in alphabetical order. Note that only sources cited in-text should be included in the bibliography. </p><p>Lecture content can be cited using the following template: </p><p>O’Connell, E. (2025, Jan 8). Nature: Perspectives, Values and Rights - Part I: Environmental Value Systems  [PowerPoint Slides]. Lecture notes from ENVS 195, Faculty of Environment, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada. </p><p>When citing lectures in-text, you can just cite the title of the lecture: (Environmental Value Systems, 2025).</p><p>For more details and information on citing using the APA citation style, please see the ‘APA Citation Guide’ provided by the University of Waterloo: </p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/resources-apa-style-citation">https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/resources-apa-style-citation</a></p><p>Or the APA citation guide provided by Purdue University: </p><p><a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html">https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html</a>.</p><p><strong>Submitting Assignments:</strong></p><p>All assignments should be submitted via LEARN. Students should make arrangements for their assignments to be submitted to the appropriate dropbox on LEARN by the time and date indicated in the weekly schedule. Assignments should not be handed to the professor in class or emailed to the professor. LEARN provides a date and time stamp for all assignments submitted to the dropbox – this will be the date used to determine any late penalties that will be applied.</p><p><strong>Late Assignments:</strong></p><p>Assignments should be submitted by the due dates outlined in the course schedule (also see deadlines noted for each dropbox). However, a three-day grace period will be applied for the three written assignments in the course (i.e., the grace period does not apply to readings quizzes, in-class participation, and the final exam). The grace period means that you can submit any assignment up to three days late without explanation or penalty. To encourage students to submit on time, a bonus mark will be applied based on the following submission dates: </p><ul><li>Submitted by the original due date at 11:59pm: 3% bonus added to assignment grade</li><li>Submitted within 24 hours of the original due date: 2% bonus added to assignment grade</li><li>Submitted within 48 hours of the original due date: 1% bonus added to assignment grade</li><li>Submitted within 72 hours of the original due date: no bonus and no late deduction</li></ul><p>Assignments submitted after the three-day grace has ended will have a late deduction applied at the rate of 10% per day off the assignment grade. </p><p><i><strong>NOTE:</strong></i> There is no need to email the instructor or TA to have this grace period applied – you can simply submit your assignment at any point within the grace period without penalty. </p><p>Assignments will not be accepted after the grading has been completed and feedback made available for students. </p><p>In some cases, concessions may be made for exceptional circumstances. Note that for any exception, students will need to demonstrate (with documentation) why they were unable to complete the work prior to the original deadline, as well as the during the grace period. For this reason, you should treat the specific deadline as the ‘actual’ deadline and only use the grace period if needed. Exceptional circumstances may include: </p><ul><li>Valid medical reason such as illness or accident (appropriate proof such as a Doctor’s note is required);</li><li>Personal or family emergency (with suitable proof where possible); and</li><li>Other valid reasons beyond the control of the student (to be approved on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the instructor).</li></ul><p><i><strong>NOTE:</strong></i> If you know in advance that you will not be able to meet a particular deadline for any reason, please contact the instructor to see if alternative arrangements can be accepted.</p><p><strong>Short Term Absence Declarations</strong></p><p>Short-term absence declaration will be dealt with as follows: </p><ol><li><u>Reading Quizzes and In-Class Participation Activities:</u> students can either count a missed quiz or activity as one of the already included dropped grades OR contact the professor to have a missed reading quiz or in-class participation activity re-weighted towards the final exam in the course.</li><li><u>Written Assignments:</u> short-term absence declarations only apply to the original due dates on assignments. The absence declaration will not impact the end date of the grace period; this means that if you use the three-day grace period, a short-term absence declaration on the final day of the grace period will not result in an additional two days to submit the assignment. This essentially removes the need for a short-term absence declaration, since a longer, three-day grace period has already been applied.</li><li><u>Final Exam:</u> short-term absence declarations cannot be used during the final exam period.</li></ol><p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience.  <strong>However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.</strong>  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository). </p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights. </p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.  The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/ about/equity-office3 </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.
