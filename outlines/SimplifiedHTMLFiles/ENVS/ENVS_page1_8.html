  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ENVS 200:</div>
<p>Introduces the main concepts and principles of ecology; the cycling of elements; energetics and structural organization of major ecological systems; population dynamics; impact of natural resource management practices and urban and industrial development on the environment; incorporating environmental quality considerations into development activities. The lab sessions include field trips to study natural and disturbed ecosystems, urban and applied ecology.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Ecology is the study of the relationship of organisms with their environments (including other organisms). In this sense, this course is neither more nor less than getting to know the basic principles by which the organisms that share our planet—including ourselves—live their lives and interact with one another. It is a course about life on Earth. Such knowledge, called ecoliteracy, will provide a critical basis for your engagement in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the “century of the environment”—not least because so many of the environmental issues we face derive in part from a limited understanding of how we are embedded within and dependent upon ecological systems. Field ecology necessarily harbours an ethical component both because of our natural affinity for life (or ‘biophilia’) and because questions of ecological ‘impact’ and 'quality’ are necessarily value-laden. </p><p>On a weekly basis, this offering of ENVS200 will include an in-person lecture, textbook readings, interactive in-lecture "quizzes" and polls and hands-on lab activities. <u>You are expected to keep up with weekly textbook readings, so that lectures can focus on going further and expanding on the reading materials.</u> This is a university level course, so I want you to become engaged in the issues rather than focusing on ‘knowing all the answers.’ My aim is to introduce you to the worldview of ecology so that you can be more aware of the beauty, diversity, and complexity of the life around us. </p><p>In summary, this course introduces the main concepts and principles of ecology; the cycling of elements; energetics and structural organization of major ecological systems; population dynamics; impact of natural resource management practices and urban and industrial development on the environment; incorporating environmental quality considerations into development activities. The lab sessions include field trips to study natural and disturbed ecosystems, urban and applied ecology.</p>

<p>The course has been design so that assessment aligns with our learning outcomes as indicated in the following table. Teaching and assessment will occur in a variety of ways to suit different learning styles. The learning outcomes will be developed through regular activities in preparation for major course assessments (i.e., midterm exam, lab activities, and final exam). <br/><br/> </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Learning outcome </strong></td><td><strong>Teaching and learning activities </strong></td><td><strong>Assessment methods</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>i.</strong> identify and explain, with examples, the main principles of ecology</td><td>Lectures, Readings, Labs</td><td>Weekly lecture quizzes and activities, exams, lab activities, discussion forums</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ii.</strong> demonstrate how these principles apply to real-world situations, including human interactions with the natural world</td><td>Readings, Labs, Discussion board</td><td>Weekly lecture quizzes and activities, exams, lab activities, discussion forums</td></tr><tr><td><strong>iii. </strong>articulate the elements of scientific inquiry as they apply to ecology</td><td>Readings, Labs, Discussion board</td><td>Exams, lab activities, discussion forums</td></tr><tr><td><strong>iv.</strong> evaluate ecological arguments presented in the media and elsewhere</td><td>Readings, Labs, Discussion board</td><td>Exams, discussion forums</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Grade Breakdown:</h2><h4><strong>10%    In Lecture Weekly "Quizzes" and Activities</strong></h4><p>There will be nine weekly "quizzes" or activities throughout the course, indicated by an asterisk (*) on the course schedule. These quizzes are worth a total of 10% of your final grade. To provide flexibility, <i><u>only your top seven quiz grades will count.</u></i> This allows you to miss a lecture or drop a low grade if needed.</p><p>The quizzes will focus on the weekly readings and will be administered in lecture through Vevox. They will be integrated into lecture activities, including breakout sessions, where you’ll share your ideas, thoughts, or questions about the course content.</p><p>Some quizzes will have correct and incorrect answers, while others will be participation-based, where thoughtful engagement matters more than accuracy. These quizzes will also serve as practice for the midterm and final exams by introducing you to similar question formats. Additionally, they will help spark lecture discussions, allowing us to explore key course concepts more deeply.</p><h4><strong>28%    Lab activities (in-lab and field assessment)</strong></h4><p>Each week there will be a series of lab activities such as calculations, organism identification, and other queries to complete. There will be outdoor and hands-on components for you to do. </p><h4><strong>18% Lab Attendance and Participation (Highest 8 grades count)</strong></h4><p>Attending labs is a crucial part of ENVS 200, just as important as attending lectures. Lab material will be tested on the exams, making your active participation essential for success.</p><p>Each lab includes specific activities designed to provide hands-on experience with various ecological assessment techniques. To get the most out of these sessions, come prepared with the appropriate gear and learning materials, and be ready to engage meaningfully with the lab content. These experiences are intended to help you apply ecological concepts in real-world contexts while building valuable field skills.</p><p>Your lab attendance and participation grade will be based on how actively you engage with lab activities, collaborate with your peers, and interact constructively with your TA. Showing up to lab on time and staying engaged throughout the session is essential. Consistent preparation, respectful communication, and meaningful contributions will help you succeed. <strong>Professionalism is a key component of your grade—this includes punctuality, preparation, and active participation in all aspects of the lab.</strong> Lab doors will close 15 minutes after the start time, and late arrivals may not be allowed to enter. Be prepared for the weather and the possibility of outdoor activities, as the lab will often involve fieldwork - this is part of the professionalism component. </p><p>If you are going to miss your lab, please inform your TA as soon as possible.</p><p>Only your top eight lab attendance and participation grades will count toward your final mark (worth 18% total), giving you flexibility to drop or miss one lab while still encouraging regular involvement. See LEARN for a grading rubric.</p><p>Permission to attend a different lab session is not guaranteed. You must email the TA of the lab session you wish to attend and cc your regular lab’s TA prior to your lab. Approval is at the discretion of the TA for the lab session you wish to attend.</p><p>If you miss a lab and there is an in-lab activity or assignment submitted during that lab worth 2% of your final grade, this 2% will be evenly distributed across the rest of your course grade.</p><h4><strong>22% Midterm exam</strong></h4><p>The midterm exam will be a combination of multiple choice and short answer questions that will assess your knowledge on topics covered in the lectures (lectures 1 - 5), readings (up to Ch. 6, Ch. 7 &amp; 8.3), and lab materials (labs 1-4). The exam will be in-person during class time on February 11, 2025. See below for the Administrative Policy on reporting documented absences and what happens if you need to miss the midterm. You must report your absence and have it approved in order to miss the midterm and not receive a zero. </p><h4><strong>22% Final exam</strong></h4><p>The final exam will follow a format similar to the midterm and will cover both course and lab material, primarily from the midterm onward. It will be held in-person during class time on April 1, 2025. If you miss the final class, the exam will be rescheduled for the exam make-up days at the very end of the exam period.</p><h2><strong>Late Assignment Policy:</strong></h2><h4><strong>“Life Happens Pass” and Extended Deadlines</strong></h4><p>Understanding that unexpected challenges can arise, you will be given one “Life Happens Pass.” This pass allows you to waive the late penalty for <strong>one assignment submitted up to one week late</strong>. Please note that this pass <strong>only applies to assignments submitted through LEARN</strong> and <strong>does not apply to in-lab assignments or activities submitted during your lab sessions.</strong></p><p><strong>How to Use the Life Happens Pass:</strong></p><ul><li>When submitting a late assignment through LEARN, indicate “Life Happens Pass” in the comments section.</li><li>The late penalty will be removed automatically.</li><li>You may only use this pass once during the term.</li></ul><p><strong>Extended Deadlines and Late Penalties:</strong><br/>For all other assignments submitted through LEARN (<strong>does not apply to in-lab assignments or activities submitted during lab sessions</strong>):</p><ul><li><strong>First 48 hours after the due date:</strong> 5% late penalty applied for the entire 48-hour period.</li><li><strong>After 48 hours:</strong> An additional 5% penalty will be applied for every 24-hour period late.</li><li><strong>After 7 days from the due date:</strong> Assignments will no longer be accepted.</li></ul><p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>Assignment dropboxes close at <strong>11:55 PM EST</strong>. Any submission after this time (according to the LEARN system clock) will be considered late, even if it is only by a minute. Be aware of time zones if submitting from outside Eastern Standard Time.</li><li><strong>Accessibility Accommodations:</strong> If you are registered with Accessibility Services and require an accommodation, you must contact them <strong>before the assignment deadline.</strong> The professor will coordinate with your advisor to make appropriate arrangements. Simply missing a deadline and later mentioning registration with Accessibility Services will not be considered sufficient.</li></ul><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>This syllabus is a contract between us, so you must abide by the policies and schemes laid out here (as will I, for my part). If you have any questions or concerns, please speak with me as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Marking of Assignments and Final Exam:</strong> Marking will follow the marking rubrics posted to the LEARN site. You have 14 days (including weekends) from the time the grade appears on LEARN to appeal a grade. <i>You must first contact your tutorial TA (or the TA that marked your work) and submit a grade re-mark request form (posted on LEARN) to them and set up a time to meet with them (can also be via email)</i>. After your discussion meeting, if you would still like a re-mark, you are to email the Professor and provide them a copy of this request form, your completed marking scheme and notes from your meeting with your TA. Please note, that if the Professor grants a re-mark, the entire assignment/exam will be re-marked. It is not a valid reason to say that you believe you should have a higher grade because a friend in another tutorial section had a similar assignment and received a higher grade. Your assignment is marked as an individual effort and therefore, is unique and is marked as such. If you believe they are similar enough to receive a similar mark, then there might be issues regarding academic integrity.</p><p><strong>Academic integrity and offences</strong><br/>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility (<a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/Students/index.html"><u>http://uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/Students/index.html</u></a>). You are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offences, and to take responsibility for your actions. If you are unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or need help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration, please complete the tutorial at <a href="http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/ait"><u>http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/ait</u></a> and seek guidance from the course professor, your Undergraduate Advisor, or the office of the Associate Dean – Undergraduate.</p><p>When misconduct has been detected, disciplinary penalties will be imposed under Policy 71 – Student Discipline (<a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm"><u>http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm</u></a>).
