<p><strong>Specifications Grading</strong></p><p> </p><p>This course uses a relatively new grading method called “specifications grading” (similar to “contract grading”).  Basically, you decide what grade you want to achieve in the course and you complete a “pathway” of assessments (assignments, tutorials, in-class activities, quizzes, etc.) to achieve that grade. Your grade is primarily determined by the number and level of thinking for assessment that you complete (levels map pedagogically onto <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/teaching-resources/teaching-tips/planning-courses-and-assignments/blooms-taxonomy">Bloom’s Taxonomy</a>). You can read an overview of specifications grading <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2016/01/19/new-ways-grade-more-effectively-essay">here</a> or read the book by Linda B. Nilson. We are actually using a hybrid specs grading model, since tutorials, exams, and time management are graded using a traditional numeric system.<br/><br/>The rationale for specifications is five-fold: </p><p> </p><ol><li>It better aligns assessments with learning outcomes. Your final grade has more meaning because it is not simply an average of things you did well or not, but rather reflects the number and level of learning outcomes or competencies achieved for the course.</li><li>It increases students’ agency in determining their grades through the creation of clear pathways. This reduces students’ stress and anxiety over grades, increases motivation, and orients students’ attention toward learning (rather than performance). </li><li>Clear criteria (specifications) for different grades reduces the stress and anxiety of instructors by reducing the amount of “negotiation” and “hairsplitting” with students over marks;</li><li>Instructors allocate more time towards formative (on-going, constructive) feedback, focusing more on improving student learning rather than summative assessment;</li><li>Allowing students to resubmit without penalty encourages risk-taking, creativity and “outside of the box” thinking. This is especially important for creative work, but also for any kind of innovation.</li></ol><p> </p><p>As mentioned, the final exam, tutorial participation grade, and time management grades will be marked more conventionally (see below). All other assessments are graded pass/fail.  <strong>Importantly, a “pass” for an assessment is NOT simply a 50%.  </strong>With specifications grading a pass means that you are <strong>competent</strong> in the learning objective/outcome (or “competency”) being assessed. This is a much higher bar than simply passing. You can think of competency as the top one or two tiers of a traditional grading rubric, or the equivalent to a B or even a low A. <strong>You are given a final numeric grade according to the number (level) of learning outcomes for which you demonstrate competency.</strong> Since your assessments more closely align with specific learning outcome/objectives achieving one outcome/objective exceptionally well does not “balance” or “offset” with doing very poorly for another outcome (as is currently the case with traditional grading schemes). This is why the concept of competency is used by many bodies governing professionals. Earning a high mark in this course means that you demonstrated competency across multiple learning levels according to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/teaching-resources/teaching-tips/planning-courses-and-assignments/blooms-taxonomy">Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives</a>. By choosing a grade pathway, you are choosing the learning outcomes/objectives for which you wish to demonstrate competency and then working with the instructor to reach this goal (e.g., through revision and resubmission, if necessary). Please note that competency for the Syllabus Quiz and Academic Integrity Quiz is a grade of 100%.</p><p> </p><p>You can switch pathways, with some caveats. You can always move to a lower-level competency pathway (and do not need to contact us to do so). You can move up to a higher-level pathway before reading break so long as you are committed to catching up on missed assessments and experiential learning hours (for A pathway). Switching up pathways after the reading break is entirely at the instructor’s discretion and will require a meeting to discuss and potentially with some additional make-up work.  <strong>Switching up pathways will not be accommodated following Week 8. </strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Summary of Assessments (Organized by Chosen Grade Pathway)</strong></p><p> </p><p>This course has assessments due almost <strong>every single week </strong>in addition to classes and tutorials. Staying on top of your work is essential if you are to do well in this course.  The table below is organized to help you better see the requirements for different competency (grade) pathways. </p><p>­</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="3"><strong>Week</strong></td><td rowspan="3"><strong>Assessment</strong></td><td colspan="2" rowspan="3"><p><strong>Due Date </strong></p><p><strong>(11:59pm)</strong></p></td><td colspan="4"> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><strong>                                                           Pathway                              </strong></td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>D</strong></p><p><strong>(50-60%)</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>C</strong></p><p><strong>(60-70%)</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>B</strong></p><p><strong>(70-80%)</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>A </strong></p><p><strong>(85-100%)</strong></p></td><td> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><p>Grade floor based on specifications grading</p><p>(before time management, tutorial grade, and final exam):</p></td><td>35%</td><td>40%</td><td>50%</td><td>65%</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td><p>Time Management Agreement </p><p> </p></td><td>Jan.10</td><td>50% @ mid-term, 50% @ end-term</td><td>5%</td><td>5%</td><td>5%</td><td>10%</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>1-6,<br/>8-13</td><td>Tutorial Participation   </td><td colspan="2">Weekly Tutorial</td><td>10%</td><td>10%</td><td>10%</td><td>10%</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>TBD</td><td>Final Exam</td><td colspan="2">TBD</td><td>10%</td><td>15%</td><td>15%</td><td>15%</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>1-13</td><td>In class activities</td><td colspan="2">Random</td><td colspan="4">0.5% each (pass/fail) as redistributed weight from final exam up to 5%</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>1-13</td><td>Demonstrated Competency in Oral Communication</td><td colspan="2">n/a</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Communicating with Confidence (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/communicating-with-confidence-23450131?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A6515d26e498e5d337cba13b5&amp;u=55034593">LinkedIN Learning Certificate</a>)</td><td colspan="2">Jan.10</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Syllabus Quiz Score 100%</td><td colspan="2">Jan.10</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Zotero Bibliographies </td><td colspan="2">Jan.17</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Rhetorical Analysis (Tutorial Assignment)</td><td colspan="2">Jan.24</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td>x</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Email &amp;

There are many assignments in this course and limited weeks for the teaching assistants to give you feedback. There are posted due dates for every assignment that you should adhere to but there are no late penalties. Instead, you are given a 5% grade for time management split between your time management performance before reading break (2.5%) and in the second half of the course (2.5%). For the A Pathway this is set at 10% given the higher demands for effective time management. We will workshop together in class what an “A” entails in terms of time management. You will give yourself time management performance grades with a brief justification, although this can be adjusted by the instructor. Time management includes submitting assignments on time, but also coming to lecture and tutorials so that you can receive instructions for completing assignments properly the first time, in turn, saving time both for you and the teaching assistants assessing your work. </p><p> </p><p>Submitting your work on time allows you to receive timely feedback to improve your assignment and resubmit it in a timely fashion if necessary to demonstrate competency. A central reason why you ought to submit assignments on time is because the teaching assistants who grade most of your work are also extremely busy doing research, taking classes, juggling family responsibilities, etc. Our TAs are contracted to work 10 hours on average each week, and four hours of this are already taken up running tutorials, planning tutorials, benchmarking assignments and debriefing with the instructor. If students submit their work late (e.g., submitting everything in week 6 or at the end of the course), this would pile up the grading TAs have to complete in any one week making it unfair to them. <strong>In other words, you are part of a professional team, even when completing individual assignments. Not completing your work on time impacts the lives of other people.  </strong><br/><br/>Consequently, not submitting your work on time may also mean the TAs have little to no time to provide you with written feedback on your assignment,<strong> in turn, making it difficult for you to then make corrections to earn competency</strong> (ultimately, resulting in a double-resubmission penalty). Students who consistently submit work past the posted deadline will have to seek out resources external to the course (e.g., the Writing and Communication Centre) rather than receive written or oral feedback/assistance from the TAs or course instructor.</p><p> </p><p>Effective time management includes a realization that life will happen (sickness, death, unexpected demands on your time, etc.). To be an effective time manager also means that when something out of your control does arise, you promptly notify your team (your TA, co-curricular team, etc.) and arrange an alternative submission deadline.  Discussing with your TA is sufficient—you do not need to email the professor. Similarly, if you’re falling behind on your work, don’t wait until just before or after the due date to contact your TA—discuss with them early so you can work towards a solution. For those students with Accessibility accommodations, you should similarly notify your TA in advance if you require additional time. More serious extenuating circumstances that require a longer extension or adjustment should be discussed with your TA by appointment. You do not need to email or meet with the instructor as the TA can resolve these issues with you directly. Keep track of how you managed these situations as you will need to reference them when you discuss your time management grade.<br/><br/><strong>Note: Students who fail to submit assignments due before reading week and subsequent assignments before the end of week 11 (not including assignments due in week 12 and 13) may be asked to meet with your TA/instructor to discuss the challenges you are having. In this case, the TA/instructor will determine your time management grade, which could be set to 0% (for the first and/or second time management performance grade respectively).</strong> <br/><br/>Note: There will be no accommodations or adjustments made for missed in-class activities regardless of the reason you missed class; the grade weighting will just shift towards the final exam automatically at the end of the semester. There is no need to email or notify the TA/instructor about a missed in-class activity; although effective time management means that you should discuss with your TA if you are having to miss multiple classes.<br/> <br/><strong>Demonstrated Competency in Oral Communication</strong> </p><p> </p><p>By the end of the course, you must have demonstrated competency in oral communication. This is a requirement to pass ENVS131. Competency will be determined by the instructor and TAs through your participation in tutorial, in lecture, during office hours, and through co-curricular activities. For most students, you will not need to do any extra assignments or activities; however, the instructor can ask you to complete additional activities/programs/micro-courses to practice and to demonstrate your oral communication skills.<br/><br/> </p><p>Students who already know that they struggle with oral communication or oral communication in English should register to take part in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/renison-student-experience/conversation-partner-program">Renison Conversation Partnership Program</a>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Resubmissions </strong></p><p> </p><p>All specifications grading assignments that fail to demonstrate competency can be resubmitted. This does not include the final exam nor in-class activities. If your assignment/quiz does not pass according to the threshold set for that particular assessment you will be given one chance to resubmit that assessment without penalty. Closely re-read the original instructions as well as the feedback comments and directions from the TA before resubmitting your work. Ask your TA for a meeting if you are unclear about what you still need to do to reach competency. <br/><br/>You have five calendar days (including weekend days) to re-submit your assessment starting from the day you receive you TA’s feedback requesting a resubmission (e.g., if you receive feedback on a Sunday at 11pm then you have until Friday at 11pm to resubmit). If you fail to meet the competency threshold again then you will have to meet with the TA or instructor before attempting to redo that assessment a third time and you will incur a <strong>double-resubmission penalty of -3% from your <u>overall</u> final course grade</strong>. Having to resubmit again would result in a -10% deduction from your overall final grade. <br/><br/>Please ask the TA or come to the instructor’s office hours if you have any questions about the assignment instructors <i>before you submit</i>. If you are confused, it actually saves everyone time for you to ask in advance of submitting your assignment. Our goal is to help you reach competency for the assignment.<br/><br/><br/> </p>

In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Research Ethics:</strong> The University of Waterloo requires all research conducted by its students, staff, and faculty which involves humans as participants to undergo prior ethics review and clearance through the Director, Office of Human Research and Animal Care (Office).

The Guidelines inform researchers about ethical issues and procedures which are of concern when conducting research with humans (e.g. confidentiality, risks and benefits, informed consent process, etc.). If the development of your research proposal consists of research that involves humans as participants, the please contact the course instructor for guidance and see: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics</u></a></p>
