<p><strong>For Assignment and/or Test due dates/times, consult the LEARN site Dropbox. </strong>This reduces any conflicting information between the Dropbox and the Outline. Focus on this: If you make your own notes synthesizing course lessons every week and consult the instructions and expectations for applying course lessons to assignments and/or tests from the <u>very start of term</u>, your life will be much easier and you will be much more successful in this course and in life in general. There are PRACTICE and/or guiding examples of assignments and/or tests in the LEARN folders at the very top of the Contents.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What is the purpose of learning and assessment in the courses I teach? </strong>This seems like a silly question but it is not. We all spend about 15 years sprinting from task to task without thinking about what we are learning and why. Hence, I am putting this text in every course I teach to ensure you think about it all. My job is to teach you almost every major skill and theme that exists within a course’s scope and domain. My job is to assess if you’ve made the progress expected as a scholar and a professional. My job is to avoid cornering you on trivial details or compressing your experience into a series of soon-to-be-forgotten nightmares of memorizing factoids or math equations. I want you to know what professionals use to understand the world around us, the specific skills needed in a domain of knowledge and work, how to choose the right analytical tools, when to use the right analytical tools and how to use those analytical tools to solve difficult and important problems. I want you to be able to write professionally, regardless of whatever a course uses as its vehicles (e.g. test, assignment, project). I want you to be able efficiently find, and effectively use and critique peer reviewed literature (academic journals and professional venues) and apply it to new problems to solve. In short, I want you learn as much as there is to learn at your current stage of scholarly and professional development.</p><p>*</p><p><strong>Details on the Mid-Course Take-Home Test and Protected Areas Design Project (completed during the exam period)</strong></p><p><br/><strong>How I will evaluate your work, your progress, and calculate your final grade in ENVS 444.</strong></p><p>There are two TASKS upon which you are evaluated. A mid-course take-home test and a design project, finalized during the exam period. For both tasks, I suggest you continually and cumulatively draft some ideas based on each week’s lessons. For those who have taken other courses that I have taught, I tend to use reasonably consistent text in describing the tasks, best practices, and grading rubrics so don’t be surprised if you see similar wording between those courses.<br/> </p><p><strong>The Mid-Course Take-Home Test Process</strong></p><p><strong>Specific questions will appear when I release the test, of course</strong></p><p><strong>Weight = 50% of final grade </strong></p><p>This test will be <u>take-home (open-book)</u> and will evaluate whether you have kept pace with the course up until winter study week and can synthesize the ideas, techniques, and strategies discussed – I don’t focus on memorization of readings or slides or trivia in tests. The topics will be explicitly related directly to the course materials. The test is of modest length, i.e. designed to require no more than 100 minutes. This is less than the normal 160 minutes allocated for the two classes we eschew to give you time to complete these. This time allocation does assume you have kept current with the class lessons. <strong>Reminder: Due date and time is shown on the Dropbox folder on LEARN.</strong></p><p>Grading rubric </p><ol><li>10% is allocated to your ability to focus on the most important issues related the questions asked and your ability to write concisely</li><li>10% is allocated to your style and professionalism; this partly reflects how well you can write under some pressures of time</li><li>80% is allocated to the depth, quality and knowledge of details in your response to the questions.  <br/> </li></ol><p>For example, do you simply parrot factoids in your answers? If so, that won’t earn you very many marks. Do you briefly summarize some salient points from class lessons and source materials but wisely spend most of your time and space synthesizing and/or analyzing the issues raised in classes and by the question?  Then you will earn some excellent grades. <br/><br/>What I am always asking you to do is show me how well you understand the issues, the challenges and the solutions. In some cases, the question may ask specifically for an incisive synthesis. In many questions, I ask that you weave a brief synthesis combined with your critique of the issues raised – I want to read a sophisticated reflection and solution set from you that shows me you’ve thought carefully about the topics and issues raised in the classes and, ideally, things you can discuss that go beyond the boundaries of what the classes discussed. I want to read what you think, based on evidence or critiques of gaps in the evidence.</p><p>A useful model for how people complete this sort of task is the example of how Acreman et al. (2023) wrote their review and synthesis.  Now, you won’t be able to explore the questions as in-depth as their research team because they had lots of funding and several years to complete the task. I certainly don’t expect you to review thousands of other papers and ideas – you can stick to the sources and course materials – and I don’t expect the sort of technical method that Acreman et al (2019) used would be applied by you to your mid-course take-home test.  But you can use that paper as a model for the tone and sophistication we strive for – in their case, they wanted to know if protected areas really are all that effective in doing what we designed them for – protecting biodiversity. They critiqued the discussions in earlier peer reviewed literature, identified specific gaps, identified and analyzed what constitutes good evidence, and made some specific recommendations. That is the sort of thing you want to achieve and what I want to read. The expectation for your work is set at a third year level, of course; you are not held to peer reviewed journal standards for a mid-term test in ENVS 444. That would be silly and unfair.</p><p>What about all the fine details on analytical methods (statistics, math)? Do you get tested to death about those intense elements in ENVS 444?<i> </i> Nope. Learning is not supposed to be annealed solely to you spewing back stuff on a task, like a sick parrot. While the test and case analysis tasks you complete for your course grade are reflective of the class material and fair extensions of what we emphasized, I don't test obscure and arcane things like, for example, the formula for a Monte Carlo test. I may present these in class so we learn how and why they work and why they are good approaches. </p><p>Not everything in a class lesson need be committed to memory nor repeated on a task. Learning is about exploring new ideas, understanding (not parroting) how to do things, learning new skills, overcoming fear of the unfamiliar, and becoming aware of all the possibilities and how they might work. This is not a course where I do something stupid like ask you to walk me through the steps of creating a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). If this were a stats course, maybe. But we want to learn how to use these weird sounding things with strange abbreviations as tools to make rewilding and restoration successful. </p><p>I want to show you how and why we use them. For an analogy: I don't want to teach you how to manufacture a Phillips screwdriver; I want to show you when you should use it, why you should use it, how you use it properly, and what options there are to assess whether it was the best too.  If you use Excel, for example, you only care about how to program the base spreadsheet code if you work for Microsoft; if you use Excel in your work, you care about what it can be used for.</p><p>The rest of the term will allow you to focus on the other evaluative task – the Design Project that is due during the exam period.  </p><p> </p><p><strong>Protected Areas Design Project Instructions </strong></p><p><strong>This is completed and submitted during the exam period; you can and should start it well ahead of the end of term.</strong></p><p><strong>Weight = 50% of final grade. </strong></p><p>Using the conceptual frameworks theoretical frameworks, methodological frameworks, technical approaches, and overall ideas covered in the entire course, choose a location -anywhere in the world - for a protected area that either needs to be created or an existing one that needs to be improved. Design and plan a strategic, technical and operational approach that can lead to a successful implementation of the protected area. <u>Hereafter, I usually will just call this task the "Design Project"</u>.</p><p>I am looking for your insight into the strategic, technical (specific techniques) and operational approaches that would be needed to address this challenge - and these will largely be based on your use and synthesis of peer reviewed literature. You are aiming to convince me that either the challenge you chose or the location you choose are worthy, how you plan to address the design, what information you have vs. what information you need – and how to get it, and what kinds of theoretical and methodological frameworks and techniques might be useful. </p><p>Almost all of what you need to use is found within the materials and lessons in the course; you may choose to use new and reliable external sources to describe the overall context for your design project's location or maybe there is a good technique you want to use but we did not cover in the course. ONLY in those cases would you need to cite any literature or sources. If you use materials from ENVS 444, you DO NOT need to cite sources because I will assume that is the origin of your ideas.</p><p>The project need not be ridiculously long – conciseness, pithiness and focus are all important. As such, I would aim for your project to be no more than 8 single spaced pages in something like 12-point Calibri font. This is about 4000 words, which is about the length of a typical scoping outline for a real protected area and/or a technical/practical paper published in a peer reviewed journal.  If you use literature from outside the course, you are welcome to add more words for citations of peer reviewed or other high-quality literature (a Literature Cited section).  You don't have to use literature from outside of the course, however.</p><p>If you do choose to include any originally produced figures, they don’t count in terms of page limits. Please be aware you <u>cannot</u> copy and paste figures from other copyrighted sources without their explicit permission; you can use anything that is ‘fair use’ (things like inserting a link to an image) or explicitly allows use via a Commons license as long as you credit the source or creator.</p><p>To give you some idea of what a design project entails, you should read ahead – look at the materials in this course. <u>I provide an example on LEARN to break down a Design Project in a few steps</u>. </p><p>When choosing a location, you will need to determine if there are likely to be major barriers to stakeholder support – is the potential protected area in conflict with cultural values, is it on First Nations landholdings, is it owned by private interests or does it cross jurisdictional boundaries? You need to then connect all of this to what follows – the fact that something may be a seemingly intractable challenge does not mean you have to find another location necessarily; it means you need to be realistic about the challenges and what solutions or processes might help meet those challenges.<br/> </p><p><i>Outline of expectations and core elements for the Design Project</i></p><p>This project is to test your ability to synthesize information, decide on a conceptual framework (e.g., what is the protected area meant to focus upon in terms of goals?), and a theoretical framework (e.g., will it be embedded in population ecology theories or is it more about landscape ecology theories; is it more about people and parks, hence socioecological theory?). Is it about Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures (OECMs)? Is it about complementarity and connectedness? Is it about the tension between resource/human use and protecting biodiversity? Is it about some or all of these? You are welcome to outline that many of these would be important and briefly synthesize why but you may want to quickly narrow your focus and justify your choice, e.g. maybe you think coping with climate change and impacts on biodiversity is the best focus for your project.</p><p>You need to anticipate and discuss how you think governance, best management practices, and evaluating effectiveness will be done. </p><p>To put all that into practice, you have to decide on methodological frameworks and method that matches your conceptual and theoretical frameworks. You might be showing how different methods discussed in the course could be used, e.g. counterfactual analysis, use of drones, use of different statistical models. Related, you will need a monitoring framework to allow you to eventually test the effectiveness of the protected area (can it work to achieve your goals)?  All of these will involve monitoring &amp; indicators and some choices made amongst the analyses we discuss.</p><p>This might seem endless, but the point is to write your rough ideas down as they come to you and “freewrite” (i.e., worry less about structure and more about getting ideas down in draft form – I call it ‘vomiting on the page and cleaning the mess up later’). You can shape the argument and improve the writing style as you finish further drafts.</p><p>This is a challenge but, mainly, it is an opportunity for you to seize the day and commit to creating something great. It is your opportunity to show me how creative you can be, while paying attention to reality and the details above. Does this seem impossible or even silly? It should not. Most protected areas started off as being ‘impossible’. And now they exist. Your predecessors in this course and programs have met this challenge. </p><p>Naturally, you can discuss any problems you encounter with me or pitch ideas with me to get started. They should be your ideas, but I can help shape and focus them.</p><p><strong>Again, start with small steps and draft this project well ahead of the exam period.</strong> The example on LEARN shows you how. You can choose your location and do the assessment of barriers in the first month – and seek relevant literature for your specific approach. After that, you can develop the rest of this as the lessons unfold and by early March, you will have sufficient knowledge to draft much more of the Project Design, working on it through until the due date and time.</p><p><i>An example of an outline of a project design (this actually happened during my early career)</i></p><p>I started out working on a couple of supposedly impossible dreams of protected areas; with a <u>lot of others</u> who had the same dream, those dreams became the reality of protected areas that now exist today.</p><ul><li>Location: Rouge Valley, Toronto-Pickering boundary area</li><li>Objective: Create a unique urban national park that improves urban ecology/biodiversity</li><li>Conceptual framework: an urban national park will need to follow a novel set of rules vs. the typical national park set in rural or wild areas.</li><li>Theoretical frameworks: urban ecology, landscape connectivity and corridors, metapopulation theory, socioecological theories relevant to stakeholder negotiations, environmental and park policy theory (conflicts and opportunities with national, provincial, and municipal regulations)</li><li>Barriers: there is no policy or legal framework for urban parks, the mandate of Parks Canada will conflict with the realities of urban parks, there will be political conflicts, stakeholders and landholders may object, there is an airport planned for Pickering, there are highways planned for the area, there are developments for housing/commercial lands that may already be fixed, there will be ecological challenges to ensure wildlife can move effectively, there will be encroachment, funding</li><li>Methods: negotiation method frameworks, policy development methods, ecological monitoring foci need to be explicated, ecological restoration is needed, conservation methods (spatially explicit) and landscape ecology methods (ditto) need to be established</li><li>Communication strategy will need to focus on listening to stakeholders, having 3-5 very clear goals, a clear timeline for action, and some renderings that show the grandeur of scale and human-scale encounters that are possible with an urban national park; place emphasis on the innovation and first-in outcomes; need to get current people (who span the political spectrum) to talk up the project with political staff and politicians; need to ensure the diversity of cultures is front and center, and culturally sensitive approaches are used; this land likely is still under dispute and First Nations consultations will require time and respect, especially if no one on the current group has close contacts with members of FN</li></ul><p>You can use the above as another quick model for your own project design, tweaking it as needed to suit your circumstances.  You may recognize that this actually became Rouge National Urban Park, so the process succeeded.  It took about 20 years of work but started with the above and then moved to what you’re doing – the first design. This design project is a very real one if you take it seriously. I was part of the above and actually did a small piece for one of my courses that was part of the first design (it exists today in the form of some of the restoration ecology work being done there). Don’t view this as a purely hypothetical exercise; it can be as real and successful as you want it to be. <strong>Reminder: Due date and time is shown on the Dropbox folder on LEARN.</strong></p><p><br/><strong>Grading rubric</strong></p><ol><li>10% is allocated to your ability to focus on the most important issues and write concisely</li><li>10% is allocated to your style and professionalism; how well do you write under some pressures of time</li><li>70% is allocated to the depth, quality and knowledge of details covered in your conceptual framework, theoretical framework, and action plan that covers almost everything else (e.g. methodological framework, methods, monitoring program, communications)</li><li>10% is allocated to the feasibility, quality and ability to link to evidence provided in the key recommendations in your action plan; I realize that the distinction between items 3 and 4 is a bit blurred, hence I am looking for a detailed, workable, evidence-based, well-researched design and plan.</li></ol><p> </p><p><strong>How do I assess quality in grading your tasks?</strong></p><p>“Life is all essays; it is not multiple-choice; life is nuance, sophistication, thoughtfulness, and clarity that intersect with evidence and analysis”</p><p>Tests, case responses, and any student assessment task tries to gauge your ability to provide insight into the issues in the course, starting (but not ending) with the source material (readings/lessons). You are meant to reflect, critique, think, articulate your ideas, and propose workable approaches at a level commensurate with an upper year course. I do not expect PhD level answers to attain a great grade and you are not expected to match the level of the authors of our readings in the sense that they all have at least 10 years more experience and years to do research and write. I’m looking for you to convince me you have thought about the ideas in class so far – and we’re only a few weeks along in the course – and want to see how you handle the lessons and offer insight. It is open-ended but so is life and your insight built upon a body of knowledge is what makes you able to graduate and get paid. You’re not making widgets or parroting others; you build your ideas from a body of work and articulate them, showing us what you have to offer.  The assessment below reflects this.</p><ul><li><strong>80-100 (A): </strong>Your work addresses the fundamental issues related to the questions and provides a useful and concise synthesis of them. The upper end of this range means that you have taken reasonably intense efforts at going beyond the materials provided, insights covered in class, or the literature assigned. Your answer provides depth to convince the reader that you have great insight into the issues or the technical knowledge to produce an operational solution, reflection, synthesis and/or analysis (some or all of these may be relevant depending on the focus and scope of the questions). Relevant to most situations, it means you have used the comparative peer reviewed literature properly.  On tests, this means drawing on the insights from class lessons where we used peer reviewed literature to provide evidence to support our discussions.<br/><br/>On novel tasks/questions within tests or, more commonly, on assignments, you have sought a good body of comparative peer reviewed literature and applied it. Depending on the nature of an assignment, the peer reviewed literature can provide a conceptual and theoretical framework in an introduction, used to devise a strong set of methods, and/or used to provide insight and likely explanations for why we found certain results in experimental studies or why we should use those ideas in exercises like planning protected areas or new approaches to some socioecological endeavour (e.g. analysis of resource use, planning protected areas, devising new ways to implement ecological restoration). The specific applications vary depending on the subject material and tasks in each course you take. <br/><br/>The important thing to focus upon is that in order to be comparative and useful, peer reviewed literature does NOT necessarily have to be anchored in the same geographical location or exact same type of ecological, social, or socioecological system that you are working within. Now this does depend on what you want to use it for but generally as long as there are sufficient similarities in the types of questions being addressed, the geographic location is less important. Again, this can vary. If your topic is very narrow and depends on a unique set of ecological and social conditions, then the comparative literature has to be used carefully and account for different situations. For example, designing a protected area to conserve a population of mosses in northern Quebec will be different than designing a protected area to promote habitat connectivity and movement of elephants in South Africa. There would be relevant literature that applies to both, e.g. how do we generally work with stakeholders, but the specific ecological mechanisms would differ. <br/><br/>See any peer reviewed research study to see how they use peer reviewed literature in the Introduction and Discussion sections or, for assignments/tests not structured this way, how any peer reviewed paper uses peer literature overall.<br/> </li><li><strong>70-79 (B):</strong><i> </i>Your work shows that you have most of the elements and knowledge related to answering the questions. On the lower end of this range, the text and answer itself is a bit muddled or disorganized; on the upper end of this range, this is less of an issue. Answers receiving the lower end of this grade range normally are ones that reflect a more superficial understanding of the issues related to the answer or are not as well written. Usually, this grade range reflects a good understanding of the ideas but not as much insight as would be found in an A level grade. Typically, those who earn in the B range are better at <i>synthesis</i> of ideas than at <i>analysis</i> and applying what we learn in class to solving specific problems.<br/> </li><li><strong>60-69 (C): </strong>You generally addressed the main requirements of the questions, but your answer shows less than rudimentary mastery of the basic materials and no real cohesion in your answer. Where relevant, it often indicates no serious engagement with the peer reviewed literature in any detail, i.e. you are normally expected to offer a synthesis of salient points and critique and explicate things like relevant social and/or ecological mechanisms that offer insight into our problem at hand.  It usually reflects some rather poor sentence structure, grammar, spelling, and/or organization.<br/> </li><li><strong>50-59 (D):</strong> Within this range, you provide enough insight to pass but not much more than that.  The upper end shows more effort and more promise, e.g. it might lack serious analysis but be written reasonably well<br/> </li><li><strong>Below 50 (F):</strong><i> </i>There is no sign of a serious effort to grapple with the questions. Usually this reflects some problem unrelated to the actual course material, so we work together to determine how to correct the deeper issues without intruding personally.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>What are the page limits/word count limits for the tasks?</strong><i>  </i></p><p>These are the bane of my existence because they put people into the mindset of 'bean counting' rather than focusing on saying something useful and accurate (which is the whole point of writing), but I appreciate why students want them (and professionally, word limits do exist).  Again, the whole point of assessment is gauging the quality of your understanding and ability to answer questions. It is not about word limits.  So, any word or page limit I set in this course represent a decent set of <u>guidelines</u>  (<u>not strict rules</u>) as to how long your answer likely you should be, but it depends on your writing style - some people are very concise.  </p><p>Typically, a single page Word document wherein you use single spacing and a 12 pt font like Tahoma or Calibri represents about 500 words.  So if it is a 4000 word 'limit', then that is about 8 pages. Why single-spaced? Because it is no longer the year 1972 (when students used to double space because typewriters or handwritten documents needed to leave room for comments; nowadays, we have this marvellous thing called a "Word Processor" which magically allow us to submit e-documents rather than printing them and have marginal comment boxes).  </p><p>If you are obsessed with word counts in this course, you're focused on precisely the wrong thing and are not going to do a good job.  What I want you to focus on is to give me a good quality, intelligent, well evidenced, pragmatic, theoretically sound output. And, sure, the word limits do help you make sensible decisions, e.g. if it is 4000 words, then sending me a 1000 word piece is likely too shallow and poor and a 10,000 word piece is way too much and reflects excessive verbiage. <br/> </p><p><i>How do you handle all the fine details on analytical methods (e.g. statistics, math formulae)? </i> Learning is not supposed to be annealed solely to you spewing back stuff on a task, like a sick parrot. While the test and case analysis tasks you complete for your course grade are reflective of the class material and fair extensions of what we emphasized, I don't test obscure and arcane things like, for example, the formula for a Monte Carlo test. I may present these in class so we learn how and why they work and why they are good approaches. </p><p>Not everything in a class lesson need be committed to memory nor repeated on a task. Learning is about exploring new ideas, understanding (not parroting) how to do things, learning new skills, overcoming fear of the unfamiliar, and becoming aware of all the possibilities and how they might work. This is not a course where I do something stupid like ask you to walk me through the steps of creating a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). If this were a stats course, maybe. But we want to learn how to use these weird sounding things with strange abbreviations as tools to make rewilding and restoration successful. </p><p>I want to show you how and why we use them. For an analogy: I don't want to teach you how to manufacture a Phillips screwdriver; I want to show you when you should use it, why you should use it, how you use it properly, and what options there are to assess whether it was the best too.  If you use Excel, for example, you only care about how to program the base spreadsheet code if you work for Microsoft; if you use Excel in your work, you don't care about any of that - you only care what Excel can be used for and how to use it properly.</p><p>I only assume you have experience with – and can recall – how basic statistics are used in environmental analyses, e.g., as in ENVS 178 or STAT 202.  If you have successfully completed some or all of more advanced courses, you may find the material in ENVS 444 a bit tame, but it is unlikely any of those courses used the same tools for the purpose of designing protected areas/parks. </p><p>The quantitative methods and analyses (for skill building) that I focus upon in ENVS 444 are excellent complements to ERS 335 (where R is used for analyses of ecological restoration), ERS 337 (where various programs like Circuitscape are used to analyze rewilding), ERS 346 (where Python and/or R are used to analyze wildlife ecology), several of the GIS focused courses (especially in GEOG and PLAN) that teach basic to advanced spatial visualization and analysis, and courses across the University of Waterloo that focus on spatially explicit and multivariate analyses.  </p><p>Again, the point is not to try and force you to be experts in less than 12 weeks, because that cannot happen. The point is to ensure that you grasp the fundamentals, the scope, the possibilities, &amp; the opportunities that exist and how vast and interesting they can be.  </p><p> </p><p><strong>One piece of advice on writing style.</strong></p><p>Avoid rhetorical flourishes and extraneous connectives like "it must be understood that" or "Smith and Jones did a study in 2007 in Grenoble France that was really interesting".  Get to the point and save time, space, and reader sanity. The former connective is never needed; the latter sentence could be expressed better as "Smith and Jones (2007) found that..."</p><p> </p><p><strong>Submission deadlines, alternative grading paths, &amp; related policies.</strong></p><p>I tinker with this to hit the sweet spot of instilling professionalism and having compassion for students. One challenge that by this stage students are reflexively stuck on the notion of late penalties so this term I gave into that wall and put in some modest ones.  Here is this term’s set of policies for submission deadlines. I decided to try a policy that helps you if you are squeezed for time and rewards you if you meet the deadline.  </p><ul><li>Your work will be submitted online via LEARN. <strong>They are due on the date and time indicated on the Dropbox submission folders on LEARN. </strong>They will be graded and commented on using the track changes feature of MS Word, hence submit your work as a MS Word file or a format that is easily compatible - most word processing programs can save files as rich text format (.rtf). Call them surname_firstname_444X where X = 1,2, or 3. Don’t take this too literally; swap in your own name please.  Yes, people do forget to do that. It makes it hard to track whose assignment is whose. Life advice: Never add unnecessarily to workload for you or anyone else.<br/> </li><li>Any assignment or test submitted <strong>late but still within 21 days after the due date and time </strong>incurs a flat 5% reduction in the potential grade.<ul><li>That is a small penalty; it means the grade is lowered by about 1 increment (e.g. A to A-). If you are stressed or pressed for time, take the small penalty and submit when you can. The penalties do not increase any further with time.</li><li>If I had received official word from AccessAbility (they email me in confidence) about you needing alternative schemes, those will be followed (of course) and this reduction policy may not apply in this exact manner.<br/> </li></ul></li><li>Any assignment or test submitted <strong>late</strong> and <strong>more than 21 days after the due date and time</strong> incurs a flat 10% reduction in the potential grade. This includes those that are labelled as INComplete and/or are carried over into the following term until completed. This is a larger penalty designed for your to not procrastinate at submitting work that is increasingly overdue. Again, exceptions can be made under extenuating circumstances.<br/> </li><li>After about 10 working days, I have LEARN send out an email to everyone it detects as having not yet submitted. It will ask if you need help and to contact me. This gets repeated until we work out alternatives or you submit something. Again, the penalties are not being increased; I just need to make sure you are not in deep distress.<br/> </li><li>If you want your final grade to show on Quest on time at the end of the term, you have to submit all assignments by the due date and time of the final assignment in the course.  This is solely because I need time to grade, and the University requires I submit grades by a fixed date in order for them to show up on your Quest account.<br/> </li><li>If you do not submit assignments by the due date and time of the final assignment in the course, this creates potential issues – mainly relevant if and only if you plan to graduate after the end of this term.<ul><li>You should not divulge personal information to me. This is not because I do not care but because ethics and regulations protect your privacy. In communication, all I need to know is the depth to which you need help – not the details. Our communication would focus on getting the help you need.</li><li>Communication is vital. As you read the points below, make sure you commit to regular communication with me, whatever path we need to take. Do not forget this. If you do, the Registrar will have to make a decision in absence of communication from you and that often means you fail the course. We do not want that, especially if it is because you neglected to communicate with me regularly about your progress to competition or need for further help.</li><li>At the end of each term, I normally have obligations for research - this is 40% of a typical professor’s job; teaching courses is only 40% of it. While I will get all the on-time assignments done and grades submitted on time, late ones might not get done until after the Registrar’s Office deadline passes.</li><li>Anything after the due date and time risks me having to assign an INComplete.<ul><li>If a student can do all the assignments/tests but will need to spill into the next term, we normally negotiate a grade showing INComplete and establish a deadline, typically near the end of the following term.</li><li>Once submitted and graded, the INC changes into a formal numerical grade as usual.</li><li>If there are no other complications for a student (see below), this is the normal process and while it means you have an obligation to fulfill, it is a detour on the road in life.</li></ul></li><li>The issue is not that you have an INComplete – all that means is that I work with you and the Registrar to fix a deadline for later competition.  The issue is that you can’t graduate until it is done. If you are not planning to graduate after this term, it is much less of an issue.</li><li>There are some cases where an INComplete can interfere with course selection if this is a pre-requisite or if you need a full set of completed courses for a scholarship or job. These are rare but do be aware if this might affect you and work with me ahead of time to ensure we avoid problems.</li><li>DO NOT wait until the due date within the Final Exam period for the first time you contact me. I will respond but given I am also out on field research trips, I may not respond within the timeframe you need. If you work things out with me well beforehand, it makes your life easier.</li><li>If you suspect that you cannot hand in all the assignments, let us talk well in advance and come to an alternative. If you need help or some compassion, ask immediately. That's what I am here for. I know this is hard, especially asking an authority figure and/or a relative stranger. I can work out an alternative if it helps you succeed.<ul><li>Generally, if a student cannot complete all of the assignments in full, I'll rejig the course weighting for you and cap the final grade at 82% as the maximum you can earn - this represents a still creditable A-. 82% represents the historical median in most every course I ever teach.</li><li>This cap is to be fair to the others who do hand in all of the assigned tasks that I grade.</li><li>This cap is not sacrosanct because there are cases where a student is ill (e.g. COVID) or other issues, so any reweighting/rejigging is done on a personal and compassionate basis depending on your circumstances.<br/> </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>As most of you know, LEARN does have a gradebook feature that allows you to see the cumulative grade.  I caution that if we need to make accommodations to help you as a student, the gradebook won’t be the final authoritative record. For example, if life deals you a bad hand and you need me to drop a task or adjust task weights, LEARN's gradebook won't reflect that. Sometimes I will review the grading before submitting the final marks via QUEST and find you should have had a grade on an assignment that was a bit higher than originally recorded. LEARN also might slip its gears and add the grades wrong.  Basically, my job and obligation to you is to manually review everything before submitting grades to ensure you got the fairest and best possible outcome for all your hard work. The gradebook is a useful automated tool. My job as a professor and human being is to ensure the tool does not harm you. I am not of the mind that says we should automate the world. You are a person and each of you is treated as someone with rights and needs.</li></ul><p><strong>Do you want to succeed in life and in this course? Read this. Now.</strong></p><p><strong>Preparation</strong> is the key to success and creating superior performance on tests and assignments. Success is 90% perspiration via preparation and 10% inspiration.</p><ul><li>Read this Course Outline for the structure and intentions of the course, tests and assignment rationale &amp; structure, and course policies. Note that this is a boilerplate list. Not all of my courses have both tests and assignments.</li><li>Do some ‘intel’. Ask your peers how a professor conducts their class. Do they want you to memorize every last word and barf up factoids? Do they want you to synthesize, critique, and problem solve? Those are very different approaches.</li><li>Read the lesson slides ahead of time. I usually post all of them at beginning of term.</li><li>Skim the sources for each lesson ahead of time – they are challenging because they are the highest level of professional sources for analysis and knowledge. They represent the professionalism that you eventually achieve. I selected peer-reviewed readings and related resources for your use as background on the topics we will discuss in class and as sources for your assignments. LEARN has copies of all of these. Read the sources strategically, i.e. they are not a novel but rather a turnkey to help us understand theory and practice. The abstract and discussion sections of journal articles are particularly helpful.</li><li>In each source, read and make notes on the abstract at least – because it ‘abstracts’ a complex set of ideas into a clear set of lessons learned or ideas launched, if the authors did it correctly.</li><li>Attend the lessons because this is where I weave the narrative, consider the evidence, explicate how the sources achieved or failed to achieve their objectives, and critique the state of knowledge and evidence for each lesson’s topic. I construct the lessons first, check the state of peer reviewed knowledge to ensure I am congruent with that, and then selected 3-5 sources each lesson because scholarly and professional integrity demand that I support the lesson with evidence and critique.</li><li>In each lesson you attend, make explanatory notes in real time to reinforce what you are learning.</li><li>Review and expand those notes within a week of each lesson.</li><li>Anticipate how an assignment or test is structured and what it might ask. I provide sample or practice versions of tests and assignments to help familiarize you with all that.</li><li>Start assignments at the very beginning of term by simply writing down your early thoughts.</li><li>It is usually possible to make quite a lot of progress on assignments and tests even if you have not yet encountered and/or grasped all the course material. How? See the steps above plus do what is possible early and often.<ul><li>For example, if you are in a course where it asks for outside literature on an assignment, use those little bits of time between other events in your day to hop online, use Web of Science to find promising peer reviewed papers, download them (because Web of Science via U Waterloo is great at this), change the filename to something meaningful (e.g. ERS 475 assignment on sustainability analysis – this is a great method by Smith 2021), and then synthesize these in a draft of your assignment. In a few weeks, you will have built a draft that is 70% done.</li><li>NOTE: Not all of my courses ask for the type of example above; it is a good example that applies to only some courses. You can do the same sort of thing if you are in a course that is focused on tasks that solely ask for engagement with class lessons. See above steps again.<br/> </li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>How do you take notes? Especially in real-time when there’s a lot going on? </strong></p><ul><li>How people do this varies. Some like to record what I am saying. That’s fine. The only restriction is that the material and my words is copyrighted by me; you get to use it but can’t share it with anyone else. Others like to physically write on paper – old school; usually, they print 4-6 of the slides from the deck and make notes on each in real time. Still others write marginal notes on each slide of the downloaded slide deck on their laptops or tablets; don’t forget to save the edits constantly or turn on auto-save. All my slides are posted on LEARN ahead of time.</li><li>You don’t need to hang on my every word. Again, take note of what I emphasize, dissect, critique, and elaborate upon. Take note of what you find challenging or need to rethink. If I toss out some minor factoid to make a point, it won’t show up on a test or assignment because it is not that important, I don’t run my classes using that dirty trick, and the chances are that it was extemporaneous so I probably would not remember raising it even a week later.</li><li>Yes I know you probably experienced teachers or professors who are shitheads who ask a question weighted at 20% of an assignment based on one offhand 30 second remark in class. I don’t do that. The assignments and tests in my courses reflect the emphasis and weighting of what is in the course material and/or on the Instructions for each.</li><li>If you prepared ahead of time, this is easier. Seriously. See previous notes on preparation.</li><li>I DO NOT want you to memorize every last word I wrote or said or memorize shit or barf up factoids.</li><li>I want you to synthesize, critique, and problem solve.</li><li>I want you to become conversant and familiar with a range of ideas.</li><li>I want you to begin the journey to understand evidence and how we do analysis to assess that evidence.</li><li>Some of that understanding means we must dissect how some rather scary-looking math equations allow us to achieve our goals. In my courses, we DO NOT memorize equations or try and make you all pure or applied mathematicians. I want you to confront fearful things and help guide you into a good understanding that it is not so scary. Understanding is what makes things less scary.  Your note-taking should reflect my intention.<ul><li>This means that on assignments or tests, I don’t ask that you reproduce and offer mathematical proofs for any analysis methods.</li><li>But I will ask that you are able to tell me:<ul><li>what choices of analysis we have</li><li>what might work best for a given ecological or socioecological problem we need to solve</li><li>what pitfalls we have to watch for</li><li>what assumptions of analysis methods do we need to test</li><li>given all of the above, how can we apply an analysis method to solve our problem – why would it work and how would it work</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Given all of this, your notes in real-time should be elaborations reflecting how I am using the foundation of what I put on slides and then critiqued what authors said or did; I often quote them on a slide and critique this in class. I don’t expect every word I say in class to be memorized or held sacrosanct. If you are puzzled by something, make note of it. Ask in class if you wish or ask me another time if you want to think about it first.</li><li>The bottom line is that I want to ensure you leave this course having become comfortable, familiar, and in some cases mastered a body of knowledge, evidence, analytical skills in both specific technical methods and problem solving critical thinking, critical writing, sophisticated writing, writing with confidence, and a vision for your personal and professional trajectory to achieve satisfaction in both. I aim to educate and train you so on the other side of this course you can get the job and life you want.<br/> </li></ul><p><strong>Context, perspective and the awful legacy of much of what we have done in creating protected areas:</strong></p><p> “At the time of its founding in 1872, Yellowstone was not untrammeled wilderness; it was the home of several indigenous tribes that served as such effective caretakers of the land that it reportedly <i>looked</i> untrammeled, especially in comparison to nearby homesteads. Nevertheless, President Ulysses S. Grant expelled the region’s residents in order to establish the park, violating prior treaties.”</p><ul><li>Chanelle Adams <a href="https://www.thedriftmag.com/the-audacity-of-nature-docs/">https://www.thedriftmag.com/the-audacity-of-nature-docs/</a></li></ul><p> </p>

When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/ about/equity-office3 </p><p><strong>Position on use of AI in this course. </strong>While AI offers an interesting addition to the toolkit for professionals, this course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as synthesis, analysis, and professional writing. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
