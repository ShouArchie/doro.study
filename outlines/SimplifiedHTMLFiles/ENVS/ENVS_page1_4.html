<p><strong>Class Lectures and Meetings</strong></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>In-person</strong></p><p><i>Lectures</i></p></td><td>On <strong>Thursdays from 8:30am-10:20am in RCH 101</strong>, we will explore stats concepts in the textbook. Weekly lectures will be posted on LEARN and be available until the end of the course.</td></tr><tr><td><p><i><strong>In-Person  </strong></i></p><p><i>Tutorials</i></p></td><td>Tutorials will be held on <strong>Thursdays (attendance is mandatory)</strong>. Check your class schedule for your assigned tutorial time/location.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Office Hours</strong></p><p>I will hold office hours on Thursdays (10:30-12:30pm). Office hours are there for you to ask questions or discuss issues that you are experiencing in the course. The Teaching Assistants are also available and ready to help during their tutorials. <u>We are here to help.</u></p><p><strong>Learning Modes</strong></p><p>This course consists of weekly in-person lectures, weekly in-person tutorials, homework, assignments, a midterm exam and a final exam.  <strong><u>Completing these exercises is very important</u></strong> to student success. </p><p>Students are expected to: </p><ul><li><strong><u>Review both the readings and lecture materials</u></strong></li><li><strong><u>Complete all homework, assignments and quizzes by their required deadlines</u></strong></li><li><strong><u>Attend the In-Person Tutorials (Thursdays) to collaboratively practice course content</u></strong></li><li><strong><u>Attend the In-Person Classes (Thursdays) to review the course content</u></strong></li><li><strong><u>Prepare for and complete the Midterm and Final Exams</u></strong></li></ul><p>Keeping up with the readings, lecture materials and assignments is important. The lectures may seem to be too fast if you have not completed the readings ahead of time. You will also get the most out of the lectures if you attempt all recommended lecture questions and review any answers that you do not understand.</p><p>Lectures are a required component of the course. Lectures are supplementary to the readings and review software tools for this course. You will require a detailed understanding of the readings AND lecture material to do well. Examples from readings will come up in class, but it is not the purpose of lecture to summarize all aspects of the readings. It is the students’ responsibility to ensure they fully comprehend the readings, and ask questions if clarification is required. </p><p><strong>Communication, or Q&amp;A</strong></p><p>There are many ways to find answers to your questions about the course. Here are some strategies that you might try: </p><ol><li>Ask your TA during Tutorials. Tutorials are the primary channel to ask questions and work through course content.</li><li>Email one of the TAs to ask your question. Please use “ENVS 178” in the subject line.</li><li>Visit Dr. Rutty during Office Hours. </li><li>Email Dr. Rutty to ask your question. Please use “ENVS 178” in the subject line.</li></ol><p>If you would like to get in touch with either the TAs or the instructor, I highly recommend that you try to meet in-person during Tutorials or office hours. If you need to send an email to one of your TAs or to Dr. Rutty please use “ENVS 178” in the subject line. With ~300 students in the course, it may take up to 48 hours to respond to an email based on regular working hours (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm EDT/EST).</p><p><strong>Communications with Instructor and Teaching Assistants</strong></p><p>All communication with students must be through either the student’s University of Waterloo email account or via LEARN. TAs and instructors will not respond to emails sent from non-UW email accounts. </p><p><strong>Cautions</strong></p><p>The rate at which new information and concepts are presented in university may be faster than previously experienced by students. Students are expected to <strong><u>take detailed notes during lectures</u></strong>. </p><p>It is essential that students stay up-to-date, particularly with readings, definitions, and concepts. Students should:</p><p>- Complete readings and practice questions before each lecture</p><p>- Review notes after each lecture</p><p>- Practice additional questions from the Pearson Study Plan and the textbook</p><p>- Ask questions via the LEARN discussion board, tutorials, the stats country fair or during office hours if you are unsure about any of the material or feel you are falling behind. </p><p><strong>Don’t wait until the day of a deadline to ask questions</strong>.</p><p>Completing the readings and reviewing the lectures will not be sufficient to do well in this course. Students are expected to think critically about the material, ask questions, and develop the ability to synthesize knowledge from different sources (e.g., lectures, readings, discussions, etc.). </p>

<p>The professor determines the content and establishes the grading rules for all exercises, assignments, and exams. Teaching assistants will help mark these items under the supervision of the instructor. To calculate your final grade in the course, some of your lowest marks will be dropped including: your lowest mark on the weekly MyLab homework assignments, and your lowest 2 tutorial attendance marks (you can miss up to two tutorials). In addition, if you score higher on the Final Exam than on the Midterm Exam, then your Midterm Exam grade is voided and your Final Exam grade is re-weighted to account for both your Midterm and Final Exam grade (50% of your course grade). When determining a student's final grade in the course, the professor will examine the record of each individual student's achievement; the final grade may be adjusted to take into account extenuating and compassionate circumstances and the student's general pattern of achievement in the course.</p><p>If a student chooses to contest a grade in the course, please note that there is a 24 hour wait period between when the grade is posted and when a grade contestation can be made. After that 24 hour period, the student should contact the course instructor directly by email. In the email, the student should state the grade they receive, the grade that they feel they should receive, and a justification for why the grade should be changed. The course instructor will then review the case to determine whether a grade re-evalutation is warranted. If the course instructor feels a re-evaluation is warranted, the course instructor will then re-assess the student’s assignment. Please note: this re-evaluation may result in either a higher or lower grade based on the course instructor’s evaluation.</p><p><strong>Policies, Grade Penalties and Special Considerations:</strong></p><p><u>Late submissions</u>: All assignments are due at the date and time set by the instructor. Teaching assistants are NOT allowed to change the due dates or times. Due to the size of this class, <strong>late homework assignments will not be accepted.</strong></p><p><u>Computer use:</u> Assignments must be completed through MyLab Statistics and, where applicable, with Microsoft Excel. <strong>For assignments requiring the use of Excel, the assignments must be submitted to the LEARN dropbox as Excel files (not shared via a URL).</strong></p><p><u>Readability and clarity</u>: You are expected to submit work that is well organized and written in proper English. </p><p><u>Requests for exemptions or compassionate considerations:</u> Any assignment deadline extension requests due to valid absences requiring documentation must be submitted in advance or as soon as possible to <u>https://vif.uwaterloo.ca</u>, with supporting documentation for approval. Self-declared absences (for flu-like illness, short-term 48-hour self declared absences) must be submitted through Quest. <strong>Extensions or deferrals will not be granted to accommodate travel plans or other recreational activities. </strong></p><p><u>Covid Policy:</u><strong> </strong>Students who must miss class due to Covid-19 or other illness must enter absences into the system. Students can self-declare one Covid absence of up to 10 days and one absence for any reason for up to 2 days per term. For <i><strong>illness/medically-related absences other than Covid-19</strong></i>, please have a medical provider complete the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness (VIF) form</a> and submit it to <a href="https://absence.uwaterloo.ca/">https://absence.uwaterloo.ca</a>.  Further absences require documentation, which students enter via <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">vif.uwaterloo.ca</a>. Absences will be accommodated according to the<a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations"> academic regulations section of the undergraduate calendar</a> for all courses (graduate and undergraduate) in Environment.</p><p>In the event of instructor illness, classes will be temporarily suspended and in-person classes may be temporarily moved online, depending on the severity of instructor illness and self-isolation requirements. Should the University of Waterloo require the suspension of in-person instructional activity, all classes, tests and exams will be conducted online.</p><p><strong>Unclaimed assignments</strong></p><p>Unclaimed paper assignments are normally retained for at least one month after term grades become official in Quest. After that time, they will be destroyed in compliance with UW’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/records-management/records-disposal-and-destruction">confidential shredding procedures</a>.</p><p><strong>Professionalism and Attendance</strong></p><p>In the Faculty of Environment and at the University of Waterloo, you are expected to communicate with your instructors, staff and fellow students in a mutually respectful and professional manner. Use formal salutations in emails and personal interaction. All communication with students must be through either the student’s University of Waterloo email account or via Learn. If a student emails the instructor or TA from a personal account they will be requested to resend the email using their personal University of Waterloo email account. During office hours, tutorials, and lecture, please ensure that you are not distracting other students. You are expected to pay attention and participate in an appropriate manner. To obtain full marks, students need to complete all homework exercises, be actively engaged in the course materials, and act in a professional manner as defined above.</p><p><strong>Midterm Examination</strong></p><p><strong>A midterm exam will be held in class on Thursday, February 13th, 2024</strong>. The exam will be the entire length of the class. Students arriving late will not be provided with additional time to complete the exam. At the exam, students are allowed to use standalone handheld calculators without connectivity technology such as wifi, bluetooth, etc. <strong>The use of calculators on phones or other digital devices with connectivity technology is not permitted</strong>. All other items must be left at the back or front of the room. The midterm exam covers all material covered in class at that point and the readings. </p><p><strong>Final Examination</strong></p><p>There is a compulsory final examination in this course. You are required to be present to write the examination. As in the midterm exam, students are allowed to use standalone handheld calculators without connectivity technology such as wifi, bluetooth, etc. <strong>The use of calculators on phones or other digital devices with connectivity technology is not permitted</strong>.<strong> </strong>The examination is scheduled by the registrar and is within the University’s normal examination period. You should not make travel arrangements until they have consulted the final examination time table. The University examination schedule is published by the Registrar during the Fall term. The final exam covers <u>all material</u> from the course. If you receive a higher grade on the final exam than on the midterm then your final exam grade will count toward 50% of your final course grade (and the midterm grade becomes void).</p><p><strong>Homework Exercises and Assignments</strong></p><p>To help you prepare for the midterm and final exam, regular homework assignments are part of this class. Further details regarding assignments will be distributed in class. Pearson MyLab access is required to complete some of the assignments, as is a recent version of Microsoft Excel. Homework is open-book and open-note. <strong>Students are expected to complete homework assignments on their own</strong>. It is natural to discuss challenges encountered with the textbook material with peers, however, students should not collaborate on the MyLab homework or Excel Assignments. Please note that <strong>TAs and the instructor are <u>required</u> to report any <u>suspected</u> violation of academic integrity</strong>. This includes suspicion that a student submitted work that does not accurately reflect their level of mastery. The University of Waterloo takes its culture of integrity seriously because it prepares you for the professional world. Students are also encouraged to seek guidance from their TAs and/or instructor if they encounter difficulties with homework assignments. </p><p><strong>Generative AI and Online Homework Help Platforms are Not Allowed in This Course</strong></p><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills when completing the weekly MyLab assignments, as well as three course assignments, which requires only the textbook, the online course lecture materials, Microsoft Excel, an offline calculator, and the online MyLab tools provided by Pearson. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee</u></a>.</p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p>Students are expected to complete the ENVS 178 homework assignments without the use of content generation tools (like ChatGPT or similar tools that generate text, code or graphics) and without the use of online homework help platforms (like Chegg, Photomath, etc.). Using these tools and platforms to create and submit content as one's own work in the ENVS 178 course homework and assignments<strong> is a violation of the </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">University of Waterloo’s Policy 71 (Student Discipline).</a> When completing the ENVS 178 MyLab homework assignments, students may only use their textbook, the online course lecture materials, Microsoft Excel, an offline calculator, and the online MyLab tools provided by Pearson.</p>

The following text is recommended:<br/><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/ about/equity-office3 </p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
