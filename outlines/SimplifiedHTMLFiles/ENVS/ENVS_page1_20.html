<div>ENVS 410:</div>
<p>Methods for future studies are reviewed. Students will then produce a research or design project focused on an urban futures theme.</p>

<p>In this course you will review and apply futures thinking methods and frameworks through a research/design project on an urban futures theme. The course begins by reviewing key concepts, methods, and frameworks in futures thinking. We then move towards designing and developing an interdisciplinary team-based approach to intervening in current urban future trajectories, to explore alternative urban futures. The course culminates in a presentation and reflection on how futures thinking can help intervene in the spatial, representational, material, and/or relational dimensions of producing alternative urban futures. The course should be of particular relevance to students interested in planning, policy, governance, activism, and research through interdisciplinary team-based approaches.  </p>

<p> </p><p><strong>Class Project (50%)</strong></p><p>The class project is to be completed in small groups focused on a place and a theme, which you will explore through three moments in time – now (the present), before (the past), and after (the future). The point is to understand a current issue both by seeing how it came into being and by making an intervention in the present that will change the future. The project should reveal key aspects of the history of the place/theme, going back generations, describing major changes in the environment, the social relations, technologies, and the interactions across different systems, to help explain why the theme/place looks the way it does today. At the same time, the project needs to propose and justify an intervention in present-day conditions that aims to change what this place/theme will look like 80 years from now, developing a rationale, argument, and intentional use of futures thinking methods and frameworks. Groups of students will work together in sharing and integrating their findings, unpacking dominant assumptions, to develop a methodical inquiry process for guiding their intervention strategy, which they will present at the end of the course. The project will be graded on the following elements:</p><ul><li>Group process guidelines (5pts)</li><li>Group plan for using futures methods and frameworks (5pts)</li><li>Group sharing, evaluation, and integration work 1 (12.5pts)</li><li>Group sharing, evaluation, and integration work 2 (12.5pts)</li><li>Presentation (15pts)</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>LEARN Discussion Posts &amp; Comments</strong><i><strong> </strong></i><strong>(15%)</strong></p><p>Each week for weeks 1-3 you will post a short (~400 words max) reflection responding to a weekly prompt designed to support your learning and work in the class. Reflections are due on Thursdays by 10pm posted on LEARN (see Connect  Discussion tab).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Reflection Essay</strong><i><strong> </strong></i><strong>(15%)</strong></p><p>Write a reflection essay (2000 to 3000 words) that connects the course learning objectives with your aspirations to change urban futures: what have you learned about futures thinking methods and frameworks that you will carry forward into future projects/work? Your essay should reference key themes from class discussions, LEARN discussion threads, while also drawing on elements of the Class Project, to develop an argument about the challenges and opportunities for applying futures thinking in shaping urban futures in collective ways. Your essay will be evaluated based on the argument (the extent to which you make and develop a precise claim), the evidence (how you support your claim with convincing examples that demonstrate an understanding of futures thinking methods and frameworks), and writing quality (essay form, grammar, spelling, flow).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Course Participation</strong><i><strong> </strong></i><strong>(20%)</strong></p><p>You will have two opportunities to evaluate your own participation in the course using a rubric provided. The first evaluation will be focused just on you, while the second will also include an opportunity to evaluate peers in your small groups. Your score will be based on attendance, engagement with your peers during class, and preparation/work you conduct outside of class. </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
