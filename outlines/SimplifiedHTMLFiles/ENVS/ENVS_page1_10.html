  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ENVS 205:</div>
<p>This course introduces students to the goals, principles, and practices of sustainability. Sustainability thinking, policies, and programs aim to increase and maintain human well-being by integrating or reconciling current social and economic goals (e.g., economic growth; poverty alleviation; gender inequality) with long-term environmental objectives (e.g., improved environmental quality; climate stability; biodiversity conservation; and managing resources to ensure future access). Case studies are used to illustrate solutions for realizing sustainability, emphasizing efforts underway for reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The course assesses four intersecting and sometimes competing approaches for realizing sustainability: technological innovation; market-based approaches; state regulation and investment; and individual and collective ("grassroots") action. Key values underlying sustainability are explored, including notions of the "good life", democracy, social justice, and efficiency.</p>

<h3>Course Features</h3><p>There are 14 modules in this course, however, students are only required to complete 12 modules. Students must complete the required modules, modules 1 through 8 and module 12 (and the associated assessments), and can choose to complete any of the three optional modules (and associated assessments), modules 9, 10, or 11. </p><p>The course is designed to get you thinking about and applying key concepts in the course. Throughout the course you will find <strong>Apply Your Learning</strong> boxes, where you have the opportunity to test your understanding and engage with important concepts. Answering these questions will help you prepare you for the quizzes.</p><p>Each module contains text, visuals, video content as well as required reading. The modules also include applied <strong>Examples</strong>, that help to demonstrate concepts and <strong>Definition</strong> boxes, that help clarify words that all students may not be familiar with.</p><p>Many of the modules include <strong>Learning Activities</strong>, some of which are <i><strong>graded</strong></i> and some are <i><strong>ungraded </strong></i>(although both are required and contain concepts tested in the quiz). There are also Learning Activities you can submit for bonus marks (are not required or tested on the quizzes). In most modules, the readings and videos are integrated within the modules (e.g., read a couple module pages, do the required text reading and then return to the module pages). The order matters, so doing all the readings before or after the module is not the best approach.</p><p>In addition to these core resources, you'll find lots of <strong>Optional Resources</strong> in the course. These are clearly labeled on the module pages and listed on the module landing page. These are here for you to deepen your understanding or learn more about a concept you may be particularly interested in and are not required.</p><h3>Assessments</h3><p>Your learning will be assessed through <strong>End of Module Quizzes</strong>, several<strong> Learning Activities</strong> and a few written <strong>Assignments</strong>, providing the opportunity to apply concepts learned in the course. The final exam will be a take-home <strong>Final Assignment</strong>. See the <strong>Activities and Assignments</strong> pages and <strong>Student Assessment</strong> section for more details.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
</p>
<div>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h2>Course Policies</h2><h3>Late Penalty</h3><p>The late penalty on Assignments will be a deduction of 10% for the first day late and then 25% for each additional calendar day (including weekends) the Assignment is submitted beyond the Grace Period (see below). E.g., if an assignment is graded out of 20 marks and you submit at &gt;11:59pm (e.g., 12:00am, 1am or 4am, etc.) after the Grace Period, this will be a deduction of 2 marks (i.e., -10%); if you submit two days late, then this will be a deduction of 7 marks out of 20 (i.e., -10% - 25% = - 35%).</p><p>The Grace Period (see below) applies to End of Module Quizzes. Graded Learning Activities as well as Assignments; however, <strong>the late penalty does not apply to the End of Module quizzes or Graded Learning Activities because they will not be graded if submitted past the end of the Grace Period.</strong><br/><br/>Again, try to submit all assessments by the deadline to avoid any problems with late penalties, as indicated in the <strong>Course Schedule</strong>, and be sure not to leave your submission until the last minute before the end of the Grace Period because you will likely have technical issues or have forgotten to submit the Academic Integrity Quiz as well as the Academic Integrity Checklist (for assignments) which would prevent you from quickly submitting your assignment to dropbox when you intended.<br/><br/>For clarity, a "day late" means the student submitted within the first 24 hours following the end of the Grace Period (which usually ends at 11:59pm). So on the last day of the Grace Period, if a student submits any time between 12:00am to 11:59pm the day following the end of the Grace Period then a 10% penalty is incurred; an additional 25% late penalty will be assigned for each additional day (or portion of a 24 hour period) late.</p><p>Please note that in the University of Waterloo's new policy on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences"><u>Undergraduate student short-term absences</u></a>, the 48-hour self-declared absence will be included as part of the existing Grace Period. This means that if you self-declare on the day an assessment is due, you will be given the 48 hours but these will be included as Grace Period days (i.e., you will not receive 48 hours plus additional Grace Period days). Please ask the instructor if you have any questions about this policy.</p><h3>Grace Period</h3><p>All students are expected to meet the assessment due dates (i.e. Assignments, Quizzes, and Graded Learning Activities). However, unexpected circumstances (health issues, family emergencies, etc.) may arise during the course of preparing an assessment ahead of the due date. To minimize the amount of paperwork and emails around these circumstances, you will be granted a grace period. This is the period between the <strong>Due Date</strong> and "<strong>Grace Period Ends"</strong> in the <strong>Course Schedule</strong>. This means that if an illness or circumstance arises in advance of the due date, you will have time to recover and then submit your assessment without penalty up to the end of the grace period. <strong>No email is required; you automatically are given the Grace Period.</strong> Please note: the grace period is not an extension. If your illness or any other circumstance takes place AFTER the due date (i.e., during the grace period), then you will not be granted an additional extension beyond the grace period for that assessment.  Any illness or circumstance that begins before the due date and continues beyond the grace period will require an official <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/sites/ca.campus-wellness/files/uploads/files/verification_of_illness_form.v2_use.pdf"><u>Verification of Illness form</u></a> from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic"><u>Student Medical Clinic</u></a> or your physician.</p><p>In these cases, contact the course instructor as soon as possible – and no later than one-week – after the original due date. Be aware that submitting a note that has been altered or obtained under false pretences is considered a very serious offence by the University. Submitting documentation does <i>not </i>guarantee that you will be allowed to submit the assignment late. Please see the University’s full accommodation policy: <a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations"><u>Accommodations</u></a>.<br/><br/>The Grace Period follows universal learning design (ULD) principles and will be considered as part of accommodations given to students registered with AccessAbility Services where appropriate.<br/><br/>Please note that in the University of Waterloo's new policy on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences"><u>Undergraduate student short-term absences</u></a>, the 48-hour self-declared absence will be included as part of the existing Grace Period. This means that if you self-declare on the day an assessment is due, you will be given the 48 hours but these will be included as Grace Period days (i.e., you will not receive 48 hours plus additional Grace Period days). Please ask the instructor if you have any questions about this policy.</p><h3>Assignment Regrade Policy</h3><p>Do not email the instructor until you have read and completed the following.</p><p>Your Teaching Assistants make every effort to give you a fair grade based on the quality of your work. The grading rubric is carefully laid out for each assignment. Please be sure to read the rubric <strong>before starting your assignment</strong>. If after receiving your grade you feel your mark does not reflect the quality of your work:</p><ol><li><strong>Within two weeks</strong> of receiving your grade, <strong>but no sooner than 48 hours</strong> after receiving your grade, email your TA a formal letter in a document (.doc/.docx/.odt) that requests an assignment regrade.  Be sure to includes all of the following information:<ol><li>your name and student number;</li><li>the name of the assignment;</li><li>date assignment was due and date when you submitted.<br/>In discussing your assignment and grade be sure to make specific reference to the grading rubric; the assignment instructions; and the TA's feedback.</li></ol></li><li>The TA will then re-grade your assignment. <strong> **Please note that your mark can be raised, lowered, or remain the same through a re-grade**</strong></li><li>If you believe your re-graded mark still does not reflect your effort/achievement, then you can appeal your assignment grade by emailing the instructor. <strong>**Please note that your mark can be raised, lowered, or remain the same through a re-grade, in addition or subtraction to what the TA has given you.** </strong>Please submit your paper for consideration by email to the instructor no later than <strong>one week</strong> following your receipt of the decision by the TA.  Include a formal business letter that includes the following information:<ol><li>your name and student number;</li><li>the name of the assignment;</li><li>date assignment was due and date when you submitted;</li><li>name of your TA</li><li>your original grade, and the TA's amended grade following their re-grade;</li><li>an explanation of why you think you deserve a higher grade with specific reference to the grading rubric, the assignment instructions and your TA's original and amended feedback.</li></ol></li><li>If you still feel that your rights have been grieved, then you can request a formal reassessment procedure under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70"><u>Policy 70 - Student Petitions and Grievances</u></a>. Pay close attention to the timeline and deadlines and your responsibilities for communication with the instructor (referred to as the “Individual” in this case) as listed under Appendix B.</li></ol><h3>Other Accommodations</h3><p>The University acknowledges that, due to the pluralistic nature of the University community, some students may seek accommodations on religious grounds. Accordingly, students must consult with their instructor(s) within one week of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought. Failure to provide a timely request will decrease the likelihood of providing an accommodation.</p><p>Elective arrangements (such as travel plans) are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an accommodation.</p><h4>AccessAbility Accommodations</h4><p>If you have an accessibility need that requires accommodation please refer to the AccessAbility Services section of the <strong>University Policies</strong> page for further details.</p><h3>Intellectual Property</h3><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience.  However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials.  However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h2>Department Policies</h2><h3>Academic Integrity</h3><p>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.  For further details, you may read more about The University’s guiding principles on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/"><u>Academic Integrity</u></a>.</p><p>Students are also expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offenses, and to take responsibility for their actions. Students who are unsure whether an action constitutes an offense, or who need help in learning how to avoid offenses (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course professor, academic advisor, or the Undergraduate Associate Dean. As part of this course students are expected to complete the Library's <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/get-assignment-and-research-help/academic-integrity/academic-integrity-tutorial"><u>Academic Integrity Tutorial</u></a>, in addition to Academic Integrity quizzes included in this course. These components will allow students to acknowledge that they understand the grounds of academic integrity and agree to abide by the principles of academic integrity.</p><p>Note: Cutting and pasting even a partial sentence without proper quotations and referencing IS considered plagiarism.</p><p>When misconduct has been found to have occurred, disciplinary penalties will be imposed under Policy 71 – Student Discipline. For information on categories of offenses and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71 - Student Discipline</u></a>.</p><p>Students who believe that they have been wrongfully or unjustly penalized have the right to be aggrieved; refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70"><u>Policy 70 - Student Petitions and Grievances</u></a>.</p><p>Please note that the instructor reserves the right to ask you to speak with them in person about any assignment you have submitted for marks. This may include a request to show drafts or previously saved versions of your assignment and for you to walk the instructor through the logic, arguments, and sources of your assignment.</p><h3>Grievances or Appeals</h3><h4>Grievances</h4><p>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of his/her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. See <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70"><u>Policy 70 - Student Petitions and Grievances</u></a>, Section 4. When in doubt please contact your Undergraduate Advisor for details.</p><h4>Appeals</h4><p>A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70 - Student Petitions and Grievances (other than a petition) or Policy 71 - Student Discipline may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72"><u>Policy 72 - Student Appeals</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><p><strong>Declaring an absence: </strong>Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, instructors maintain agency over decisions regarding course component accommodations.  </p><p>Self-declared absences (for flu-like illness, short-term 48 hour self declared absences) must be submitted through Quest.</p><p>Absences requiring documentation (e.g. Verification of Illness Form, bereavement, etc.) - send your documentation to env-vif@uwaterloo. Do not send documentation to your advisor, course instructor, teaching assistant, or lab coordinator. Submission to env-vif@uwaterloo.ca<a href=""> </a>will notify all of your instructors of your absence. </p>
</div>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
