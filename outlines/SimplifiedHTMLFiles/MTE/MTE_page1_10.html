<p>Dynamics is the study of motion, its patterns and causes. This is a first course in dynamics limited to planar motion of particles and rigid bodies. It covers:</p><p>• planar kinematics: the patterns of motion of particles and rigid bodies in a plane</p><p>• planar kinetics: unbalanced forces and their relationship with motion.</p>

<p>- There will be a total of 8 assignments. The lowest two will be dropped and the rest will be weighted equally.</p><p>- We will use WileyPlus via Learn for assignments. Problem sets will be assigned on Tuesdays as listed in the class calendar. They are due by the following Sunday at 11:59 PM.</p><p>- Please let the TAs know by 5:00PM Tuesday via the class channel on Teams, if you would like them to address a particular problem during Friday's tutorial. You are also welcome to ask questions on this channel outside office hours.</p><p>- The project will be carried out in groups of 4. Each group should elect a lead to report the group composition (members) on Crowdmark and act as their point of contact. The project will be assigned on Monday, March 3. The project report is due by Friday, April 4.</p><p>- Exams are closed book - open formula sheet. Problems are a mixture of “solve” and “explain”. Your answer sheet should reflect the thought process and analysis you went through to arrive at your answers not just the final result. I am interested in how you <i>think </i>about and <i>analyze </i>a problem more than whether you ‘got’ the right answer.</p>

<div>
<p>Student Notice of Recording </p><p>Activities for this course involve recording, in partial fulfillment of the course learning outcomes. Recorded images and audio of the lecture may be used and/or made available by the University to you and other students for the purpose of material review. Recordings will be managed according to the University records classification scheme, WatClass, and will be securely destroyed when no longer needed by the University. Your personal information is protected in accordance with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, as well as University policies and guidelines and may be subject to disclosure where required by law. </p><p>The University will use reasonable means to protect the security and confidentiality of the recorded information, but cannot provide a guarantee of such due to factors beyond the University’s control, such as recordings being forwarded, copied, intercepted, circulated, disclosed, or stored without the University’s knowledge or permission, or the introduction of malware into computer system which could potentially damage or disrupt the computer, networks, and security settings. </p><p>By engaging in course activities that involve recording, you are consenting to the use of your appearance, image, text/chat messaging, and voice and/or likeness in the manner and under the conditions specified herein. </p><p>You are not permitted to disclose the link to/URL of an event or an event session recording or copies of recording to anyone, for any reason. Recordings are available only to authorized individuals who have been directly provided the above instructions/link for their use. Recordings for personal use, required to facilitate your learning and preparation of personal course/lecture notes, should not be shared with others without the permission of the instructor. Review the University’s guidelines for faculty, staff and students entering relationships with external organizations offering access to course materials for more information on your obligations with respect to keeping copies of course materials.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong><u>Class Policies:</u></strong></p><p>- My questions are not rhetorical. I would really appreciate your feedback.</p><p>- If you are not sure you got it, ask. If my pace is too fast, ask.</p><p>- Do not talk with others in class. If you need to discuss something, take a break to discuss it outside.</p><p>- Some classes may follow an ‘inverted’ structure. You will need to read the Lecture Notes before coming to class. I will spend the the first 10 minutes of the lecture going over a summary and answering any questions you may have then solve problems for the rest of class.</p><p> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
