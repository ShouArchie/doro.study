<p><strong>Course Evaluation </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Comprehensive Checks:</strong></p><p>Comprehensive Checks will be conducted on Learn multiple times throughout the term. It will be open-book, meaning that students can access their learning materials. However, collaboration is not allowed, meaning that students must complete it on their own without communicating with others. A time window will be set up for students to choose the best time to start the comprehensive check. Once started, each comprehensive check must be completed within the given time. This limited time requires students to be familiar with the learning materials and complete all questions quickly before the time runs out.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Participation Activities:</strong></p><p>Weekly attendance activities starting from week 2. Every week the instructor will have a 5 min participation activity in the form of a game/quiz (Kahoot style) in class. This will be unannounced and could be during any lecture day and any time during the lecture (beginning, middle or end). It is every student’s responsibility to attend the class. Those will be marked for completion/participation not correctness. The split of the grade is to reward attending the activities. Missing those will be penalized as follows:</p><p> </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Total Activities Missed</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>PA Weight (out of 9%)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>&lt;=2</p></td><td><p>9%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>8%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>7%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>6%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>5%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>4%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>3%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9</p></td><td><p>2%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>&gt;=10</p></td><td><p>0%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p> </p><p>Valid reasons (medical note, short-absence, interviews, any other occasions will not be accepted) approved by the instructor can result in waiving any missed session. </p><p> </p><p>Any student registered with AccessAbility Services who has concerns about accommodations for these deliverables to talk to their Accommodation Consultant and the course instructor by week 2 of the term.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Sharing the code of the session with other classmates that are not present is an academic integrity breach and will be subject to the consequences that could extend to failing the course. In the case of a breach that is unknown the whole class will loose 1 point on their final mark for every breach up to a maximum of 9 points. </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Lab Assignments:</strong></p><p>Assignments will be managed using GitLab at UWaterloo. You will have the chance to work on your assignments during the weekly “Lab” time slot (Tuesdays). However, collaboration is limited, meaning that students are encouraged to discuss the problems with the instructor, TA, and other students, but directly copying from others’ code is not permitted. Sharing own assignment work with other students is also not permitted. Students should use original variable names and comment their code thoroughly with explanation to demonstrate originality. Plagiarism detection tools will be used. Individual interview may be conducted, where a student is asked to explain the completed work to the instructor and TA.</p><p>Late penalty: work submitted after the due time may be penalized 0-100% of the points scored, depending on the cause of late submission. A student must save a copy of the submitted work on his or her personal computer or personal file system in case of any website problem. The student must not make any change to the saved copy of the submitted work. If the student is not able to provide a saved copy when requested by the instructor or if she/he makes any change to it after submission, that work may receive 0 credit.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Midterm and Final Exams:</strong></p><p>Each student must complete the exam solely by her or his own efforts. Learning materials and notes prepared before an exam are allowed in an open-book exam. Access to calculators and programming environment is allowed.</p><p>Any missed mid-term exam will receive a mark of 0, unless there is a valid documented reason approved by the instructor. If such a reason is provided and accepted by the instructor, the mid-term weight may be applied to the final exam. If a student is unable to write the final exam, they need to notify the instructor at least 24 hours before the exam (as earlier as possible).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Grade Disputes:</strong></p><p>All grade disputes must be returned with a written (email) explanation to the instructor within one week from the date when the score is released. The reasons must be clearly explained using a logical argument and supported using materials from the class (e.g., textbook and lecture notes) when necessary. Re-grade requests without written justifications will not be considered.</p><p> </p>

<p><strong>Course Expectations </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Deadlines and Late Penalties: </strong>Course deliverables submitted after the due date will be assigned a grade of zero (0). This penalty may be waived at the discretion of the instructor in the event of extraordinary or special circumstances (with supporting verification/documentation). </p><p><strong>Absence Due to Special Circumstances or Illness: </strong>Let Charbel know in advance if you need to be away due to special circumstances. In the event of illness that prevents attendance or participation in mandatory course activities, a Health Services Verification of Illness form must be completed by an authorized medical practitioner. See www.healthservices.uwaterloo.ca/Health_Services/verification.html and the associated policy: Accommodation due to illness. </p><p> </p><p><strong>UW Policy on Attendance: “</strong>Students are expected to attend all scheduled components of the courses in which they have enrolled. Students may be required to present documentation confirming the reasons for non-attendance. During the course add period, students may be removed from a course for non-attendance. Students who are removed from a class will be notified by the Registrar's Office.” <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Class-Attendance">https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Class-Attendance</a> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Academic Integrity: </strong>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check the Office of Academic Integrity: www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/ for more information.] </p><p> </p><p><strong>Discipline</strong>: A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity (see link above) to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g. plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate Associate Dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <i>Policy 71, Student Discipline </i>www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm. For typical penalties check <i>Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</i>, <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/guidelines/penaltyguidelines.htm">www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/guidelines/penaltyguidelines.htm</a>. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Grievance</strong>: A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <i>Policy70, Student Petitions and Grievances</i>, <i>Section 4 </i>www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy70.htm.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>

Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
