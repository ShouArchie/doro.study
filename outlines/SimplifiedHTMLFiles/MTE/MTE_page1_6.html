<p>MTE 120 is the course designator for an introductory circuits course divided into two main topics: electromagnetism and electric circuits. The electromagnetism portion explores the physics behind electric charge, electricity and magnetism. The electric circuits portion builds on the ideas from electromagnetism to explore fundamental circuit ideas and build a toolbox for solving circuit problems. The course concludes with a brief introduction to some more advanced circuit elements.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall Grade Calculation</strong></h3><p>Your overall grade is calculated differently depending on your midterm and final exam marks. 𝑀 is your midterm average grade out of 100 % and 𝐹 is your final examination grade out of 100 %:</p><p>If 20/68𝑀 + 48/68𝐹 ≥ 55, your grade will be calculated as follows:</p><ul><li>Labs &amp; tutorials: 25 %</li><li>Online graded assignments: 7 %</li><li>Midterm: 20 %</li><li>Final Examination: 48 %</li></ul><p>If 20/68𝑀 + 48/68𝐹 ≤ 40, that is your final grade.</p><p>Otherwise, the weight of labs and online assignments will drop linearly from 32 % to 0 % as the calculated grade of your quizzes and final drops from 55 % to 40 %.</p><p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p><ol><li>A grade of INC (Incomplete) is to be assigned if you do not satisfactorily attempt 8 of 9 labs. If the labs are not completed within 4 months of the end of the course to the satisfaction of the course instructor, the INC (Incomplete) grade will be converted to FTC (Failure to Complete). If the lab studies are completed successfully within the required timeframe, the overall grade will be calculated according to the formula provided with a grade of 0 used for any deliverables that were incomplete at the time of overall grade calculation.</li><li>A grade of DNW (Did Not Write) is to be assigned if you do not write the final examination for any reason other than an acceptable, verifiable illness.</li><li>The instructor reserves the right to use alternative grading schemes in exceptional circumstances.</li></ol><h3>Deliverables</h3><p>All tutorials are completed during the tutorial period. All labs and ZC assignments are due at <strong>11:00 pm</strong>. The following schedule is tentative. If changes are required to ensure alignment with lecture content students will be notified via an announcement on Learn.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Week</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Deliverable</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Weight (%)</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Deadline</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>1</strong></p></td><td>Tutorial 0</td><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>Wed. Jan 8</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3"><p> </p><p><strong>2</strong></p></td><td>Lab 1</td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>Mon.

Many topics include interactive problems to help you practice applying the concepts. While only challenge problems are included in the <strong>graded assignment</strong>, you are strongly encouraged to use the participation problems to check your understanding of key concepts as they are taught. Each graded assignment is marked on completion of the corresponding practice problems before the assignment deadline. You have unlimited attempts of each problem. There are 8 assignments throughout the term, each of which is worth 1% per assignment, to a maximum of 7%. If you are struggling with an assignment, please seek help from a TA, first year tutor or the instructor. Assignments completed after the deadline will receive a grade of 0 unless an extension has been granted by the instructor due to extenuating circumstances.</p><p><strong>Ungraded problem sets</strong> are posted on Learn each week, final answers are included with the problem set and full solutions are posted the following week. Problem sets are not handed in; however, completion of these problems will allow you to regularly test and reinforce your comprehension of the concepts and analysis techniques presented throughout the term. Weekly completion will also help with pacing of the course. If you are struggling with a problem set, please seek help from a TA, first year tutor or the instructor.</p><h4>Tutorials and Labs</h4><p>Tutorial problems are completed <strong>individually </strong>and are graded during the tutorial. Lab studies are to be completed <strong>in pairs</strong>. Your lab report will be submitted to <strong>Crowdmark</strong>. It must be submitted by <strong>11:00 pm on the day you complete the lab</strong>. Submissions up to 1 hour late will have a 25% penalty applied. A submission more than 1 hour late will have a 50% penalty applied. A submission that is more than 1 day late will not be accepted. If you anticipate needing to submit late for an unavoidable reason, you must contact the <strong>lab instructor </strong>before the deadline to discuss alternative arrangements. In the case of an emergency where you are unable to contact the lab instructor before the deadline, you must contact the lab instructor as soon as possible after the emergency has been dealt with. You may be asked for documentation to obtain an extension. Extensions will not be granted for reasons such as having too many assignments due. You are required to attempt at least 8 of the 9 labs. If there are outstanding labs at the end of the course, a grade of INC will be assigned until the labs are completed.</p><p>TAs and lab staff are available to assist you. Discussion between students is encouraged, but copying is prohibited. <strong><u>You are expected to prepare, perform and document lab experiments as your own work. This means you must</u> <u>not copy the calculations, measured data, or write up from other students (including submissions from previous</u> <u>terms).</u></strong> You are welcome to ask your classmates questions, but complete lab reports should never be shared. </p><p><strong><u>Repeating the Course</u></strong></p><p>Repeating students often have questions related to the completion of deliverables in the course. Students repeating this course are expected to participate in the course fully. The following material provides further clarification:</p><p><strong>Do I have to do the labs/tutorials again? </strong><i>Yes, we expect repeating students to participate fully in all aspects of the course.</i></p><p><strong>Can I reuse material from previous lab/tutorial submissions? </strong><i>No, you must start with a blank page and redo the calculations and labs as though you are completing them for the first time.</i></p><p>If you have any other questions related to repeating the course, please e-mail your course instructor.</p><h4>“Picture a Scientist” screening</h4><p>During the Tuesday, March 25 lecture the documentary film “Picture a Scientist” will be shown, followed by a review activity. Attendance is optional but strongly encouraged. A bonus of 0.5% will be added to the final course grade for anyone who actively participates in this activity. </p><h4>Exams</h4><p>Written exams are the primary form of assessment used in this course. There will be two exams. A midterm will be held during midterm week and a final exam will be held during the final exam period.</p><p><strong><u>Midterm</u></strong><br/>The midterm is <strong>90 minutes </strong>in length. This is a closed book exam to be written in person. During the exam, no questions will be answered by the teaching team to ensure fairness for all students. Further details on the midterm will be provided on Learn at least one week before the exam. You will be provided with a copy of the formula sheet and may use a <strong>non-graphing calculator</strong>. No other resources are permitted.</p><p>Missing the midterm due to illness or a declared absence will result in the weight of the midterm exam being shifted to the final exam, provided that illness has been self-declared on Quest or a VOI has been submitted in accordance with current First Year Office guidelines, and you have notified the First Year Engineering Office and the course instructor. If the illness is not declared or if the explanation is not deemed acceptable, a grade of 0 will be assigned as the midterm grade. The weight of the examination will not be changed under any other circumstances. Declaration of illness forms must be submitted within 48 hours in accordance with university policy.</p><p><strong><u>Final Exam</u></strong><br/>The final exam is a <strong>150 minute</strong>, closed-book exam. The exam is cumulative. During the exam, no questions will be answered by the proctors to ensure fairness for all students. Further details on the final exam will be provided on Learn at least one week in advance. You will be provided with a copy of the formula sheet and may use a <strong>non- graphing calculator</strong>. No other resources are permitted.</p><p>Missing the final exam due to illness will result in an assigned grade of INC (Incomplete) provided that illness is self- declared on Quest or a VOI is completed in accordance with current First Year Office guidelines, and you have notified the First Year Engineering Office and the course instructor. The grade of INC (Incomplete) will be resolved by a deferred exam within 4 months of the end of the course. If no deferred exam is written within that timeframe, the grade will be converted to FTC (Failure to Complete). If the illness cannot be verified or if the explanation is not deemed acceptable, a grade of DNW (Did Not Write) will be submitted for the student.</p><p>Every effort will be made to provide a makeup exam on the last day of exams for students that are verifiably ill during the scheduled final exam slot. If you are ill and unable to write the final exam as scheduled, you are expected to be available for the makeup exam. <i>The timing of this makeup exam will be determined once it is known which other exams on that date are to be written by the students who were ill.</i></p><p>***In the event that the University releases updated guidelines on the declaration of illness for the Winter 2025 term, those guidelines will supersede the declaration instructions in this document.***</p><p><u>Confidentiality of Tests: </u><br/>The content of all tests used in this course are confidential. It is a violation of academic integrity to convey and/or transmit content from any test to another person by any means. Further, it is a violation of academic integrity to record, copy, photograph, or store images or descriptions of the content of tests, for any purpose other than completion of the test (online exams only) and the review of your work. Please delete/destroy all copies after final grades are released for the term. Copies of old exams that have been released by the teaching team for your use as study aids are no longer confidential.</p><p> </p>
