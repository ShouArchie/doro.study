<p>This course introduces the treatment of ordinary differential equations. Specifically, we define what ordinary differential equations are and how they relate to the physical problems encountered in simplified engineering systems. Techniques for solving first and higher order differential equations, linear equations with constant and variable coefficients, and non-linear equations are introduced. Applications involving simple dynamical systems and principles of mass, momentum, and heat conservation will emphasize the role of ordinary differential equations in understanding the behaviour of physical systems. Particular emphasis will be placed on formulating differential equations from the physical description of a system.</p>

<p>Note that the final grade is calculated as the max of the above or </p><p>21% projects (7% each), 35% midterm, 44% final</p><p> </p><p>Crowdmark will  be used for submitting your projects. But note that your allocated grade will be found on LEARN. This means <strong>your grade on LEARN for a graded component will be taken as your grade when calculating your final overall grade. </strong></p><p> </p><h4><strong>Midterm and Final</strong></h4><p>The midterm will assess <strong>all</strong> topics from lectures prior to reading week (Lec 1 - Lec 19). </p><p>The post midterm techniques will often have the pre-midterm techniques embedded within them. So this means that all topics will be considered examinable for the final. This does not mean that all topics will be examined on the final. Simply that they are open to be used or may be encountered as a sub-method of a post-midterm technique. Hence the final will consider Lec 1 - Lec 36. </p><p>Both the midterm and the final will have all integrals required on the front page of the exam sheet. You will be permitted calculators and a single sided (US letter page - 8.5 by 11 inches) cheat sheet where you can write anything you want except worked examples. </p><p> </p><h4><strong>Projects</strong></h4><p>Project 1 -  Released: Jan 13, Due Feb 2</p><p>Project 2 -  Released: Feb 3, Due Mar 9</p><p>Project 3 -  Released: Mar 10, Due Mar 30</p><p>Can work alone or in pairs and will be submitted via crowdmark no later than 11:59 pm on the respective due date.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>Problem Sets (not assessed) </strong></h4><p>On Monday of each week problem sets will be uploaded to help facilitate your learning. Solutions to these problem sets will be available on LEARN the following Monday. The solutions will not <i>always </i>be complete worked solutions but simply a presentation of the main points. This is done intentionally. The point of the problem sets is to help you see where you are weak and thus seek help from me or the tutors.</p>
