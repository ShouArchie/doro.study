  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>MTE 380:</div>
<p>In this course, students study the design process, including needs analysis, problem definition; design criteria and critical parameter identification, generation of alternative solutions; conceptual design, detailed design, optimization; and implementation. Most of the term is devoted to a significant design project in which student groups work independently and competitively, applying the design process to a project goal set by the faculty coordinator. The design project typically includes construction of an electro-mechanical prototype, and part of the course grade may depend on the performance of the prototype in a competitive test. In exceptional circumstances, the requirement for a prototype may be replaced by a computer simulation, or may be waived.</p>

<h4>Learning Outcomes</h4><p>The goals of this course are to gain experience with the nature, demands, and ramifications of the engineering design process. The students will gain an understanding of the complexity, difficulty, and time span involved in solving real open-ended problems. By the end of the course the students will be able to apply the design process to identify a need, formulate a problem</p><p>statement along with design specifications, generate alternative solutions, and implement their chosen solution. Students will be able to communicate the application of the design process through report writing and presentations.</p><p>The primary learning outcomes that are covered in MTE 380 are:</p><ul><li>Apply the design process<ul><li>Needs analysis</li><li>Problem formulation<ul><li>Problem statement</li><li>Objectives</li><li>Constraints</li><li>Criteria</li></ul></li><li>Conceptual/preliminary design<ul><li>Idea generation</li><li>Conceptual design selection</li></ul></li><li>Detailed Design (applying the theory from your other courses: design calculations, CAD drawings)</li><li>Implementation (construction, commissioning, testing, demonstration)</li></ul></li><li>Ability to communicate your design<ul><li>Report writing</li><li>Presentations</li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><p>The secondary goals are not covered in depth in the lecture content, but my observation shows there is a lot of skill development and learning that happens through the project such as:</p><ul><li>Manage a multi-discipline project<ul><li>Work plan, negotiation, execution, evaluation</li><li>Decisions and tradeoffs</li><li>Project control via schedule and budget</li><li>Vendor relations</li><li>Resource limitations</li></ul></li><li>Develop leadership/membership in team efforts:<ul><li>Team planning</li><li>Division of work, delegation</li><li>Authority/responsibility/accountability</li><li>Resolution of personal conflict</li><li>Negotiation</li><li>Utilization of a variety of talents and skills</li><li>Personnel evaluation and criticism</li><li>Error correction/risk mitigation</li></ul></li><li>To increase students' ability to apply course material, from this course and others:<ul><li>Recognize applications and limitations</li><li>Reality vs. model</li></ul></li></ul><p> </p>

When emailing the TAs, please send the email to both TAs to expedite replies.</p><h4>Course Information</h4><p>“Engineering (design) is like dancing; you don’t learn it in a darkened lecture hall watching slides: you learn it by getting out on the dance floor and having your toes stepped on.”</p><p>-Jack Alford, Professor of Engineering Emeritus, Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA, USA.</p><p>Science, math, and engineering problems that you see in academia are usually well posed. The solution is unique, you know when you have solved the problem, and the problems you are solving have a narrow solution area. Design problems, however, are usually poorly posed, they can be ambiguous, and they rarely have unique solutions and you may not be sure if you have actually solved the problem. Design problems are usually multi-disciplinary.</p><p>MTE 380 is intended to be a “hands-on” and practical course different from already existing design courses. Design, construction, testing, and competition are the main features of this course. Having an understanding of previous and current courses will be necessary. Students study the design process, including needs analysis, problem definition, design constraints and criteria, generation and development of alternative solutions; conceptual design, detail design, optimization, and implementation. A significant design project is the centerpiece of this course.</p><p> </p><h4>Course Calendar</h4><p>The schedule for the term is provided in Table 1.</p><p>Table 1: Course calendar.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Date</strong></td><td><strong>Lecture</strong></td><td><strong>Project Items Due</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>January 10</p><p>Friday</p><p>1:30 - 2:20 pm</p></td><td>Introduction, Term Project and Project Planning</td><td>No Deliverables</td></tr><tr><td>January 17</td><td>Needs &amp; Problem Formulation<strong><sup>*</sup></strong></td><td><p>Milestone 0a: Group Registration,</p><p>Milestone 1a: Camera module workshop </p></td></tr><tr><td>January 24</td><td><p>Conceptual Design and</p><p>Morphological Box<strong><sup>*</sup></strong></p><p>Also see a Case Study to be posted on Learn</p></td><td><p>Milestone 0b: Group Contract,</p><p>Milestone 1b: Interface module workshop</p></td></tr><tr><td>January 31</td><td><p>Detailed Design<strong><sup>*</sup></strong> </p><p>Calculation template</p></td><td> No Deliverables</td></tr><tr><td>February 7</td><td><p>Report Writing<strong><sup>*</sup></strong></p><p>Commissioning, Testing, and Analysis</p></td><td>Milestone 2: Presentation – Proposal and Conceptual Designs</td></tr><tr><td>February 14</td><td>Design for Assembly<strong><sup>*</sup></strong></td><td>Milestone 3: Memo - Calculations</td></tr><tr><td>February 21</td><td colspan="2"><p>Reading Week – No Lecture and Deliverables</p></td></tr><tr><td>February 28</td><td colspan="2"><p>Midterm Week – No Lecture and Deliverables</p></td></tr><tr><td>March 7</td><td>No Lecture</td><td>Milestone 4: Check-Up - Construction Check</td></tr><tr><td>March 14</td><td>No Lecture</td><td>Milestone 5: Presentation – Design Specification</td></tr><tr><td>March 21</td><td>FYDP information</td><td>Milestone 6: Check-Up - Design Specification Check</td></tr><tr><td>March 28</td><td colspan="2"><p>Milestone 7: GAME DAY!</p></td></tr><tr><td>April 4</td><td>No Lecture</td><td>Milestone 8: Final Report</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>* Lectures with quizzes</p><p> </p>

<h4>Midterm and Final Exam</h4><p>There will not be any final or midterm exams for this course. Instead, there will be quizzes corresponding to designated lectures, as detailed in Table 1. </p><h4>Grading</h4><p>The grading in this course will be based on:</p><ol><li>The Project<ol><li>Design and Build<ol><li>Quality of design and build</li><li>Able to follow the design process</li><li>Design and construction checks</li></ol></li><li>Report Writing<ol><li>Quality of reports</li><li>Able to follow the design process</li><li>Design analysis, calculations, simulations</li><li>Adequacy and appropriateness of analysis, syntheses, tests, conclusions, computer, and shop work</li></ol></li><li>Presentation<ol><li>Professional presentation</li><li>Everyone contributes</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Game Day Performance</li><li>Participation in workshops on the camera and interface modules</li><li>Quizzes<ol><li>Based on the lectures</li></ol></li><li>Peer Evaluation (group project, optional)<ol><li>Did you contribute to your team’s success or not?</li><li>Initiative and imagination in taking responsibility either as a leader, or in volunteering as a team member</li><li>Taking obligations seriously in meeting deadlines</li><li>Active participation in team meetings</li></ol></li></ol><p><strong>Quizzes</strong></p><p>Lecture-specific quizzes will be accessible on Learn at the conclusion of each lecture, with a deadline set for the next day (Saturday) by 11:59 pm. Lectures with quizzes are marked with an asterisk (*) in Table 1. The quizzes contribute 10% to the overall course grade. Please note that we are unable to extend the quiz deadline for individuals without a valid reason. According to UW policy, if students provide acceptable documentation (e.g., the self-declared short-term absence, doctor’s certificate, Verification of Illness form, police report), missed quizzes, midterms, and final exams can be accommodated.</p><h4><i>Milestone Deliverables and Policies</i></h4><p><strong>Learn Deliverables</strong></p><p>Milestones 0, 3, and 8 are due by 11:59 pm through Learn. Late submissions for these milestones, unless otherwise noted, receive a deduction of 5 marks per day. By policy, the usage of the short-term leave of absence on Quest will allow for a 2-day (not business days) extension.</p><p><strong>Workshops</strong></p><p>Milestones 1a and 1b workshops will be conducted during the project hours on the days specified above. The usage of short-term absence on Quest is not applicable to workshops as this is a lab exercise. 100% of the deliverable’s mark will be deducted for any individual who does not attend without an excuse approved by the teaching team.</p><p><strong>Presentations and Check-ins</strong></p><p>Presentations and Check-ins will be conducted by the TAs in-person on the days specified above for each one of the milestones (no written report submission is required – you can use your design notebooks when sharing your calculations with the TAs). Due to the limit of TAs available for the course, presentations and check-ins may occur outside of the designated times for MTE 380. Scheduling will be conducted on a first come first serve basis via an online sign-up sheet. The usage of short-term absence on Quest will not be applicable to these deliverables as it is considered a lab exercise. If a conflict occurs in which one of your team members cannot attend due to an emergency, extra-curricular event, etc., your group must contact the TAs as soon as possible to reschedule a make-up session. The teaching team reserves the right to deny a rescheduling request if the conflict event is deemed to not be a valid excuse or no proof for the excuse is presented. 100% of the deliverable’s mark will be deducted for any individual who does not attend without an excuse approved by the teaching team.</p><p><strong>Game Day</strong></p><p>Game Day will occur on March 28<sup>th</sup> during the designated MTE 380 timeslots. All students are expected to attend if a prior excuse of absence has not been approved. The usage of short-term absence on Quest is not applicable to Game Day as this is a lab exercise. 100% of the deliverable’s mark will be deducted for any individual who does not attend without an excuse approved by the teaching team.</p><p><strong>Peer Evaluations (Optional)</strong></p><p>An Excel spreadsheet for peer evaluations will be posted on Learn. It can be filled in by each individual and submitted via Learn/dropbox.</p><h4><i>Individual Journal</i></h4><p>Suggestions are to log what you are supposed to do each week and what you accomplished. There are no marks directly associated with the journal. If your project goes sideways, it will give the teaching team some insight to what you have done through the term. Likewise, if you have a dysfunctional group, it will allow us to better understand who has contributed and who has not.</p><h2>Term Project</h2><p>Location and time:  E3-3164 &amp; E7-1401, 2:30 – 4:20 pm Fridays as required. This also provides you with space and time for group meetings and to meet with the teaching team.</p><p>The bulk of this course is the term project. The Church Lab (E3-3164) and the Repair Hub (E7-1401) is reserved for MTE 380 on Friday afternoons, 2:30 – 4:20 pm. E3-3164 is available for students to use various electrical and soldering equipment and E7-1401 is available for students to use the obstacle course. A TA will be in each of these rooms during the designated project time. DWE-2524 is available through the term as well. MME staff and the course TAs will be available to provide assistance and schedule access to these work spaces to ensure public safety is maintained while the students are in the lab working on their projects.</p><h2>Project schedule / Milestones</h2><p>There will be nine major milestones during the term as per Table 3, each marked by completing workshops, a memo, presentations, constructed part check, device performance check, and a final report. These milestones are designed to help keep your team on track of where your progress should be throughout the term. </p><p>Table 3: Project Marking</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Deliverables</strong></td><td><strong>Mark</strong></td><td><strong>Due Date</strong></td><td><strong>Location</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Milestone</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p>0a</p></td><td>Group Registration</td><td>0%</td><td>January 17</td><td>Learn Groups</td></tr><tr><td><p>0b</p></td><td>Group Contract</td><td>0%</td><td>January 24</td><td>Learn Dropbox</td></tr><tr><td><p>1a</p></td><td>Camera module workshop participation </td><td>2.5%</td><td>January 17</td><td>E3-3164</td></tr><tr><td><p>1b</p></td><td>Interface module workshop participation</td><td>2.5%</td><td>January 24</td><td>E3-3164</td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td>Presentation – Proposal and Conceptual Design</td><td>10%</td><td>February 7</td><td><u>E5-3006 and E5 3052</u></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td>Memo  – Design Calculations (Individual)</td><td>10%</td><td>February 14</td><td>Learn Dropbox</td></tr><tr><td><p>4</p></td><td>Construction Check</td><td>10%</td><td>March 7</td><td>E3-3164 and E7-1401</td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td>Presentation – Design Specifications and Reflection</td><td>10%</td><td>March 14 </td><td><u>E5-3006 and E5 3052</u></td></tr><tr><td><p>6</p></td><td>Design Specification Check</td><td>5%</td><td>March 21</td><td>E3-3164 and E7-1401</td></tr><tr><td><p>7</p></td><td>Game Day</td><td>20%</td><td>March 28</td><td>E7-1401 and Ideas Clinic</td></tr><tr><td><p>8</p></td><td>Final Report</td><td>20%</td><td>April 4</td><td>Learn Dropbox</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h4>Milestone 0 (a and b): Team Formation and Team Contract</h4><p>Students work in project teams of four or five. The teams work on the design and construction of a project. The client (faculty) expects a level of effort of greater than 500 hours per term, per project team. To meet this goal, each student should plan to work an average of 8 hours per week on the project. The objective is to produce useful results on an authentic project to the client's satisfaction within the constraints of time and budget. The students do the work; the faculty informs, advises, coaches, and evaluates the results.</p><p>The proper formation of teams is essential for success. Each team should be comprised of members with the following skill sets: </p><ul><li>Planning and management functions</li><li>Leadership</li><li>Procurement</li><li>Material and parts selection</li><li>Machine shop and/or wood shop experience</li><li>CAD drawing expertise</li><li>Design analysis<ul><li>Mechanical</li><li>Electrical and electronics</li><li>Software</li></ul></li><li>Computer simulation</li><li>Microcontroller (Arduino, etc.) and computer programming</li><li>Microcontroller/Computer-sensor-actuator integration</li></ul><p>It is the responsibility of the students to make sure that their team has the proper skill sets to ensure success.  While students are free to pick their teammates, the teaching team reserves the right to alter team composition for a better distribution of skills. <u>If you are not registered in a group of 4 or 5 by the date stated above, the teaching team will form a team for you (if you are registered in a group of 3 or less, you may be split up into other groups). We encourage you to contact the TAs as soon as possible if you are having issues forming a team.</u><strong><u> </u></strong></p><p>As a part of working in a group you will create a group contract, which will then be applied to resolve any conflicts within the group. This contract should outline all member’s roles and responsibilities, and any penalties if group members do not fulfill their duties. If you do not contribute to your group you will lose marks, though the group must provide evidence that a member(s) did not contribute.</p><h4><strong>Milestone 1 (a and b): Tutorial workshops on the use of camera and interface boards</strong></h4><p>You are required to attend two tutorial workshops on using cameras and interface boards.. These workshops will be coordinated and assessed by Paul Groh.</p><p>Workshops Location and time: E3-3178, </p><p>Two Workshops will be held at the beginning of the term. Your attendance and task completion in these workshops will be graded. The teaching staff will provide a sign-up sheet for students to attend each workshop.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Workshop</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td><td><strong>Mark</strong></td><td><strong>Date</strong></td><td><strong>Location</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Webcam navigation</td><td>2.5%</td><td>January 17</td><td>E3-3178</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Interfacing Raspberry Pi with Elegoo</td><td>2.5%</td><td>January 24</td><td>E3-3178</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p> </p><h4><strong>Milestone 2: Presentation – Proposal and Conceptual Designs</strong></h4><p>After forming your group, each team must come to an agreement on a work plan, which covers the team's activities and expectations for the term. Writing and negotiating this document takes two to three weeks of consultation, background study, and revision at the beginning of the term. Included with this presentation are the details of the needs assessment, problem formulation, conceptual designs and the decision-making process that leads to the selected design. The following are among the considerations:</p><ul><li>The Problem<ul><li>What is understood from the problem?</li><li>Background information</li><li>Needs assessment</li><li>Problem formulation<ul><li>Problem statement</li><li>Desired functions and goals</li><li>Design specifications (objectives, constraints)</li><li>Design selection criteria</li></ul></li><li>Key design problems that need to be considered</li></ul></li><li>Project Planning<ul><li>Team resume</li><li>Work breakdown structure</li><li>Description of progress monitoring</li><li>Risk identification (technical, schedule, resources, cost, …) and risk mitigation plans</li><li>Responsibility assignment</li><li>Gantt chart</li><li>Budget</li><li>Required facilities and equipment</li></ul></li><li>Conceptual Design<ul><li>Morphological chart</li><li>Design concepts<ul><li>At least three different viable designs</li><li>Include freehand sketches of each conceptual design</li><li>Mapping of objectives and constraints to the design</li></ul></li><li>Evaluation of alternative designs<ul><li>Elimination process (if you have more than four design concepts, can any be eliminated instead of dragging a weak design through the evaluation process?)</li><li>Assigning weighting factors to design goals</li><li>Design rating and decision matrix – Explain and justify your numbers</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The high-level design of your device must be completed, including mechanical, electrical, electronics, microcontroller, actuators, sensors, power, and software and control algorithms.</li></ul><p>Each group will meet one on one with the teaching team to review your design. You are expected to demonstrate all the above within 20 minutes (with at least 2 minutes to spare for questions) during this formal presentation. </p><p>Please refer to the Milestone 2 rubric on LEARN for more details of what you are expected to demonstrate in this presentation.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>Milestone 3: Memo – Design Calculations (individual), 4 - 5 pages maximum</strong></h4><p>After your final design has been selected from Milestone 2, each individual should complete the calculations assigned in your presentation. You are expected to show detailed mechanical, electrical, software, and controls calculations. This includes, but are not limited to, detailed CAD parts and assembly, electrical diagrams with your microcontroller(s), detailed software and controls flow-charts and/or pseudo-code. These calculations are intended for you to determine the specifications for any parts you need to purchase for the project, so your team as a whole should calculate everything that your device needs to function in this milestone. Although these calculations are marked individually, it is encouraged for your team to check over each other’s work. </p><p>After these calculations are completed, you should place orders for required parts as soon as possible in preparation for the construction check. If you would like any immediate feedback at any time about your calculations to help with your parts purchasing, please feel free to contact the TAs. Otherwise please do not wait until the grades are released back to you before purchasing your parts as there is no guarantee that they will be returned to you with enough lead time for your parts purchasing. For any questions and assistance with purchasing, please contact Paul Groh.</p><p>Please refer to document MTE380 calculations list and Milestone 3 rubric on LEARN for details on what is expected to complete this milestone.</p><h4><strong>Milestone 4: Check-Up - Construction Check</strong></h4><p>Each group will meet one on one with the teaching team for an informal meeting (no presentation required). In this milestone, the bulk of your device should be assembled, and sub-components of your device should be working, and demonstrated live to the teaching team to check. Delays in part arrivals will not be an acceptable excuse if components are missing in this construction check, if substantial notice and proof of long delays are not provided to the teaching team. You are encouraged to take videos of your device working during testing for part marks if your device does not work on the day of the demo.  </p><p>Please refer to the Milestone 4 rubric on LEARN for more details of what you are expected to demonstrate in this check-up.</p><h4><strong>Milestone 5: Presentation</strong> - <strong>Design Specifications and Reflection</strong></h4><p>Each group will meet one on one with the teaching team for a formal presentation. The presentation should be cohesive and to receive marks everyone has to contribute in the discussion. Presentations should be limited to 10-15 minutes per group. The topics to discuss during the presentation are expected to include your design highlights, what is great about it, what worked, what didn’t work, problems you encountered and how they were resolved. One topic that must be discussed is your schedule. Did you follow your schedule, has the schedule been updated, what did you learn? You must also briefly introduce 3 design specifications that you aim to meet for Milestone 6 in the following week. </p><p>Please refer to the Milestone 5 rubric on LEARN for more details of what you are expected to demonstrate in this presentation.</p><h4><strong>Milestone 6: Check-Up - Design Specification Check</strong></h4><p>In Milestone 6, you will meet with the TAs for the final time for an informal check-up of your final design specifications. You will be evaluated on your device’s ability on achieving the specifications introduced in Milestone 5 and appropriate testing methods for the evaluation. You are required to meet 2/3 specifications for the chance of getting full marks. Importantly, the design specification must be measurable. For example, if one of your objectives is a velocity of 2 m/s, then you must demonstrate that your device can obtain 2 m/s. It is up to you to organize the demonstration. Know what you are going to do for your demonstration.</p><p>Please refer to the Milestone 6 rubric on LEARN for more details of what you are expected to demonstrate in this check-up.</p><p>At this point, your device should be fully functional with only minor testing and tuning left to complete ahead of Game Day the following week. </p><h4><strong>Milestone 7: Game Day</strong></h4><p>Game Day is the culmination of your efforts and is the most exciting part of this course. For more information, see the section with the project description. The marks for game day are based on the completion of the missions (i.e. your device’s ability to navigate the obstacle course and rescue the Lego-Person).</p><p>Bonus marks will be given to the best performing team based on the performance index (found under the project description section). Bonuses of +3%, +2%, +1% (to your overall grade) will be given to the teams who place 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> place respectively. </p><p>Please refer to the Milestone 7 rubric on LEARN for more details of what you are expected to demonstrate on Game Day.</p><h4><strong>Milestone 8: Final Report </strong></h4><p>This is the final document submitted. The focus on this report is on the construction phase, test results, competition results, and evaluation and comparison of predicted and achieved results. The following are among the considerations:</p><ul><li>Construction</li><li>How does the final device match up to the objectives and constraints?</li><li>Modifications and why</li><li>Test plan and results</li><li>Key features of the model</li><li>Prediction vs. real (analysis vs. results)</li><li>Competition results</li><li>Lessons learned</li></ul><p>Please refer to the Milestone 8 rubric on LEARN for a full list of what is expected in your final report, and refer to the report writing module and the report guidelines below for what is expected of your report.</p><p><strong>You must also include a one-page proposal (individual or group) for MTE 481/482 - follow the design process.</strong></p><h4>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h4><h4>Final Report</h4><p>The written reports are limited to 25 pages; figures, pictures, appendices, table of contents, and the executive summary are not included in the page limit. Refrain from using appendices; students tend to dump important material in the appendices that should be in the main body of the report, resulting in a lower mark. The type styles and formatting styles of the report are open; however, students are encouraged to use the same format used for the work term reports. The reports will be evaluated based on: report content (appropriateness, adequacy, comprehensiveness, originality, and significance), writing skills (clarity of communication, organization), and appearance and structure (quality of drawings and figures, layout, formatting). Important: Refer to the lecture on report writing and the rubrics (document: Final report marking scheme on LEARN) to gain a good understanding of what we look for when we mark technical reports.</p><h4>Construction</h4><p>Building and testing the project is a centerpiece of the course. During this phase of the project, teams will gain firsthand experience in manufacturing and assembling of a designed product. The following are among the considerations for this phase:</p><ul><li>Time needed to manufacture a part</li><li>Check materials and parts availability (consult with Paul Groh and Eugene Li as needed)</li><li>Lead time for purchasing materials</li><li>Student Machine Shop accessibility, safety rules and hours of operation</li><li>Try not to use mill or lathe machines, or minimize such use</li><li>Simplify design for easier manufacturability</li></ul><h3>The Project</h3><p>The centerpiece of this course is the project. The design process will be applied to the design, construction, and testing of a device that addresses the problem statement. The design process includes understanding the problem, identifying design objectives, constraints, and selection criteria, generating and developing design concepts, evaluation of design options, selection of the final design, detailed design analysis, technical drawings, construction, commissioning, and testing.</p><h4>Problem Statement</h4><p>The problem statement is: Design and build a device that execute a search and rescue (S&amp;R) mission to save a Lego person. The navigation course will contain sand, gravel, and empty traps. Please refer to file: MTE380 project description on LEARN to learn more about the task your device/robot is expected to complete on demo day. You are free to build a story around this problem statement.</p><h4>Project Objectives</h4><p>The size of the rescue device/robot that your team builds is limited such that it can be lifted and carried by one person. Dimensions of the device are limited to 0.25 m x 0.25 m x 0.25 m (10" x 10" x 10"). The webcam can extend beyond the dimensions if needed to ensure an unobstructed view. Each panel shown in the navigation course is generally 0.3 m x 0.3 m or 0.3 m x 0.6 m. The overall dimensions are 1.8 m x 1.8 m (6 feet x 6 feet). All dimensions are approximate and subject to change.</p><p>MTE 380 serves as an introduction to the application of computer vision. In the Milestone 1 workshops, you will learn how to use the provided vision module, and in this project you are expected to apply vision to:</p><ul><li><strong>Implement line tracking for your device to traverse the obstacle course using the vision module</strong></li><li>Detect safety zones for your device to drop your Lego-person</li><li>Optional: Object detection of a Lego-person</li></ul><h4>Project Constraints</h4><p>The device has to run autonomously through the S&amp;R course. The device is not permitted to leave the boundaries of the search and rescue site. The device is not permitted to climb over the walls. Flying devices are not permitted. LiDAR is not permitted. The device must adhere to the designated path; for instance, it is not allowed to take a shortcut by passing over the traps from the starting point to reach the bullseye target. Donations from any source must be cleared by the instructor or TAs. The objective is to prevent a team from obtaining an unfair advantage. What you purchase for your project is up to you subject to your budget.</p><p><strong>Prohibited Designs</strong></p><p>The following features are strictly prohibited in your designs:</p><ul><li>Projectiles of any means, including using the Lego-Person as a projectile.</li><li>Aerial devices.</li><li>Anything that can modify or destroy the obstacle course.</li><li>Devices that separate into multiple pieces.</li></ul><p>The teaching team reserves the rights to modify and append to this list of prohibited designs.</p><h4>The Competition</h4><p>The objective of the competition is for your device to navigate from the start of the S&amp;R course to the end of the course. The S&amp;R course may be reconfigured after each run. The S&amp;R operation will be timed. Each group will be given <strong>THREE</strong> attempts. An attempt is considered to be a run that lasts for more than 10 seconds or your devices passes the designated “attempted tile” (TBA). All group members are expected to be present during their group’s run.</p><p>For the Obstacle Course layout, please refer to the course outline posted on Learn, as images cannot be inserted on this platform.</p><h4>Successful Completion</h4><p>A successful completion is a run where your device is able to traverse the course, rescue the Lego person (pick-up and drop off at a designated safe-zone), and returns back to the start tile.</p><p> </p><h4>Marks</h4><p><strong>S&amp;R Course Navigation</strong></p><p>A total of 20 marks will be awarded for ability to successfully complete S&amp;R course navigation in any of your three allowed attempts.</p><h2>Performance Index</h2><p>The performance index will be used to calculate your device’s performance to determine the bonus marks on Game Day (please refer to the game day rubric).

enalties </h4><p>Two marks will be deducted from the 20 marks for ‘S&amp;R Course Navigation’ every time human assistance is required, and you will lose the successful attempt for that

It is the responsibility of students to review the student shop safety protocols found at: <a href="http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~engshop/Safety/protocols.html">http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~engshop/Safety/protocols.html.</a></p><p>Safety glasses, hand and foot protection, and ear protection must be worn when required.

For this reason, it is necessary to ask the</p><p>instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights and academic integrity.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.</p><p><strong>Continuity Plan - Fair Contingencies for Unforeseen Circumstances (e.g., resurgence of COVID-19): </strong>In the event of emergencies or highly unusual circumstances, the instructor will collaborate with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty. This may include modifying content delivery, course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines with due and fair notice to students. Substantial changes after the first week of classes require the approval of the Associate Dean, Undergraduate Studies.</p><p><strong>Declaring absences:</strong> [<i>undergraduate students and/or courses only</i>]  Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, students are responsible for reaching out to their instructors as soon as possible. The course instructor will determine how missed course components are accommodated.

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
