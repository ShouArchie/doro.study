<p><strong>Design Projects: </strong></p><p>There will be 2 projects with 2 reports</p><p>1. <u>Project 1 (individual project)</u>: load analysis and understanding solid models/drawings of machines</p><p>2. <u>Project 2 (in groups of two)</u>: a comprehensive design project</p><p>Guidelines on project report will be provided in as much detail as possible. However, design is an open problem (i.e. no unique solution). Therefore, other factors will affect your mark such as formality (professionalism) / efficiency (e.g. achieving the same goal with simpler design) / organization / cleanliness /aesthetics / writing quality of your designs &amp; reports (, which will be solely at the discretion of your instructor and TA’s). You will need to use Solidworks for projects. There is a student license available from University. Please check the announcement on course website for instruction to use Solidworks. To help those who are not familiar with Solidworks, two tutorial videos will be posted. Two Solidworks live sessions will also occur, with pointers on best practices for Project 1 and Project 2 respectively.</p><p>1. Solidworks 1 (Assembly): week 3 (tentative)</p><p>2. Solidworks 2 (Drawing): week 9 (tentative)</p><p><strong>Exam Policy:</strong> </p><p>Closed book and closed notes. No telecommunication devices are allowed to use during the exams.  Formula sheets have been provided for each chapter on Learn; students may choose to print and bring such to the exam; the instructor will not be responsible for providing the formula sheets to students. One calculator and one additional letter sized summary sheet (double-sided) are allowed.</p>

For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights and academic integrity.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.</p><p><strong>Continuity Plan - Fair Contingencies for Unforeseen Circumstances (e.g., resurgence of COVID-19): </strong>In the event of emergencies or highly unusual circumstances, the instructor will collaborate with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty. This may include modifying content delivery, course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines with due and fair notice to students. Substantial changes after the first week of classes require the approval of the Associate Dean, Undergraduate Studies.</p><p><strong>Declaring absences:</strong> [<i>undergraduate students and/or courses only</i>]  Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, students are responsible for reaching out to their instructors as soon as possible. The course instructor will determine how missed course components are accommodated. Self-declared absences (for COVID-19 and short-term absences up to 2 days) must be submitted through <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students"><u>Quest</u></a>. Absences requiring documentation (e.g., Verification of Illness Form, bereavement, etc.) are to be uploaded by completing the form on the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/"><u>VIF System</u></a>. The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services"><u>UWaterloo Verification of Illness form</u></a>, completed by a health professional, is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not send documentation to your advisor, course instructor, teaching assistant, or lab coordinator. Submission through the VIF System, once approved, will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Rescheduling Co-op Interviews: </strong>Follow the co-op process for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts"><u>rescheduling co-op interviews</u></a> for conflicts to graded assignments (e.g., midterms, tests, and final exams).
