<p>MTE 119 provides a basic understanding of the part of mechanics which is concerned with the equilibrium of bodies under the action of forces. It lays the foundation and framework for subsequent courses, namely Dynamics (SYDE 182) and Mechanics of Deformable Solids (MTE 219). Topics covered include basic concepts of mechanics and vectors, Free-Body diagrams and equilibrium of particles, Free-Body diagrams and equilibrium of rigid bodies, force systems, analysis of trusses, beams and frames, distributed forces, centroids and moments of inertia, internal shear and bending moments in beams, friction and application of frictional forces.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Course Structure:</u></strong></p><p><strong>Lectures:</strong> Lectures will be held on Tuesday and Thursday from 10:00-11:20am EST. Lectures will take place in the STC0040 lecture hall. There are three make-up lecture dates noted above (note different room location). Lectures will introduce the textbook material being covered in the course along with corresponding solutions to example problems. Attendance and participation during lectures are expected for learning and skill development. Lecture notes will be made available through Learn, but lectures will not be recorded or streamed. </p><p><strong>Tutorials: </strong>Tutorials are used to help you apply the concepts learned in class to the solution of typical statics problems. Tutorials will be held on Wednesdays or Fridays from 10:30-11:20pm EST based on the different class section in which you are assigned. Problems solved are similar to assigned problem set questions and test problems. </p><p><strong>Weekly Problem Sets: </strong>A selection of problem set questions from the course textbook will be posted each week. The problem set assignments will not be marked; however, solutions will be posted on LEARN the following week. These problem sets are valuable study aids and are good examples of possible exam-type questions. Weekly completion will also help with pacing of the course. If you are struggling with a problem set, please seek help from a peer, TA, first year tutor or the instructor.</p><p><strong>Weekly Checklist: </strong>A checklist will be posted in Learn each week that indicates the course material being covered and expected progress each week.</p>

<p><strong><u>Course Deliverables</u></strong></p><p><strong><u>1. Design Project (10%): </u></strong></p><p>There will be a design project worth 10% of your final grade in the course. This is a group projects (2-3 students). Groups are self-selected. Any material taken from other refereed sources such as text books, handbooks, or journal articles must be properly referenced. Submissions that contain unreferenced copied or plagiarized material from other student reports or other external sources is considered an academic offence. </p><p> </p><p><strong><u>2. Tests (45% = 3 x 15%):</u></strong></p><p>There will be three (3) <u>in-class</u> tests (75 minutes) spread throughout the term. Each test is worth 15% of your final grade in this course. <strong><u>Tests are considered closed book</u></strong>. Further details on the tests will be provided on Learn. </p><p><i><strong>Test 1:</strong></i> January 23, 10:00-11:15am EST in STC0040</p><p><i><strong>Test 2:</strong></i> February 13, 10:00-11:15am EST in STC0040</p><p><i><strong>Test 3:</strong></i> March 20, 10:00-11:15am EST in STC0040</p><p><strong>Missing a test</strong></p><p>Missing a test due to illness will result in the weight of the test being shifted to the final exam, provided that illness has been self-declared on Quest and you have notified the First Year Engineering Office and the course instructor. If the illness is not declared or if the explanation is not deemed acceptable, a grade of 0 will be assigned as the test grade. The weight of the examination will not be changed under any other circumstances. Self-declaration of illness forms must be submitted within 48 hours in accordance with university policy. </p><p>Outside of a self-declared illness, it is your responsibility to attend and complete the test during the assigned test period. <u>There will be no accommodations for conflicts with other activities such as co-op interviews.</u></p><p> </p><p><strong><u>3. Final Exam (45%):</u></strong></p><p>The final exam will be held in person. It is a 2.5 hours, cumulative, closed-book and closed-notes exam. Allowed materials are pen, pencil, eraser, sharpener and scientific calculator. No assignments or any other papers are allowed (blank sheets will be provided). No telecommunication devices will be permitted to be used during the exam (e.g., cell phones, wireless devices, etc). </p><p><strong>Missing the Final Exam</strong></p><p>Missing the final exam due to illness will result in an assigned grade of INC (Incomplete) provided that illness is self-declared on Quest and you have notified the First Year Engineering Office and the course instructor. The grade of INC (Incomplete) will be resolved by a deferred exam within 4 months of the end of the course.  If no deferred exam is written within that timeframe, the grade will be converted to FTC (Failure to Complete).  If the illness cannot be verified or if the explanation is not deemed acceptable, a grade of DNW (Did Not Write) will be submitted for the student.<strong> If you self-declare illness, you must not access the exam paper. If you do, you will receive a grade of 0 on the exam. If you become ill during the exam, notify the instructor immediately.</strong></p><p>Every effort will be made to provide a makeup exam on the last day of exams for students that are verifiably ill during the scheduled final exam slot.  If you are ill and unable to write the final exam as scheduled, you are expected to be available for the makeup exam.  <i>The timing of this makeup exam will be determined once it is known which other exams on that date are to be written by the students who were ill.</i></p>

Do not send documentation to your advisor, course instructor, teaching assistant, or lab coordinator. Submission through the VIF System, once approved, will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Rescheduling Co-op Interviews: </strong>Follow the co-op process for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts"><u>rescheduling co-op interviews</u></a> for conflicts to graded assignments (e.g., midterms, tests, and final exams). Attendance at co-operative work-term employment interviews is not considered to be a valid reason to miss a test.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as the use of statics principles in a practical design project. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
