<p><u>LABORATORY WORK:</u></p><p>Detailed instructions for the laboratory sessions are included in lab-manual which can be downloaded from the course account on LEARN. Each student must choose a group and sign up for the lab schedule.</p><p><i>You will save much time</i> if you thoroughly study the relevant sections of the lab- handout <i>before</i> attempting the experiments in the lab. Come to the lab. with a clear understanding of what you are meant to accomplish, or with clear questions, so that the Teaching Fellows can help you.</p><p><strong>Lab marks and mark adjustments if you miss a lab session or a deadline:</strong></p><ul><li>There are 5 lab modules, which together constitute 20% of your final grade. </li><li>All submissions are to be done electronically, through the LEARN system </li><li>Prelabs and lab reports are due as specified in the Lab Calendar posted on LEARN.  Please verify that you have uploaded your submission on time, the document is complete, and it is under the group account of the correct course number.</li><li>Pre-labs will not be graded, but they are mandatory to attend the lab. Late pre-labs are not permitted. </li><li>Late lab reports will incur a penalty of 20% in the first 24 hours, and 100% thereafter, unless prior arrangements are made or a valid reason presented within a week from the missed deadline.  In no case will a lab report be accepted more than a week past the deadline; if a valid reason exists for being unable to hand in the lab within the week following the deadline, then the lab will be assigned a weight of zero and the remaining labs will be reweighted accordingly.</li><li>Lab attendance is mandatory for each student. Missing a significant portion of a lab session without a valid reason will result in a reduction in the lab report grade (for that student only). The grade reduction will be proportional to the fraction of the lab session missed, where missing an entire lab session (without a valid reason) results in a 100% reduction in the lab report grade. In cases where a student misses part of a lab session, the lab instructor is the one who determines the mark reduction. </li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Note:  A Student must attend all lab’s. If the student fails to attend any of the five labs, they will automatically be receiving an NCR (no credit generated) for his final grade.</strong></p><p> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
