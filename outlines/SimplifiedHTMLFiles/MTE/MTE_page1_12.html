<p><strong>Exams: </strong>Exams are closed book with an equation sheet permitted. </p><p><strong>Labs: </strong>Lab exercise #1 will be assigned during the second week of the term to demonstrate data collection and analysis concepts from the course material. The lab will be completed on your own without supervision. Students will work in groups of two, collecting data and performing a statistical analysis for a physical quantity of their choosing. Measurement resources and assistance are available at WATiMake, the MME Clinic in DWE 3508/3509. The lab will include a written report completed as a group and a penalty of 10% per day will be deducted from the final grade for late submissions. Lab exercise #2 will be conducted during Weeks 12 and 13. The lab will be completed on your own without supervision. The recommended location for the lab is the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 2<sup>nd</sup> floor stairs in E5 or E7, but the measurements can be performed from any elevated location. Students must observe safety rules and regulations while working in labs and fabrication spaces, in accordance with departmental health and safety rules and regulations.  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/undergraduate-students/health-and-safety-training">https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/undergraduate-students/health-and-safety-training</a> </p><p><strong>Project:</strong> A group project will be assigned during Week 6 to design, build, calibrate and demonstrate a device to perform a simple measurement, such as distance, pressure, or temperature. WATiMake, the MME Clinic in DWE 3508/3509 is available during weeks 9 – 10 for students to work on their projects. The project will include a written report and short presentation / demonstration, both of which will be completed as a group.  The demonstrations will be held during Week 11, March 18 - 21 from 8:30 – 11:30am. A penalty of 10% per day will be deducted from the final grade for late submissions.</p><p><strong>Problems: </strong>Problem sets and solutions are posted on the course website. Students are expected to work independently on these problem sets according to the course schedule and check their work using the solutions provided. </p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Recommendations for how to cite GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
