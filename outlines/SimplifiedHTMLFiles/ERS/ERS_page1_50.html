<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ERS 702:</div>
<p>Examination of the process leading from design of critical transdisciplinary research to publication of findings and other outreach to the broader community.  The course will include examination of doctoral research design in ERS, the nature of potential findings and means of dissemination of findings, including the diverse academic literature in environmental studies.</p>

<p>The PhD in Social and Ecological Sustainability provides advanced, transdisciplinary training for students who are pursuing diverse careers in the public, private and non-profit sectors, including academia. The program offers enormous flexibility to support these diverse career paths. However, at its heart it remains an advanced academic degree where students are expected to make a significant, original contribution to knowledge through research. </p><p>This course helps students lay the foundation for their doctoral studies in the PhD in Social and Ecological Sustainability. Some of the topics we’ll explore are designed to help students successfully navigate the requirements of PhD studies, notably the comprehensive examination. Others are designed to help students clarify and focus their research interests. </p><p><strong>Approach: </strong>Learning in this course will occur through a combination of self-study, focused discussions during class sessions, peer learning through workshops, a critical writing assignment, and the creation of a Research Profile. All parts of the course – class sessions, workshops, assignments, readings – are designed to work together, and to support your personal research and learning objectives.</p><p>Many class sessions will involve structured dialogues organized around key questions and related readings. You’ll prepare for these sessions by reading assigned material, and by finding your own related material. <i>Ultimately, the value of discussions during class session will be determined by the extent to which you have prepared yourself, and by the quality of your contributions during class</i>. We’ll also use several class sessions to workshop and brainstorm around key topics relating to your work. These sessions facilitate considerable peer-to-peer learning.</p><p>The Research Profile assignment (see below) is the vehicle through which you will develop and solidify your academic interests, while simultaneously defining the scope of your comprehensive examination. The related Research Foundations paper complements the Research Profile and gives you an opportunity to dig deeply into your interests.</p>

<p>The grade you receive in the course will be based on the quality and depth of your engagement with the themes we’re addressing, and the quality of the work that you submit (written assignments, presentations, etc.).</p><p><strong>Research Profile: </strong>The written and oral components of the Comprehensive Examination for the PhD in Social and Ecological Sustainability normally must be completed before the end of the 16<sup>th</sup> month of your program. One of the requirements of the Comprehensive Examination process is the preparation of a “Research Profile”. Through a series of sub-components that build on each other you will produce a Research Profile in ERS 702 that serves as a first draft of the one you’ll prepare as part of your Comprehensive Examination. See the separate handout on the course website, titled <i>Instructions for Research Profile Assignment</i>. </p><p>Ideally the questions you will be asked to address during the Comprehensive Examination will relate directly to the themes and literature you mapped out in your final Research Profile. Therefore, you should view this assignment as being much more than a course requirement; <i>through the Research Profile assignment you are laying the foundation for your doctoral program</i></p><p><strong>Research Foundations Paper:</strong> In undertaking transdisciplinary research it’s usually the case that we have to integrate foundational concepts from diverse fields and disciplines. You may even be drawing on quite different sources of knowledge and ways of knowing. Your Research Profile will identify foundational building blocks from the literature in broad terms. However, the Research Profile document does not provide space for you to delve deeply into theoretical and conceptual issues surrounding the building blocks, or to explore whether or not and how they can be assembled into a coherent framework you can use to undertake your research. </p><p>Through the Research Foundations paper, you’ll have an opportunity to fill this gap. Importantly, your Research Foundations paper directly support your Research Profile, and vice versa. Therefore, you should view the two assignments as linked and complementary.  See the separate handout on the course website, titled <i>Instructions for Research Foundations Paper</i>.</p><p><strong>Presentation Linked to Theme Section:</strong> Four of the class periods are used for “theme sessions” during which we will explore foundational topics such as transdisciplinarity and knowledge mobilization. During each of these sessions, students will deliver short presentations that provide a focus for the class discussions. See the separate handout on the course website, titled <i>Instructions for Theme Sessions for Presenters and Participants</i>. Depending on enrolment, presentations may be individual or by teams. Each person or team will deliver <i>one</i> of these presentations during the term. I will assign presentation topics and time slots. The <i>Schedule of Classes, Topics, and Assignment Due Dates</i> (available on the course website) lists the overall theme session topics and due dates.</p><p><strong>Peer Feedback and Class Contributions: </strong>The quality of your contributions during class sessions, and the feedback you provide to your peers during workshop sessions, will provide the basis for your peer feedback and class contributions grade. This part of your overall grade speaks to the importance of constructive participation and engagement with your peers during the course. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Basic Expectations -</strong> Our basic expectations are as follows:</p><ul><li>During class sessions, you participate effectively, respectfully and constructively. You use your phone and computer only for class-related activities such as note taking</li><li>Your responses to other peoples’ ideas are critical and specific, but fair. At the same time, you accept fair but specific critical feedback in the spirit in which it is offered</li><li>Your written work is well organized, free of grammar, spelling and style issues, and properly supported with relevant literature; you follow the instructions</li><li>Your arguments are thoughtful, insightful and well-grounded in relevant literature and theory</li><li>Rather than simply relying on resources that have been provided to you, or on material with which you already are familiar, you read widely in new areas. This allows you to bring new ideas and perspectives to the table</li><li>Work you complete is submitted on time, and you are always well prepared for class</li><li>You understand the University of Waterloo’s high standards of integrity and ethics, and you meet or exceed them at all times</li></ul><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><p><strong>Consultation:</strong> I’ve identified the day of class as my “office day” for this course. It’s always best to make an appointment to ensure I’ll be available when you’d like to chat. On the remaining days of the week, I’m going to be busy with administrative tasks, course preparation and marking, other classes, research projects, graduate student supervision, writing, scheduled appointments and other tasks. Please try to see me on my scheduled office day – but if it’s an emergency I will try to accommodate you. If you need to talk to me outside of my scheduled office hours, I’m always happy to make an appointment. </p><p><strong>Email Policy:</strong> Email is an excellent way to contact me about straightforward problems and questions. I will respond to your emails as promptly as possible. However, I get a lot of emails so it may take me a day or two to reply to your message. I will use your uwaterloo.ca account to send messages to you, so make sure that you check it regularly. If you use another service (e.g., Gmail), then make sure that you are forwarding messages sent to your uwaterloo.ca email account. </p><p><strong>Course Website:</strong> This course makes extensive use of the University of Waterloo’s courseware system. The course web site (<a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/">https://learn.uwaterloo.ca</a>) contains the following material: </p><ul><li>Schedules of dates (topics, assignment due dates, readings)</li><li>Instructions and handouts</li><li>Week-by-week overviews of each course, including the theme, key questions, links to readings, and instructions for assignments</li><li>Discussion forums and drop boxes</li><li>Announcements</li></ul><p><i>It is your responsibility to learn how to use the course web site and other services we will use (e.g., Teams, Zoom, WebEx), and to check the website regularly for information and updates.</i></p><p><strong>When You Cannot Meet a Course Requirement for Illness or Other Reasons:</strong><i><strong> </strong></i>If you find yourself unable to meet a course requirement because of medical, compassionate or other reasons, then please advise me as soon as possible. Contact me in advance, but otherwise let me know as soon as you can that you need special consideration. Email is fine. There’s a lot to do in this course, and your colleagues are depending on you to carry your share of the load during class time. If you’re not prepared, then everyone’s learning suffers. Therefore, please manage your time carefully, and remember that <i>pressure of work alone is not an acceptable reason for lack of preparedness</i>. </p><p><i>Remember that attendance in class and full participation in discussions is a course requirement!</i></p><p><strong>Assignment Submission and Late Penalty:</strong><i> </i>Assignments must be submitted through the course web site by the time and date specified in the instructions for that assignment. I will not accept assignments submitted any other way, e.g., in hard copy, or sent as email attachments. Unless I have indicated otherwise, I will accept late assignments. If you’re late because of illness or other emergency that we’ve discussed, then there won’t be a penalty. Otherwise, in fairness to your peers, I will apply a late penalty of 5% per day. After 5 days I won’t accept late assignments unless we have a prior arrangement.</p><p><strong>Group Work and Collaboration:</strong> Discussing assignments with your colleagues is an excellent way to learn from your peers and to test your ideas. I strongly encourage you to brainstorm, share ideas, review drafts of assignments, etc. However, ultimately work that you turn in has to be the product of your own efforts unless the instructions specifically indicate otherwise.</p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>.
