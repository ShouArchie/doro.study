  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ERS 681:</div>
<p>The course examines how societies can respond in practical ways to complexity, change and uncertainty, Social and ecological theory is blended with examples of applications and strategies (local/global) to support management and governance in social-ecological systems.  Emphasis is placed on how individuals and societies can transcend disciplinary thinking to build our capacity to foster sustainability.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>This course focuses on how your own work is (or can be) situated in the broader social and ecological sustainability context. Our approach to ‘Sustainability Applications’ will be: 1) systemic - thinking in terms of social and ecological connections and considering feedback across scales; 2) critical - not accepting the obvious explanation and challenging the relationships of power that influence sustainable outcomes (generally and in regards to your own focus); and 3) applied – developing and using concepts, tools and skills in the context of some real-world challenges, with an emphasis on your own areas of application through the development of your research proposal and/or thesis ideas. </p><p>The course is organized as a seminar. Students will be expected to take an active role in discussing assigned readings, presenting their research ideas, and giving constructive feedback. This course serves as a platform for you to further develop parts of your research proposal and other key components of your thesis (research questions, literature review, research framework, etc.), and to consider some new ideas and ways of approaching the linked social-ecological challenges in which we are embedded. This course builds on material covered in ERS 680, and the thesis components will complement the advice and instructions you will receive from your advisor. </p>

<p><i>Classs Attendance and Participation</i></p><p>This is not a lecture course where you can participate passively. In some sessions, I or a guest will deliver some material using a lecture format, but for the most part the course involves active discussion and dialogue. The quality and depth of our conversations, and thus the learning, depends very much on how prepared students are. Therefore, the grade assigned for this component is not based simply on attendance. Being physically present in class is the bare minimum expectation. You need to arrive at each class prepared and ready to engage. In general, this means that you will have completed any required readings and preparatory exercises, and will be ready to offer your perspectives and debate and discuss ideas constructively and respectfully with colleagues. </p><p><i>Literature review </i></p><p>Your literature review grounds your work in published research relating to your topic. Lit reviews normally provide the intellectual foundation for a research area/issue—identifying areas in scholarship where consensus exist, and where there might be disagreement or knowledge is still unclear. Your literature review also identifies gaps in the literature, and how you your research will contribute to addressing such gaps. </p><p><i>Research framework and methodology</i></p><p>Your research framework justifies your study and explains its structure and design (see Biggs et al. 2021 on conceptual framework and research methods).  I will guide you as you develop these sections, but you will need to engage your advisor to make sure you are on the right track. </p><p><i>Proposal development</i></p><p>Your proposal development will outline your research project based on the material you have written and the feedback received from previous components. You are free to recycle as much of the text from previous submissions as you wish, however, the finished product must read like one document. The grade breakdown for this component is 15 % for your proposal development, and 5 % for sourcing your own readings (for 6 themes between weeks 2-10). The quality of these must be appropriate for each theme.</p>

Intellectual property includes items such as: Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof); Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides); Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments); and work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor orTA with permission of the copyright owner).</p><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectualproperty rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor(s), and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository). Permission from an instructor, or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation ofintellectual property rights. Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills in sustainability research. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.
