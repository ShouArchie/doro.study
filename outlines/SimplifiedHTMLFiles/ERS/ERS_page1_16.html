<p>This course introduces the main concepts and principles of wildlife ecology. Topics covered include: population dynamics, animal behavior, habitats, genetics, predation, and habitat use. The lab component will introduce students to wildlife data collection, analysis, and interpretation.</p><p>Course Goals: This course will provide an introduction to the main concepts and principles of wildlife ecology and management. Modern approaches to wildlife management and conservation often require the use sophisticated quantitative methods. This is not a statistics course; however, students will be introduced to the basic principles of quantitative ecology including study design, data collection and analysis, and simulation modeling. Understanding these basic quantitative principles will help students determine the reliability and quality of the information provided by researchers. Students will have the opportunity to explore data and model development through the lab component of the course. R is a powerful and flexible statistical software that we will use throughout the course to better understand the principles presented in lecture. Students will also collect field data on the local wildlife populations around the University of Waterloo and will develop models in lab to better understand the space use patterns of these species. Overall, it is my goal to provide you some tools to think clearly and critically about wildlife research and provide the basics for understanding the biology and ecology of a suite of taxa including birds, mammals, and herpetofauna. I also want to provide you with working knowledge of R programming language and an introduction to the use and power of this tool. Computer programming is an important skill for modern ecologists. This course will provide an introduction.</p>

<p><strong>Lab Component:</strong> The course has a mandatory lab that meets weekly. Space in the computer labs, when we are on campus, is limited so you should only attend your assigned lab section. Attendance at the lab is highly recommended. Each week, we will work through a set of exercises. A short assignment is associated with most of the lab sessions. The lab sessions will focus on introducing the students to R software, programming, and data analysis. Students are strongly encouraged to review the lab material in the lab manual prior to attending the weekly lab sessions. All of the information required to complete the weekly lab assignments is contained within the lab manual.</p><p><strong>Assignments: </strong>There are a suite of assignments associated with the lab component of this course. Lab sessions are typically spread across two weeks. These assignments are short, so do not let the number of them worry you. There is one major assignment due throughout the course that will rely on the basis of analysis that we develop throughout. More details on the assignment will be provided during the course; however, they are briefly outlined here.</p><p><strong>Matrix Population Modeling: </strong>For this assignment we will use simulated data to understand how wildlife populations change and what features of animal life history have the greatest influence on fluctuations in population numbers. I will provide more details on this assignment as the course progresses.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Late Policy and Extensions: </strong>Assignments will be assigned a late penalty of 10% per day up until 5 days after which assignments will not be accepted. The midterm and final examinations will not be accepted late and must be completed within the allotted time window of 24 hours. Students are expected to have access to a functioning computer that can access LEARN and run the most current version of R statistical software and RStudio. Remote access to UW computers (all of which have R and RStudio installed) can be arranged through the Faculty of Environment's Computer support group: Mapping Analysis and Design (MAD). There are six lab modules and one final group assignment. Any exceptions to the late policy outlined above will only be accommodated for documented medical reasons.</p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof)</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides)</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams)</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner)</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository). Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights. Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Mental Health: </strong>The University of Waterloo, the Faculty of Environment and our Departments/Schools consider students' well-being to be extremely important. We recognize that throughout the term students may face health challenges - physical and/or emotional. Please note that help is available. Mental health is a serious issue for everyone and can affect your ability to do your best work. Counselling Services - <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/counselling-services">http://www.uwaterloo.ca/counselling-services</a> is an inclusive, nonjudgmental, and confidential space for anyone to seek support. They offer confidential counselling for a variety of areas including anxiety, stress management, depression, grief, substance use, sexuality, relationship issues, and much more.</p><p><strong>Religious Observances:</strong> Students need to inform the instructor at the beginning of term if special accommodation needs to be made for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and assignments.</p><p><strong>Unclaimed assignments</strong>: Unclaimed assignments will be retained until one month after term grades become official in quest. After that time, they will be destroyed in compliance with UW’s confidential shredding procedures.</p><p><strong>Communications with Instructor: </strong>All communication with students must be through either the student’s University of Waterloo email account or via Learn. If a student emails the instructor or TA from a personal account they will be requested to resend the email using their personal University of Waterloo email account. </p><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills.

To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
