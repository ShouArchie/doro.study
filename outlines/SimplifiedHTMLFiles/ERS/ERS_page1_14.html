  Course Description

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ERS 337:</div>
<p>Focus is on restoration and conservation at landscape scale, including an emphasis on connectivity, reintroduction of keystone species, novel ecosystems, re-introduction of apex predators, herbivores, and omnivores. Because ReWilding can be infused with various political agendas and ideologies, technocratic issues, policy ambitions, and governance issues, students can expect to experience a course focused on ecology and technical skills but contextualized and connected to the larger concepts of socioecological change and resilience. There may be opportunities for field experiences.</p>

<p>There are a lot of conflicting definitions, but my perspective is that much of the ecological practice and research of <strong>rewilding</strong> is the macro-scale approach to <strong>restoring</strong> the socioecological resilience of ecosystems; I consider it a subset of ecological restoration though I’ve offset the terms in this course with the conjunction “and” so one might consider them to be two aspects of the milieu of <i>restoration ecology</i> as a conceptual and theoretical framework. Not everyone agrees as we shall discover in this course - not even my many friends in this domain of research and practice.  For those who don't know me yet, I've been an ecologist and, specifically, a restoration ecologist for a long time and have taught a lot of students (about 600 alumni from my courses or supervision are working as restoration ecologists today). I've worked from local to international (United Nations) level on a lot of different ecosystems around the world - everywhere except Antarctica. This does not make me infallible, sadly. It does mean you're being taught restoration and rewilding by someone who has the chops to be legit, if not always right. My word is not law. Pity. I'd like to be the restoration king. I'm more of a restoration knave.</p><p>Some of my thoughts are here: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/environment-resources-and-sustainability/blog/you-break-it-we-fix-it">https://uwaterloo.ca/environment-resources-and-sustainability/blog/you-break-it-we-fix-it</a>. </p><p>Rewilding often is spatially explicit (e.g. how organisms move through space) and focuses on large scales, but it can take a more integrative approach that is more geared towards ecological planning, management, and monitoring of the whole socioecological system. Consistent with the mission of the School of Environment, Resources &amp; Sustainability, this course will explore the full range of facets that Rewilding &amp; Ecological Restoration involves.  The course will have some focus on spatially explicit rewilding and restoration because this is a major focus of the discipline in general. Because Rewilding &amp; Ecological Restoration can be infused with various political agendas and ideologies, technocratic issues, policy ambitions, and governance issues, students can expect to experience a course focused on ecology and technical skills but contextualized and connected to the larger concepts of socioecological change and resilience.  </p>

<p><strong>For due dates and times for all tests and/or assignments, consult the Dropbox folder on LEARN where these are displayed. </strong>This reduces potential conflicting information between this Outline and LEARN instructions. Focus on this: If you make your own notes synthesizing course lessons every week and consult the instructions and expectations for applying course lessons to assignments and/or tests from the <u>very start of term</u>, your life will be much easier and you will be much more successful in this course and in life in general. There are PRACTICE and/or guiding examples of assignments and/or tests in the LEARN folders at the very top of the Contents.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What is the purpose of learning and assessment in the courses I teach? </strong>This seems like a silly question but it is not. We all spend about 15 years sprinting from task to task without thinking about what we are learning and why. Hence, I am putting this text in every course I teach to ensure you think about it all. My job is to teach you almost every major skill and theme that exists within a course’s scope and domain. My job is to assess if you’ve made the progress expected as a scholar and a professional. My job is to avoid cornering you on trivial details or compressing your experience into a series of soon-to-be-forgotten nightmares of memorizing factoids or math equations. I want you to know what professionals use to understand the world around us, the specific skills needed in a domain of knowledge and work, how to choose the right analytical tools, when to use the right analytical tools and how to use those analytical tools to solve difficult and important problems. I want you to be able to write professionally, regardless of whatever a course uses as its vehicles (e.g. test, assignment, project). I want you to be able efficiently find, and effectively use and critique peer reviewed literature (academic journals and professional venues) and apply it to new problems to solve. In short, I want you learn as much as there is to learn at your current stage of scholarly and professional development.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Details on the assessment of students in this course.</strong></p><p><br/><strong>Task 1. Mid-course take-home test.</strong> This take-home test serves to examine how well I’ve taught the class and how well you’ve understood the material during about 50% of the course that we have completed. It will focus on asking you to start with syntheses of the various topics covered in class up until Winter Study Week and then to ask you to reflect and comment, offering your insights. It is also useful preparation for the take-home case study during the exam period because it requires you to grapple with the bulk of the course’s skills and techniques that will be applied in the later case response (see below). There will be choices in the questions I ask. You have a LOT of time to complete what is the equivalent to a 90 minute test, it is open book. Typically, a well written and concise answer to a 20 mark question consumes about 1000-1750 words and about 700-1000 words for a 10 mark question.  I normally give you some choices in the questions to be answered and usually have 2 x 20 mark questions and 3 x 10 mark questions that you answer (again, with some choices - so more than 5 questions will appear on the test document). <strong>Reminder: Due date and time is shown on the Dropbox folder on LEARN.</strong><br/> </p><p><i>The grading rubric is:</i></p><ul><li>10% is allocated to your ability to focus on the most important issues and write concisely</li><li>10% is allocated to your style and professionalism</li><li>80% is allocated to the depth, quality and knowledge of details in your answer</li></ul><p><br/> </p><p><strong>Task 2. Case response (take-home exercise during the Final Exam Period).</strong>  I devise a case-based scenario that will require you to respond to it with a rewilding and ecological restoration plan.  It will be based on real world issues and have elements of things that actually have happened; however, in order for you to have the opportunity to innovate a bit, it will not be based on one that has been resolved or studied in depth. It will require you to draw on the materials for the entire course but you have choice and leeway on what you wish to focus upon – there will not be a sole ‘correct’ answer that I am looking for as it is about your ability to synthesize and give insight into a rewilding and restoration need. It tests your ability to apply the conceptual, theoretical, and methodological frameworks to a new problem and to explore some of the applicable techniques we have studied. </p><p>I will grade the plan on how you focus on the problem, your knowledge of the topic (based on the course, naturally), the analytical basis of your proposal, the details provided to achieve the plan, and feasibility of the plan provided. This means you should be prepared – and able – to provide a theoretical and conceptual framework to address the question being asked of you, a research design and plan to address the question, some notions of how data should be analyzed, and commentary on likely outcomes and, again, how these outcomes address the question. This is open book and I will allocate far more time than you actually will need – it will be open well before the exam period and will anticipate you spending about 3 hours writing it if you have kept up with the course, though many of you will use the extra time to flesh out your response. <strong>Reminder: Due date and time is shown on the Dropbox folder on LEARN.</strong><br/><br/>The grading rubric is:</p><ul><li>10% is allocated to your ability to focus on the most important issues and write concisely</li><li>10% is allocated to your style and professionalism; how well do you write under some pressures of time</li><li>60% is allocated to the depth, quality and knowledge of details covered in your action plan</li><li>20% is allocated to the feasibility, quality and ability to link to evidence provided in the key recommendations in your action plan</li></ul><p>The spirit of what I want to read from your case response is consistent with what I outlined for the take-home test, mid-course. The two tasks differ because one is a call and answer response to specific questions and the other is a creative and technical design. However, the type of approach needed to succeed at a high level is similar in both tasks. </p><p> </p><p><strong>How do I assess quality in grading your tasks?</strong></p><p>“Life is all essays; it is not multiple-choice; life is nuance, sophistication, thoughtfulness, and clarity that intersect with evidence and analysis”</p><p>Tests, case responses, and any student assessment task tries to gauge your ability to provide insight into the issues in the course, starting (but not ending) with the source material (readings/lessons). You are meant to reflect, critique, think, articulate your ideas, and propose workable approaches at a level commensurate with an upper year course. I do not expect PhD level answers to attain a great grade and you are not expected to match the level of the authors of our readings in the sense that they all have at least 10 years more experience and years to do research and write. I’m looking for you to convince me you have thought about the ideas in class so far – and we’re only a few weeks along in the course – and want to see how you handle the lessons and offer insight. It is open-ended but so is life and your insight built upon a body of knowledge is what makes you able to graduate and get paid. You’re not making widgets or parroting others; you build your ideas from a body of work and articulate them, showing us what you have to offer.  The assessment below reflects this.</p><ul><li><strong>80-100 (A): </strong>Your work addresses the fundamental issues related to the questions and provides a useful and concise synthesis of them. The upper end of this range means that you have taken reasonably intense efforts at going beyond the materials provided, insights covered in class, or the literature assigned. Your answer provides depth to convince the reader that you have great insight into the issues or the technical knowledge to produce an operational solution, reflection, synthesis and/or analysis (some or all of these may be relevant depending on the focus and scope of the questions). Relevant to most situations, it means you have used the comparative peer reviewed literature properly.  On tests, this means drawing on the insights from class lessons where we used peer reviewed literature to provide evidence to support our discussions.<br/><br/>On novel tasks/questions within tests or, more commonly, on assignments, you have sought a good body of comparative peer reviewed literature and applied it. Depending on the nature of an assignment, the peer reviewed literature can provide a conceptual and theoretical framework in an introduction, used to devise a strong set of methods, and/or used to provide insight and likely explanations for why we found certain results in experimental studies or why we should use those ideas in exercises like planning protected areas or new approaches to some socioecological endeavour (e.g. analysis of resource use, planning protected areas, devising new ways to implement ecological restoration). The specific applications vary depending on the subject material and tasks in each course you take. <br/><br/>The important thing to focus upon is that in order to be comparative and useful, peer reviewed literature does NOT necessarily have to be anchored in the same geographical location or exact same type of ecological, social, or socioecological system that you are working within. Now this does depend on what you want to use it for but generally as long as there are sufficient similarities in the types of questions being addressed, the geographic location is less important. Again, this can vary. If your topic is very narrow and depends on a unique set of ecological and social conditions, then the comparative literature has to be used carefully and account for different situations. For example, designing a protected area to conserve a population of mosses in northern Quebec will be different than designing a protected area to promote habitat connectivity and movement of elephants in South Africa. There would be relevant literature that applies to both, e.g. how do we generally work with stakeholders, but the specific ecological mechanisms would differ. <br/><br/>See any peer reviewed research study to see how they use peer reviewed literature in the Introduction and Discussion sections or, for assignments/tests not structured this way, how any peer reviewed paper uses peer literature overall.<br/> </li><li><strong>70-79 (B):</strong><i> </i>Your work shows that you have most of the elements and knowledge related to answering the questions. On the lower end of this range, the text and answer itself is a bit muddled or disorganized; on the upper end of this range, this is less of an issue. Answers receiving the lower end of this grade range normally are ones that reflect a more superficial understanding of the issues related to the answer or are not as well written. Usually, this grade range reflects a good understanding of the ideas but not as much insight as would be found in an A level grade. Typically, those who earn in the B range are better at <i>synthesis</i> of ideas than at <i>analysis</i> and applying what we learn in class to solving specific problems.<br/> </li><li><strong>60-69 (C): </strong>You generally addressed the main requirements of the questions, but your answer shows less than rudimentary mastery of the basic materials and no real cohesion in your answer. Where relevant, it often indicates no serious engagement with the peer reviewed literature in any detail, i.e. you are normally expected to offer a synthesis of salient points and critique and explicate things like relevant social and/or ecological mechanisms that offer insight into our problem at hand.  It usually reflects some rather poor sentence structure, grammar, spelling, and/or organization.<br/> </li><li><strong>50-59 (D):</strong> Within this range, you provide enough insight to pass but not much more than that.  The upper end shows more effort and more promise, e.g. it might lack serious analysis but be written reasonably well<br/> </li><li><strong>Below 50 (F):</strong><i> </i>There is no sign of a serious effort to grapple with the questions. Usually this reflects some problem unrelated to the actual course material, so we work together to determine how to correct the deeper issues without intruding personally.</li></ul><p><br/><strong>What are the page limits/word count limits in the tasks?  </strong></p><p>These are the bane of my existence because they put people into the mindset of 'bean counting' rather than focusing on saying something useful and accurate (which is the whole point of writing), but I appreciate why students want them (and professionally, word limits do exist).  Again, the whole point of assessment is gauging the quality of your understanding and ability to answer questions. It is not about word limits.  So, any word or page limit I set in this course represent a decent set of <u>guidelines</u>  (<u>not strict rules</u>) as to how long your answer likely you should be, but it depends on your writing style - some people are very concise.  </p><p>Typically, a single page Word document wherein you use single spacing and a 12 pt font like Tahoma or Calibri represents about 500 words.  So if it is a 4000 word 'limit', then that is about 8 pages. Why single-spaced? Because it is no longer the year 1972 (when students used to double space because typewriters or handwritten documents needed to leave room for comments; nowadays, we have this marvellous thing called a "Word Processor" which magically allow us to submit e-documents rather than printing them and have marginal comment boxes).  </p><p>If you are obsessed with word counts in this course, you're focused on precisely the wrong thing and are not going to do a good job.  What I want you to focus on is to give me a good quality, intelligent, well evidenced, pragmatic, theoretically sound output. And, sure, the word limits do help you make sensible decisions, e.g. if it is 4000 words, then sending me a 1000 word piece is likely too shallow and poor and a 10,000 word piece is way too much and reflects excessive verbiage. <br/> </p><p><strong>How do you handle all the fine details on analytical methods (e.g. statistics, math formulae)?</strong><i> </i> Learning is not supposed to be annealed solely to you spewing back stuff on a task, like a sick parrot. While the test and case analysis tasks you complete for your course grade are reflective of the class material and fair extensions of what we emphasized, I don't test obscure and arcane things like, for example, the formula for a Monte Carlo test. I may present these in class so we learn how and why they work and why they are good approaches. </p><p>Not everything in a class lesson need be committed to memory nor repeated on a task. Learning is about exploring new ideas, understanding (not parroting) how to do things, learning new skills, overcoming fear of the unfamiliar, and becoming aware of all the possibilities and how they might work. This is not a course where I do something stupid like ask you to walk me through the steps of creating a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). If this were a stats course, maybe. But we want to learn how to use these weird sounding things with strange abbreviations as tools to make rewilding and restoration successful. </p><p>I want to show you how and why we use them. For an analogy: I don't want to teach you how to manufacture a Phillips screwdriver; I want to show you when you should use it, why you should use it, how you use it properly, and what options there are to assess whether it was the best too.  If you use Excel, for example, you only care about how to program the base spreadsheet code if you work for Microsoft; if you use Excel in your work, you don't care about any of that - you only care what Excel can be used for and how to use it properly.</p><p>For this course, I only assume you have experience with – and can recall – how basic statistics are used in environmental analyses, e.g., as in ENVS 178 or STAT 202.  If you have successfully completed some or all of more advanced courses, you may find the material in some of my courses a bit tame, but it is unlikely any of those courses used the same tools for the purpose of designing protected areas/parks. </p><p>The quantitative methods and analyses (for skill building) that I focus upon in ERS 337 are excellent complements to ERS 335 (where R is used for analyses of ecological restoration), ENVS 444 (where we apply methods for advanced analysis, planning, and assessment of protected areas), ERS 346 (where Python and/or R are used to analyze wildlife ecology), several of the GIS focused courses (especially in GEOG and PLAN) that teach basic to advanced spatial visualization and analysis, and courses across the University of Waterloo that focus on spatially explicit and multivariate analyses.  </p><p>Again, the point is not to try and force you to be experts in less than 12 weeks, because that cannot happen. The point is to ensure that you grasp the fundamentals, the scope, the possibilities, &amp; the opportunities that exist and how vast and interesting they can be.  </p><p> </p><p><strong>One piece of advice on writing style.</strong></p><p>Avoid rhetorical flourishes and extraneous connectives like "it must be understood that" or "Smith and Jones did a study in 2007 in Grenoble France that was really interesting".  Get to the point and save time, space, and reader sanity. The former connective is never needed; the latter sentence could be expressed better as "Smith and Jones (2007) found that..."</p><p> </p><p><strong>Submission deadlines, alternative grading paths, &amp; related policies.</strong></p><p>I tinker with this to hit the sweet spot of instilling professionalism and having compassion for students. One challenge that by this stage students are reflexively stuck on the notion of late penalties so this term I gave into that wall and put in some modest ones.  Here is this term’s set of policies for submission deadlines. I decided to try a policy that helps you if you are squeezed for time and rewards you if you meet the deadline.  </p><ul><li>Your work will be submitted online via LEARN. <strong>They are due on the date and time indicated on the Dropbox submission folders on LEARN. </strong>They will be graded and commented on using the track changes feature of MS Word, hence submit your work as a MS Word file or a format that is easily compatible - most word processing programs can save files as rich text format (.rtf). Call them surname_firstname_444X where X = 1,2, or 3. Don’t take this too literally; swap in your own name please.  Yes, people do forget to do that. It makes it hard to track whose assignment is whose. Life advice: Never add unnecessarily to workload for you or anyone else.<br/> </li><li>Any assignment or test submitted <strong>late but still within 21 days after the due date and time </strong>incurs a flat 5% reduction in the potential grade.<ul><li>That is a small penalty; it means the grade is lowered by about 1 increment (e.g. A to A-). If you are stressed or pressed for time, take the small penalty and submit when you can. The penalties do not increase any further with time.</li><li>If I had received official word from AccessAbility (they email me in confidence) about you needing alternative schemes, those will be followed (of course) and this reduction policy may not apply in this exact manner.<br/> </li></ul></li><li>Any assignment or test submitted <strong>late</strong> and <strong>more than 21 days after the due date and time</strong> incurs a flat 10% reduction in the potential grade. This includes those that are labelled as INComplete and/or are carried over into the following term until completed. This is a larger penalty designed for your to not procrastinate at submitting work that is increasingly overdue. Again, exceptions can be made under extenuating circumstances.<br/> </li><li>After about 10 working days, I have LEARN send out an email to everyone it detects as having not yet submitted. It will ask if you need help and to contact me. This gets repeated until we work out alternatives or you submit something. Again, the penalties are not being increased; I just need to make sure you are not in deep distress.<br/> </li><li>If you want your final grade to show on Quest on time at the end of the term, you have to submit all assignments by the due date and time of the final assignment in the course.  This is solely because I need time to grade, and the University requires I submit grades by a fixed date in order for them to show up on your Quest account.<br/> </li><li>If you do not submit assignments by the due date and time of the final assignment in the course, this creates potential issues – mainly relevant if and only if you plan to graduate after the end of this term.<ul><li>You should not divulge personal information to me. This is not because I do not care but because ethics and regulations protect your privacy. In communication, all I need to know is the depth to which you need help – not the details. Our communication would focus on getting the help you need.</li><li>Communication is vital. As you read the points below, make sure you commit to regular communication with me, whatever path we need to take. Do not forget this. If you do, the Registrar will have to make a decision in absence of communication from you and that often means you fail the course. We do not want that, especially if it is because you neglected to communicate with me regularly about your progress to competition or need for further help.</li><li>At the end of each term, I normally have obligations for research - this is 40% of a typical professor’s job; teaching courses is only 40% of it. While I will get all the on-time assignments done and grades submitted on time, late ones might not get done until after the Registrar’s Office deadline passes.</li><li>Anything after the due date and time risks me having to assign an INComplete.<ul><li>If a student can do all the assignments/tests but will need to spill into the next term, we normally negotiate a grade showing INComplete and establish a deadline, typically near the end of the following term.</li><li>Once submitted and graded, the INC changes into a formal numerical grade as usual.</li><li>If there are no other complications for a student (see below), this is the normal process and while it means you have an obligation to fulfill, it is a detour on the road in life.</li></ul></li><li>The issue is not that you have an INComplete – all that means is that I work with you and the Registrar to fix a deadline for later competition.  The issue is that you can’t graduate until it is done. If you are not planning to graduate after this term, it is much less of an issue.</li><li>There are some cases where an INComplete can interfere with course selection if this is a pre-requisite or if you need a full set of completed courses for a scholarship or job. These are rare but do be aware if this might affect you and work with me ahead of time to ensure we avoid problems.</li><li>DO NOT wait until the due date within the Final Exam period for the first time you contact me. I will respond but given I am also out on field research trips, I may not respond within the timeframe you need. If you work things out with me well beforehand, it makes your life easier.</li><li>If you suspect that you cannot hand in all the assignments, let us talk well in advance and come to an alternative. If you need help or some compassion, ask immediately. That's what I am here for. I know this is hard, especially asking an authority figure and/or a relative stranger. I can work out an alternative if it helps you succeed.<ul><li>Generally, if a student cannot complete all of the assignments in full, I'll rejig the course weighting for you and cap the final grade at 82% as the maximum you can earn - this represents a still creditable A-. 82% represents the historical median in most every course I ever teach.</li><li>This cap is to be fair to the others who do hand in all of the assigned tasks that I grade.</li><li>This cap is not sacrosanct because there are cases where a student is ill (e.g. COVID) or other issues, so any reweighting/rejigging is done on a personal and compassionate basis depending on your circumstances.<br/> </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>As most of you know, LEARN does have a gradebook feature that allows you to see the cumulative grade.  I caution that if we need to make accommodations to help you as a student, the gradebook won’t be the final authoritative record. For example, if life deals you a bad hand and you need me to drop a task or adjust task weights, LEARN's gradebook won't reflect that. Sometimes I will review the grading before submitting the final marks via QUEST and find you should have had a grade on an assignment that was a bit higher than originally recorded. LEARN also might slip its gears and add the grades wrong.  Basically, my job and obligation to you is to manually review everything before submitting grades to ensure you got the fairest and best possible outcome for all your hard work. The gradebook is a useful automated tool. My job as a professor and human being is to ensure the tool does not harm you. I am not of the mind that says we should automate the world. You are a person and each of you is treated as someone with rights and needs.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Do you want to succeed in life and in this course? Read this. Now.</strong></p><p><strong>Preparation</strong> is the key to success and creating superior performance on tests and assignments. Success is 90% perspiration via preparation and 10% inspiration.</p><ul><li>Read this Course Outline for the structure and intentions of the course, tests and assignment rationale &amp; structure, and course policies. Note that this is a boilerplate list. Not all of my courses have both tests and assignments.</li><li>Do some ‘intel’. Ask your peers how a professor conducts their class. Do they want you to memorize every last word and barf up factoids? Do they want you to synthesize, critique, and problem solve? Those are very different approaches.</li><li>Read the lesson slides ahead of time. I usually post all of them at beginning of term.</li><li>Skim the sources for each lesson ahead of time – they are challenging because they are the highest level of professional sources for analysis and knowledge. They represent the professionalism that you eventually achieve.</li><li>In each source, read and make notes on the abstract at least – because it ‘abstracts’ a complex set of ideas into a clear set of lessons learned or ideas launched, if the authors did it correctly.</li><li>Attend the lessons because this is where I weave the narrative, consider the evidence, explicate how the sources achieved or failed to achieve their objectives, and critique the state of knowledge and evidence for each lesson’s topic. I construct the lessons first, check the state of peer reviewed knowledge to ensure I am congruent with that, and then selected 3-5 sources each lesson because scholarly and professional integrity demand that I support the lesson with evidence and critique.</li><li>In each lesson you attend, make explanatory notes in real time to reinforce what you are learning.</li><li>Review and expand those notes within a week of each lesson.</li><li>Anticipate how an assignment or test is structured and what it might ask. I provide sample or practice versions of tests and assignments to help familiarize you with all that.</li><li>Start assignments at the very beginning of term by simply writing down your early thoughts.</li><li>It is usually possible to make quite a lot of progress on assignments and tests even if you have not yet encountered and/or grasped all the course material. How? See the steps above plus do what is possible early and often.<ul><li>For example, if you are in a course where it asks for outside literature on an assignment, use those little bits of time between other events in your day to hop online, use Web of Science to find promising peer reviewed papers, download them (because Web of Science via U Waterloo is great at this), change the filename to something meaningful (e.g. ERS 475 assignment on sustainability analysis – this is a great method by Smith 2021), and then synthesize these in a draft of your assignment. In a few weeks, you will have built a draft that is 70% done.</li><li>NOTE: Not all of my courses ask for the type of example above; it is a good example that applies to only some courses. You can do the same sort of thing if you are in a course that is focused on tasks that solely ask for engagement with class lessons. See above steps again.<br/> </li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>How do you take notes? Especially in real-time when there’s a lot going on? </strong></p><ul><li>How people do this varies. Some like to record what I am saying. That’s fine. The only restriction is that the material and my words is copyrighted by me; you get to use it but can’t share it with anyone else. Others like to physically write on paper – old school; usually, they print 4-6 of the slides from the deck and make notes on each in real time. Still others write marginal notes on each slide of the downloaded slide deck on their laptops or tablets; don’t forget to save the edits constantly or turn on auto-save. All my slides are posted on LEARN ahead of time.</li><li>You don’t need to hang on my every word. Again, take note of what I emphasize, dissect, critique, and elaborate upon. Take note of what you find challenging or need to rethink. If I toss out some minor factoid to make a point, it won’t show up on a test or assignment because it is not that important, I don’t run my classes using that dirty trick, and the chances are that it was extemporaneous so I probably would not remember raising it even a week later.</li><li>Yes I know you probably experienced teachers or professors who are shitheads who ask a question weighted at 20% of an assignment based on one offhand 30 second remark in class. I don’t do that. The assignments and tests in my courses reflect the emphasis and weighting of what is in the course material and/or on the Instructions for each.</li><li>If you prepared ahead of time, this is easier. Seriously. See previous notes on preparation.</li><li>I DO NOT want you to memorize every last word I wrote or said or memorize shit or barf up factoids.</li><li>I want you to synthesize, critique, and problem solve.</li><li>I want you to become conversant and familiar with a range of ideas.</li><li>I want you to begin the journey to understand evidence and how we do analysis to assess that evidence.</li><li>Some of that understanding means we must dissect how some rather scary-looking math equations allow us to achieve our goals. In my courses, we DO NOT memorize equations or try and make you all pure or applied mathematicians. I want you to confront fearful things and help guide you into a good understanding that it is not so scary. Understanding is what makes things less scary.  Your note-taking should reflect my intention.<ul><li>This means that on assignments or tests, I don’t ask that you reproduce and offer mathematical proofs for any analysis methods.</li><li>But I will ask that you are able to tell me:<ul><li>what choices of analysis we have</li><li>what might work best for a given ecological or socioecological problem we need to solve</li><li>what pitfalls we have to watch for</li><li>what assumptions of analysis methods do we need to test</li><li>given all of the above, how can we apply an analysis method to solve our problem – why would it work and how would it work</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Given all of this, your notes in real-time should be elaborations reflecting how I am using the foundation of what I put on slides and then critiqued what authors said or did; I often quote them on a slide and critique this in class. I don’t expect every word I say in class to be memorized or held sacrosanct. If you are puzzled by something, make note of it. Ask in class if you wish or ask me another time if you want to think about it first.</li><li>The bottom line is that I want to ensure you leave this course having become comfortable, familiar, and in some cases mastered a body of knowledge, evidence, analytical skills in both specific technical methods and problem solving critical thinking, critical writing, sophisticated writing, writing with confidence, and a vision for your personal and professional trajectory to achieve satisfaction in both. I aim to educate and train you so on the other side of this course you can get the job and life you want.<br/> </li></ul><p><strong>The School of Environment, Resources &amp; Sustainability (SERS) 'owns' ERS 337 and has 6 learning outcomes that we are asked to address in each SERS Course Outline/Syllabus.</strong>  The real trick is to see if anyone reads them. Are you reading this now? Are any of the admin reading this? We shall see. Last year, I asked my classes and the honest answer from students was that no one ever reads them for any of their classes, so I have no idea why we are required to list these if no one reads them. Maybe I'll ask something about this as a bonus question on one of our two tasks.</p><p><i>For those not in SERS, these are still germane to your learning process.</i></p><p>Outcome 1: Understand the challenges and opportunities of moving towards sustainability. Ecological restoration and rewilding are core to sustainable socioecological systems. The course emphases the technical and biophysical aspects inherent to this field but has specific lessons on social, economic, inclusion, and socioecological foci within rewilding and ecological restoration.</p><p>Outcome 2: Define and articulate core skills and areas of knowledge relating to SERS’ areas of strength.  Areas of strength in SERS relate to resource sectors such as water, soil, food, coastal zones and oceans, and biodiversity; to broad, cross‐cutting themes and areas such as sustainability assessment, environmental assessment, ecological economics, environmental politics, policy and governance, and ecosystem conservation and restoration; and to skills including ecological restoration techniques, institutional analysis, integration of understandings from multiple fields, and collaboration.  This course covers nearly all of these and focuses on skill building (I will be providing a document on LEARN listing skills that you learn in ERS 337).</p><p>Outcome 3: Understand and work within, between and across disciplines and ways of knowing.  This course not only delves into different technical and academic disciplines but also how cultural knowledge and inclusion is central to rewilding and ecological restoration.</p><p>Outcome 4: Mobilize skills and knowledge to contribute to better understandings, diagnoses and solutions for environmental and sustainability challenges and opportunities. The course, again, specifically addresses skill and knowledge building, professional communication, quantitative analysis and, again, a document articulating the skills built in ERS 337 will be provided on LEARN.</p><p>Outcome 5: Work collaboratively and effectively with people and organizations affected by or responsible for addressing environmental and sustainability challenges and opportunities. The nature of the course is such that we use case studies to show how collaboration and effective engagement is central to good practice and thought in rewilding and ecological restoration.</p><p>Outcome 6: Communicate ideas effectively in different oral and written formats to professional and public audiences. The course has dedicated lessons, multiple case examples of how this is done, a take home test to communicate application of your skills learned in this course and a final exam period case response that asks you to apply the complete set of skills to a real world challenge in rewilding and ecological restoration.</p>

Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
