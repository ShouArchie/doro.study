  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ERS 320:</div>
<p>This course offers an examination of relationship between the economy, the environment and sustainability. The course aims to provide students with an understanding of the differing viewpoints on the economy-environment relationship and their associated methods, including their strengths, weaknesses and applicability in a policy context.</p>

<div>
<p>This course examines the relationship between economics and sustainability in the context of global challenges, spanning from water and food security to climate change, biodiversity, and urbanization. We cover multiple perspectives in economics and trace the evolution of key drivers, debates, and policy approaches before turning to new frontiers of research and practice. The course format combines interactive lectures with exercises to build skills in economic and policy analysis, technical writing (policy briefings) for specialized audiences, and data analysis and visualization. The term will culminate in a poster session on sustainable economic futures with a focus on water, climate, and biodiversity - three areas where economists have prepared major reviews in the last 15 years. In 2025, we will carry out a class-wide project to build an atlas of the world's water markets, and we will critically engage with the 2024 findings and <a href="https://watercommission.org/">report</a> of the Global Commission on the Economics of Water. Weekly tutorials support interactive learning and exercises. These exercises form an integral part of the course and typically comprise debates, practicals (e.g. developing figures, working with datasets), and occasional discussions with practitioners. Students are encouraged to check for updates (and the revision history) for the outline at <a href="https://outline.uwaterloo.ca/">outline.uwaterloo.ca</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Participation (25%)</strong></p><p>Participation and class contributions are the foundation for the course. Students are expected to attend each class and participate in three ways: critical reading; active engagement in class discussions and debates; and completion of practical exercises during tutorials. Occasional pop-up quizzes will focus on key readings. Practical exercise #1 is due Feb 11th, and practical exercise #2 is due March 4th.</p><p><strong>Mid-term (15%)</strong></p><p>The mid-term exam, held Feb 26th, will be an in-class exam assessing understanding of core concepts and debates. The format will include multiple choice and short essays. A review session will occur on Feb 24th. <u>Anyone missing the mid-term will have the weight of the missed mid-term added to their final exam.</u></p><p><strong>Policy briefing (20%)</strong></p><p>Each student will be tasked with completing a policy briefing that applies economic concepts and methods to identify the causes of a water sustainability challenge and outline potential solutions. This year's theme will focus on water markets, and a list of case studies will be presented for students to choose. The policy briefing will total no more than 2000 words, and will include a summary of 100 words and no more than four (4) headline messages. Students are encouraged to include one (1) table and (1) figure to support their argument. A detailed protocol and guidelines will be available in Learn and discussed during class on 29th January. An outline (required) is due by Feb 13th and formative feedback will be provided by Friday, Feb 28th . The final submission is <strong>DUE March 21st.</strong></p><p><strong>Final exam (25%)</strong></p><p>The final exam, held during the exam period, will include multiple choice questions and essays addressing a series of focused on the economics of sustainability challenges and solutions. Essays will be assessed based on the clarity of the argument, the strength of the supporting evidence, and the quality of the writing. HELD during final exam slot.</p><p><strong>Poster Session: Atlas of Water Markets (15%)</strong></p><p>Students will prepare and present posters examining water markets around the world. The objective will be to characterize the supply and demand for water, the characteristics of water markets, including their market failures, and potential and proposed policies for addressing them. The poster presentation <strong>will occur in class on March 31st.</strong></p>

<p> </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>. The following text is recommended:<br/><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Research Ethics:</strong> The University of Waterloo requires all research conducted by its students, staff, and faculty which involves humans as participants to undergo prior ethics review and clearance through the Director, Office of Human Research and Animal Care (Office). The ethics review and clearance processes are intended to ensure that projects comply with the Office’s Guidelines for Research with Human Participants (Guidelines) as well as those of provincial and federal agencies, and that the safety, rights and welfare of participants are adequately protected. The Guidelines inform researchers about ethical issues and procedures which are of concern when conducting research with humans (e.g. confidentiality, risks and benefits, informed consent process, etc.). If the development of your research proposal consists of research that involves humans as participants, the please contact the course instructor for guidance and see: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics</u></a></p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/ about/equity-office3 </p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Declaring an absence: </strong>Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, instructors maintain agency over decisions regarding course component accommodations.  </p><p>Self-declared absences (for flu-like illness, short-term 48 hour self declared absences) must be submitted through Quest.</p><p>Absences requiring documentation (e.g. Verification of Illness Form, bereavement, etc.) - send your documentation to env-vif@uwaterloo. Do not send documentation to your advisor, course instructor, teaching assistant, or lab coordinator. Submission to env-vif@uwaterloo.ca<a href=""> </a>will notify all of your instructors of your absence. Students taking courses in Arts that require accommodation, should reach out to those instructors independently.</p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
