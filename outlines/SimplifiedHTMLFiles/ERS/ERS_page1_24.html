  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ERS 404 / PSCI 432:</div>
<p>Examination of the ways in which world society is striving to address environmental challenges by means of "global governance" - that is, international organizations and institutions intended to deal with these challenges. The history of international environmental politics will be reviewed, specific organizations and other actors involved in global environmental governance will be examined and the management of particular global environmental challenges investigated.</p>

<p>Our contemporary environmental crises do not operate in a political vacuum. Though efforts are made at all levels of society to address environmental issues, many of the challenges we face require transboundary coordination and governance. This course begins to unpack the various the challenges of governing environmental issues across international borders. Students will learn about conventional sites of state-based governance, international organizations and agencies as well as emerging forms of governance, including private governance and the role of non-state actors. Students will develop a sense of the various political interests that influence global environmental governance and the challenges to enacting effective governance. </p>

<h2>Course Engagement and Peer-Evaluation – 15%</h2><p>Course Engagement:</p><p>All students are expected to complete each week’s required readings and be prepared to engage in discussion about course content. As this is a 400-level class, there is a heavy emphasis on reading and discussing the materials. Keeping up with the readings is critical to your success in this class.</p><p>If you have to miss a class, you may also do the following:</p><ul><li>Write a short 300-word original reflection of your thoughts about ideas/concepts in the weekly readings and emailing it to me before the next week begins (i.e. by Monday morning at 9 a.m.). Note: this should not be a summary of the lecture or readings, but show you have done the readings and have something to say about them (i.e. Are the ideas useful? Unclear? Are there common themes that you see? Contradictions?)</li><li>Attend office hours (virtual or in-person) to discuss or ask good questions about that week’s course material.</li></ul><p><strong>This is <u>not</u> a remote/online class</strong> - you may not write written reflections every week in place of missing class. These are for unexpected, temporary absences only (i.e. illness, emergencies). If you must miss more than 2 consecutive classes, you should submit a VIF and consult with your Undergraduate Advisor.</p><p><strong>If you are concerned about your engagement grade:</strong> Let me know as soon as you can! It is best to discuss with me early in the term to resolve any issues or concerns so that we may come up with alternatives if need be. You should not wait until the end of the term to raise any concerns, as it will be too late to develop alternatives.</p><p><i>Peer- Evaluation and Self-Assessment:</i></p><p>This course involves a good deal of collaborative work. I will provide resources to help you and your research partner(s) to communicate and collaborate, but you are ultimately responsible for resolving issues and solving problems. At the end of the term, every student will recommend a performance grade for their partners and submit it with their own self-assessment. </p><p>On the last day of classes, <strong><u>you will submit a 250–350-word self-evaluation of your course engagement during the term</u></strong>. It is recommended that you keep your own record of the ways in which you engage with the course to make this assignment easier to complete. You may also describe challenges you had during the term, including working on the research project. Be sure to assign yourself a percentage grade (e.g. 75%). Your self-evaluation will be considered alongside the instructor’s record-keeping to determine the final grade. </p><p><strong><u>In addition, this document must also include a 100–150 word peer-evaluation of each research partner(s)’s</u></strong> performance and the nature of your collaboration this term. Please also assign your research partner a percentage grade (e.g. 75%). This peer-evaluation will also be used to determine the final course engagement score. More instructions will be available on LEARN.</p><p>In total, this assessment document should be <strong><u>350 – 500 words long.</u></strong></p><p> </p><h2>Mid-Term Test – 25% of Final Grade</h2><p>During Week 6, we will have an in-person written test.<strong> </strong>More details will be available closer to the Mid-Term date.</p><h2>Research Project </h2><p>You and your research partner(s) will work on one research topic this term, based on the course themes and contents in Global EcoPolitics.  In addition to writing a research paper, each team is responsible for delivering a course lesson (approx. 30-40 minutes in length) about your topic in Weeks 7-12. These student-led lessons and discussion will form the basis for the final exam.</p><p><strong>Course Lesson – 15%</strong></p><p>Based on your new expertise on global environmental governance from Weeks 1-5 in ERS 404/PSCI 432, you and your team are going to lead a course lesson about one of the topics listed in the course schedule below. Together, you will develop a presentation that outlines the global politics of your topic.</p><p>You and your team can (and should!) be creative with how you develop and present your lesson. There are many possibilities for how you might deliver your content. But regardless of the format that you choose, your lesson should do the following:</p><ol><li>A <strong>clear description of your research topic</strong>: the issue and/or global agreements you have been assigned.</li><li>Explain how or why this topic is of <strong>global, international or transboundary concern</strong>, demonstrating research beyond just what the textbook tells us.</li><li>Outline <strong>which key governance actors are involved</strong> in the global politics of this issue.</li><li>Demonstrate how your issue is illustrative of at least <strong>one major theme from Global EcoPolitics.</strong> For example: effectiveness, cognitive success, democratic legitimacy, justice, participatory access, shared benefits, and accountable transparency. Suggestions will be provided for each topic.</li><li><strong>Be well-organized and memorable with</strong> <strong>a clear learning outcome</strong> (i.e. what is the one thing you want the class to remember from your lesson). Any presentation materials should be visible from across the room and each speaker should speak loudly enough for us to hear and at a pace that is easy to understand. A microphone is available.</li><li><strong>Have a significant participation component for the class</strong>. Do not plan to just deliver a lecture for the entire time – find ways to engage the class in some kind of activity or discussion: break-out groups with good prompts for discussion (i.e. questions that we might reasonably disagree about); think, pair, share activities; brainstorming activities; a structured debate; a trivia game, etc.</li></ol><p>Each lesson should be <strong>30 - 40 minutes in length</strong>.<strong> </strong>Additional time will be allotted for follow-up questions from the class and the instructor, so your <u>entire time in front of the class may be up to 75 minutes.</u></p><p>You are responsible for bringing a USB key with your presentation or a device that can connect to the class podium via HDMI cable. If you need to log in to a website (e.g. Canva, Google), please do that on your own computer before your time to present. </p><p>More details and a grading rubric will be available on LEARN.</p><p><strong>Research Paper - 20%</strong></p><p>Your team will also write a research paper about your assigned topic. Your research paper will assess the power of different actors (note: NOT agreements) in governing, influencing, or reforming the governance around your topic. The paper must advance a <strong>scholarly argument </strong>(i.e. backed by good, peer-reviewed evidence that you find), taking a clear position about the roles of one or more actors in shaping (or even obstructing) the global or transboundary governance of this issue. </p><p>You will likely need to narrow down your research topic and that is perfectly acceptable (and encouraged, especially if you have been assigned more than one agreement!). You may find it useful to choose a specific group of countries, a region, or sub-issue related to your topic to make research more manageable. For example, if you are studying the UNFCCC, you might just focus on climate finance or the recent Loss and Damage fund agreement. But you will need to learn about your topic <i>before</i> you narrow down further.</p><p>In your paper, establish why the actors and/or institutions you choose are important to discuss. Be sure to address the influence and power wielded by these different actors and how they interact with each other. You should not plan to document every single type of governance actor in your issue area – that is too much to take on for this paper! Instead, your analysis will demonstrate your understanding of the various actors and dynamics in global environmental governance.</p><p>Remember to include an explanation of the <strong>global, international, or transboundary dimensions</strong> of this issue to do well on this paper.  Papers that only focus on domestic policy or politics in one country without making connections to the global, international, or transboundary dimensions do not meet the requirements of the assignment and are unlikely to earn a passing grade.<strong> </strong>It is critical that you demonstrate your understanding of the difference between domestic politics and international/global/transboundary politics.</p><p>Research essays should be <strong>4500-6000 </strong>words long, double-spaced, written in 12 pt. font and have a cover page with your names, chosen topic, and the course information. Please include a separate references page. <strong>Your references pages do not count towards the overall word count</strong>. </p><p>Research Essays should cite <i><strong>at least</strong></i><strong> 12 reputable sources</strong> to write your paper, including <i><strong>at least</strong></i><strong> 8 peer-reviewed academic sources. </strong>Academic sources include research journal articles and books/book chapters with academic presses (e.g. university presses, Routledge, Palgrave MacMillan, Polity Press, etc.). There is no upper limit to the number of sources you may cite. Be sure that your research encompasses the <strong>study of global politics</strong> <strong>and governance</strong> and not just the scientific literature about your research area. </p><p>Papers will be submitted to TurnItIn for similarity checking. If you would like to opt-out of TurnItIn, you will need to email me a comprehensive paper outline by Monday, March 11<sup>th</sup>. The whole team will also need to attend an in-person meeting with me to discuss your research findings and contributions to the paper in the week before the end of the term.</p><p>More details and a grading rubric will be available on LEARN.</p><h2>Final Exam – 25% of Final Grade</h2><p>The final exam will ask you to integrate lessons from the entire term, which will include the lectures, readings, and the research presentations. The exam will be held in-person during the exam period.</p>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<p><strong><u>Late Policy: </u></strong></p><p>After the grace period ends, the research paper and the self-evaluation will all be deducted 5% per day and will not be accepted 7 days after the initial due date. Late submissions will also be returned later than submissions made on time. Note that the late penalty on the self-evaluation will be reflected in the overall course engagement score.</p><p>Late take-home exams will not be accepted after the grace period ends and will earn a grade of zero. </p><p><strong><u>Grace Period: </u></strong></p><p>Life happens and often interrupts our best laid plans for the term. For this reason, all the written assignments have an automatic <strong>1-day grace period</strong> following the due date. There will be no penalty applied for essays or self-assessments handed in within 24 hours of these due dates. You do not need to provide documentation or ask to take advantage of this grace period – these days are just to acknowledge that things happen, and sometimes you need this breathing room. </p><p>The Grace Period <strong><u>does not apply to</u></strong> the research presentations, tests and exams. These are time sensitive and must be completed in class. </p><p>If you have or develop long-term issues that affect your academic performance, you should contact your Undergraduate Advisor and/or AccessAbility Services to help you arrange for accommodations. In SERS, the Undergraduate Advisor is Patti Bester. In PSCI, the Undergraduate Advisor is can be reached at <a href="mailto:PSCIadvising@uwaterloo.ca">PSCIadvising@uwaterloo.ca</a>. </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as reading and analysis. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
