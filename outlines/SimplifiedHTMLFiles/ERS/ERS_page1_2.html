  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ERS 101:</div>
<p>This course is one of 'solutions-based education' designed to use environmental case studies from local, provincial, national and international communities. We will analyze historical and contemporary cases and consider the interdisciplinary lessons that can be learned from them within the context of climate and technological change, political and economic constraints, community engagement and communication. The specific cases may change year by year depending on current events. Students will be encouraged to critically engage the scholarly, non-governmental, public media literatures and personalities.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p><i>ERS 101 is designed for students registered in one of the SERS undergraduate plans (Honours Environment, Resources and Sustainability; Joint Honours; and Minor). It is not a general-purpose environmental studies course open to the wider university community.</i></p><p>In addition to its goal of solutions-based education, ERS 101 serves a second function in the SERS curriculum: communication skills training. Students in the SERS BES degree program must complete the English Language Proficiency Examination (ELPE) milestone by the end of their 2B term. ERS 101 allows students who receive a grade of 65% or higher in the course to meet this milestone. In addition to providing an opportunity to meet the ELPE requirements, the course helps you develop the professional writing and oral communication skills you will need during your undergraduate education, and in your working life. Class sessions, tutorials and assignments fit together to help you develop essential research, writing and presentation skills.</p><p>Case studies and real-world examples are an important to learning in ERS 101. We will be using two kinds of cases this year:</p><ul><li>Water quality in the transboundary Great Lakes Basin shared by Canada and the United States provides a large frame within which we will explore challenges and solutions. I will use it during initial classes to explore key course themes such as sustainability, equity, systems thinking, interdisciplinarity, and collaboration.</li><li>Smaller, focused cases relating to environmental problems and solutions around the world at a host of scales appear throughout the course and add richness and diversity to our thinking. I will introduce some of these during the foundational class sessions before Reading Week; guest speakers will bring other cases to class in theme sessions that take place after Reading Week.</li></ul><p> </p>

<p>This section provides a brief overview of the assignments and examination in this course. Detailed information is provided on LEARN. </p><h4>Engagement with Class Readings via Perusall Before Class</h4><p>Most class sessions have assigned readings that must be completed in advance of the class. These readings are essential to your learning. You will use an online tool called Perusall to read documents, to leave questions and comments, and to respond to questions and comments from your peers. I will evaluate the quality of your engagement with the readings and your peers using Perusall. Your grade for engagement with the readings will be based on the total score across all the reading assignments, with each reading assignment equally weighted. During the first week of class, I will provide training and resources for using Perusall. Note that tutorials have their own reading requirements from the Ewald textbook; these readings are not part of the Perusall reading assignment. </p><h4>Professional Email and Letter</h4><p>Knowing how to write professional emails and letters is a basic and important skill that all SERS students need to have. In this assignment, you will write one of each, for two different scenarios. This assignment is an early opportunity for your TA to evaluate the quality of your writing. Submit your Professional Letter to the LEARN drop box, and email your Professional Email to your TA, before the start of your Week 3 tutorial. </p><h4>Challenge Presentation Slide Deck</h4><p>In this assignment, you will prepare a professional presentation using Microsoft PowerPoint. Your presentation slide deck will present insights into one aspect of the Great Lakes water quality challenge that your team is investigating during the course. This is an <i>individual</i> assignment, but you will coordinate with your team members to ensure that you are addressing different aspect of your team's challenge. You will not deliver <i>this </i>presentation; however, with approval from team members, it is acceptable to re-use material from individual Challenge Presentation slides in the team's Solutions Showcase presentation. You will submit your Challenge Presentation PowerPoint file through LEARN on February 14, 2025 by 11:59 PM.</p><h4>Solutions Report and Presentation</h4><p>Teams of students will analyze a Great Lakes water quality challenge and identify and assess relevant solutions. Teams will be created, and topic areas assigned, during the Week 3 tutorial sessions. The topic areas assigned to teams are broad. Therefore, each team will have a lot of scope to identify its own specific Great Lakes water quality challenge within the assigned topic area. A group self-evaluation process will be used to evaluate the performance of each team member; grades assigned to individual team members will be weighted based on this evaluation.</p><p>Teams will develop a linked <i>Solutions Report</i> and <i>Solutions Showcase Presentation</i>.</p><p><i><strong>Solutions Showcase Presentation</strong></i></p><p>Using short oral presentations with slides, your team will present a Great Lakes water quality challenge, and potential solutions, to the class during one of two sessions (weeks 10 and 11). A draft of your team's Solutions Showcase presentation is due in your tutorial session during Week 9; to gain experience and confidence, your team will practice delivering your draft presentation during the tutorial session in Week 9. The final Power Point slide deck for your team's presentation is due on LEARN on March 17, 2025 by 8:00 AM (note early morning time!). </p><p><i><strong>Solutions Report</strong></i></p><p>You and your team will prepare a formal written report that identifies and assesses potential solutions for a Great Lakes water quality challenge within your assigned topic area. The work that you do to prepare your Solutions Report will support development of your Solutions Showcase Presentation. At the same time, feedback you receive from the audience, your TA and me following your presentation will allow you to fine tune and strengthen your Solutions Report. The report is due through LEARN on April 3, 2025 by 11:59 PM.</p><h4>Tutorials: Assignments, Engagement and Professionalism</h4><p>The tutorial sessions are central to learning in the course. They provide the small group setting needed to help you develop and strengthen your teamwork, professional writing, and oral communication skills. You will learn to give and receive feedback to your peers through tutorial sessions as you develop your individual and group assignments. </p><p>All students have been assigned to one of the scheduled tutorial sessions. <i>You must attend only your assigned tutorial session</i>. Your grade for the tutorials is based on several small assignments, the quality of your engagement during the tutorials, and your professionalism. Small assignments that are part of the tutorial grade are described in detail on LEARN; they are linked to specific chapters in the Ewald text, and to stages related to completion of course assignments. The quality of your engagement and professionalism are evaluated by your TA at each tutorial session; this means that you have to attend your assigned tutorial session to be evaluated. </p><h4>Final Examination</h4><p>The final examination takes place during the examination period and will be scheduled by the Registrar's Office. It is your responsibility to know the dates of examinations, and to plan accordingly. All course material is covered on the exam. This includes assigned readings and videos, and content from lectures and tutorials. You will not be specifically tested on the material in Ewald, but you will be expected to know it and apply it during your examination.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen some assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<p>If we use the ERS 101 Teams channel, I am not planning to record sessions. </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Consultation (Instructor)</h4><p>Feel free to drop in during my scheduled office hours. Contact information is provided at the top of this course outline. If I’m with someone else or on a call when you drop by, please wait until I’m finished before knocking. </p><p>On the remaining days of the week, I’m going to be busy with administrative tasks, course preparation and marking, other classes, research projects, graduate student supervision, writing, scheduled appointments and other tasks. Please don’t disturb on these days unless it’s a dire emergency. </p><p>If you need to see me in person outside of my scheduled office hours, I’m always happy to make an appointment. We can meet in person or on Teams. </p><h4>Consultation (TA)</h4><p>The TA in charge of your tutorial session is available for in-person, virtual and email consultation. Contact information is provided at the top of this course outline. Your TA will inform you if their office hours change from what is shown in the outline. </p><h4>Laptops, Tablets and Mobile Phones</h4><p>We’re going to use cell phones and laptops during most class sessions. However, I need you to be professional. Use devices only for class-related work, including making notes and accessing course materials during class sessions. Checking email, browsing web sites, shopping, posting comments on social media, etc. during class time is unprofessional and disruptive.</p><h4>Recording During Class</h4><p>Students may not make recordings (audio, video, screen capture) during class and lab sessions. Violation of these rules may be deemed academic misconduct under University of Waterloo Policy 71.</p><h4>Microsoft Teams</h4><p>I create a Microsoft Teams channel for all my courses. In the event that it is not possible for us to meet in person (e.g., in-person classes are cancelled due to a resurgence of COVID-19), we will use the Teams channel to meet online. You are responsible for learning how to use Microsoft Teams effectively. </p><h4>Email Policy</h4><p>Email is an excellent way to contact me about straightforward problems and questions – and you don't have to wait for my scheduled consultation time. I will respond to your emails as promptly as possible. However, please be aware that I receive many emails each day that require a response. Therefore, it may take me a day or two to reply to your message.</p><p>Note that email is the official channel of communication between the University and its students. You are required to check your <i>uwaterloo.ca</i> email account regularly; I recommend that you check for course-related emails at least once per day. <i>If you use another email service, it is your responsibility to ensure that mail sent to your uwaterloo.ca account is forwarded to your other account. </i></p><h4>LEARN</h4><p>The following material is available on LEARN:</p><ul><li>Announcements</li><li>Schedule of dates</li><li>A schedule of my general availability</li><li>Instructions and handouts (e.g., detailed instructions for the assignments)</li><li>Pre-recorded lecture material (where used)</li><li>Week-by-week overview of topics covered, along with readings and copies of slides from lectures</li><li>Resources (e.g., links to key web sites, lists of journals, feedback on assignments)</li><li><i><u>It is your responsibility to learn how to use LEARN, and to check regularly for information and updates.</u></i></li></ul><p>Login to LEARN via: http://learn.uwaterloo.ca/   Use your WatIAM/Quest username and password. Documentation is available through the LEARN website.</p><h4>Declaring an Absence or Illness</h4><p>Self-declared absences (for flu-like illness, and short-term 48 hour self declared absences) must be submitted through Quest. </p><p>If you find yourself unable to meet an in-course requirement because of medical, compassionate or other reasons, send a Verification of Illness Form (VIF) and appropriate documentation to env-vif@uwaterloo.ca </p><p><u>Do not send documentation to me, your undergraduate advisor, or your teaching assistant</u>. All relevant people will be notified automatically when you send your information to env-vif@uwaterloo.ca</p><h4>Assignment Submission and Late Penalties</h4><p>Assignments must be submitted by the time and date specified in the instructions for that assignment. Follow the submission instructions for each assignment.  </p><p>If you have declared an absence or illness, and your absence has been accepted, you can normally submit assignments without penalty. However, in every case where your request has been accepted, I or your TA (as appropriate) will set a new deadline or grade allocation that matches the nature of the absence or illness. Submissions beyond the agreed extension date will incur the late penalty. </p><p>Late assignments normally will be penalized at the rate of 5 percent of the value of the assignment per day, including Saturday and Sunday. Assignments submitted more than 5 days after the due date will receive a grade of 0 unless a longer extension was approved. </p><p>Importantly, some assignments cannot be accepted late under any circumstances; in these cases, another grading scheme will have to be used (to be determined by the instructor or TA).</p><p><i>Manage your time carefully. Pressure of work, computer glitches, etc. are not an acceptable reason for seeking an extension without penalty. </i></p><h4>Required Style Guide and Citation Format</h4><p>With amendments noted in the instructions for specific assignments, we will use the following <i>required </i>book as our course style guide:</p><p>Ewald, Thorsten. 2020. <i>Writing in the Technical Fields: A Practical Guide</i>, 3rd edition. Don Mills, Ontario: Oxford University Press.</p><p>Note that this book explains how to use the IEEE citation format. We will be using APA 7th Edition. Instructions for using APA 7th are available on LEARN.</p><h4>Group Work and Collaboration</h4><p>Discussing individual assignments with your colleagues is an excellent way to learn from your peers and to test your ideas. However, unless the assignment requires group work and collaboration, you must complete assignments individually. </p><h4>Co-op interviews and class attendance</h4><p>Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><h4><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement</strong></h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><h4><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong></h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/ about/equity-office3 </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>You may use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce images for your presentation slide decks, but you must properly document each image. You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all images you use, including any created or supported by generative AI. Ideally, you should use real photographs with proper documentation instead of generated images, but I am making the option to use GenAI images available to you for the specific purpose of creating imagery.</p><p>You may not use GenAI tools such as Chat GPT to generate text for your assignments, or to paraphrase other peoples' text for your assignments. Learning how to write professionally is a core activity in ERS 101. Using GenAI tools to do your writing undermines that goal, and is treated as academic misconduct. </p><p>You should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
