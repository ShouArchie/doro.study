  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ERS 215:</div>
<p>An introduction to processes and techniques for incorporating environmental considerations in planning and evaluating proposals for future undertakings that may have significant social and biophysical effects. The course provides an overview of methodologies for, and controversies surrounding, the design and conduct of biophysical and socioeconomic impact studies, and the testing of reported findings. The main focus is on the purposes and design of environmental assessment processes, with particular reference to the Canadian federal and Ontario provincial legal mandates, and the evolution of assessment into a sustainability framework.</p>

<p><strong>Approach:</strong></p><p>Online asynchronous modules will be used to provide an overview of key topics and also to highlight important themes. Key topics and themes will be elaborated on through videos and by regular attention to case studies. Assigned readings throughout the semester are critical for providing additional depth and breadth. Group reading discussion and assignments provide an opportunity for integrating key topics and themes, as well as for linking them with the broader scholarly literature on environmental assessment. From this course you will develop a key understanding of what an EA should be and therefore, you can apply this knowledge and understanding to any assessment act. Please refer to LEARN for all course details. </p><p><strong>Course Technologies: </strong></p><p>We will use LEARN and Contensis Course Management System (CMS) in this course. The link to CMS will be provided on the LEARN platform. On LEARN you will also have access to Dropbox for assignment submissions. On CMS, you will have access to the course contact information, course outline, assignment instructions and course content in module format. Ensure that you refer to the LEARN site for the most up to date course information.</p><p><strong>Use of AI sites is strictly forbidden:</strong> If there are any suspicions regarding the use of AI to write any of the course work assignment, you might be asked to meet with the professor to describe your approach to the assignment in or potentially be given an alternative assignment to complete. </p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Any request for re-marking of any review quizzes or other course assignments, must be submitted in writing via email to your TA <strong>within one week </strong>of the release of the mark in question. Your request for a re-mark must be specific and clearly state which question or component you feel was mismarked and why. After consulting with your TA, you may ask the Instructor for a re-mark, but note, that the entire assignment will be marked, possibly resulting in a higher or lower mark.  </p><h3>Numeric Grade Scale</h3><p>Numeric grades on a scale from 0-100 are used in grading all assignments at the University of Waterloo. The following list will give you an idea of the basis upon which numeric grades are assigned:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Percentage</td><td>Measurement</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;90%  </td><td>Work that shows a high level of initiative and is clearly above and beyond what is expected. Referencing, style, grammar/spelling, content and the development of ideas are all superior. (Similar to A and A+ in the previous system)</td></tr><tr><td>80-90%  </td><td>Work that shows good initiative and is above what is expected. Referencing, style, grammar/spelling, content and the development of ideas are all good. (Similar to B+ and A- in the previous system)</td></tr><tr><td>70-79% </td><td>Work that shows initiative and is about what is expected, but one or more problems are evident in referencing, style, grammar/spelling, content and/or the development of ideas. (Similar to B- and B in the previous system)</td></tr><tr><td>60-69%  </td><td>Work that does not demonstrate initiative, has a series of problems in referencing, style, grammar/spelling, content and/or the ideas, and overall, does not fully convince the reader's that the topic has been well considered. (Similar to C-, C and C+ in the previous system)</td></tr><tr><td>50-59%  </td><td>Work that is substandard/sloppy in places, has many problems in referencing, style, grammar/spelling, content and/or the development of ideas, and overall, raises more questions in a reader's mind than the work answers. (Similar to D-, D and D+ in the previous system)</td></tr><tr><td>40-49% </td><td>Work that is of consistently poor quality, demonstrates gaps incomprehension of the assigned material, and/or indicates that not enough time was taken to properly address the assignment. (Similar to F and F+ in the previous system)</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;40%  </td><td>Work that is clearly of poor quality, demonstrates a lack of comprehension of the assigned material, shows little attempts at a personal development of ideas or efforts to back up arguments with suitable evidence, and/or indicates that the work was completed "at the last minute".</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
</p>
<div>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong><u>Late Submissions: </u></strong></p><p>The exam is mandatory, and thus, students are expected to be present at the time of the exam. If you miss an exam/or assignment you must provide reasonable documentation (a university verification of illness form) explaining the reason for your absence, degree of incapacitation, dates covered by the note to be considered for an alternative arrangement. <strong>According to university policy, your VIF must be provided within 48hrs of the missed assignment/quiz or exam/test date.</strong> Please make a copy of this note and give the copy to your Professor by hand or scanned and sent by email (email to fegunyu@uwaterloo.ca). If you are registered with Accessibility Services and require an accommodation you must contact them first, prior to the deadline and the Professor will work with the coordinator to accommodate your request. Simply missing a deadline, and stating that you are registered with accessibility services is not adequate enough for an extension. </p><p>Please ensure that you are diligent in <strong>backing up computer files</strong><i><strong> </strong></i>and making <strong>draft copies</strong><i><strong> </strong></i>of all assignments, as computer failures, printer problems, inability to open files etc., will not normally be considered a valid reason to waive the late assignment deduction. <strong>NOTE</strong>: Perhaps the easiest way to prevent computer file loss is to send to yourself an email attachment of your assignment after each significant work session.</p><p><strong>Group Reading Discussion</strong></p><p>You are to sign-up for two group discussion time-slots for the term. You are making a commitment to attend the session. Failure to attend the session without a valid VIF or <i>prior</i> discussion with the course instructor and TA, will result in a grade of zero for the discussion grade. </p><p><strong>Briefing Note Assignment, Public Comment Paper and Engage with an EA/IA Assignment</strong></p><p>The briefing note is an essential learning component of the course, therefore you must hand in the assignment to receive a mark for the course. There is an extended deadline available to you for your briefing note and public comment paper. Students have a 24 hour grace period after the due date where they can submit their assignment without penalty. After 24 hours - up to 72 hours past the due date there is a 10% penalty off of the final mark of the assignment/paper. <strong>Briefing note assignments and the public comment paper, submitted past the 3 day (72 hours) grace period, will not be accepted and a mark of zero will be given</strong>. <strong>No extensions will be granted</strong>. </p><p><strong>Final Exam</strong></p><p>Final exams must be submit by the due date. Failure to submit, will result in a grade of zero for the exam. The exam date and time are set prior to the beginning of term and therefore, cannot be modified. The exam is set over a 48hr period. It is designed to take ~ 3-5 hours to complete and therefore, it is your responsibility to manage your time and your other course commitments to successfully complete this exam. If you miss an exam, you must provide a VIF explaining the reason for your absence (within 24 hours), degree of incapacitation, dates covered by the note, to be considered for an alternative arrangement. Please make a copy of this note and give the copy to your instructor by hand or scanned and sent by email to instructor through LEARN. The professor will determine if there is an acceptable reason for a late submission – <i>if</i> the exam is accepted, a 20% late penalty will apply if it is accepted within 24hrs of the due date. This will be at the sole discretion of the professor. </p><p><strong><u>Communication with Instructors and TAs </u></strong></p><p>Students’ UW email accounts will be used for all communication. Students are responsible to check their UW email and LEARN accounts regularly. All course announcements will be posted to LEARN. An effort will be made by the TAs and the Instructor to deal with email requests, within two business days of receipt (48 hours). The instructor does not respond to emails outside of regular working hours (M-F ~8:30 AM- 5:00 PM). <i><strong>The instructor will only respond to emails sent through the LEARN email message system. </strong></i>If you require a timelier response, post your question to the LEARN discussion board. The course LEAD TA will be monitoring the discussion board daily. Further, other students in the course might respond quicker. All emails and communications with the TAs and course instructor must be respectful and professional. Any unprofessional and disrespectful emails will be reported. Please note it is your responsibility to ensure that your computer is up to date and compatible. </p><p><strong><u>Remarking Request</u></strong></p><p>Any request for re-marking of briefing note assignment or public comment paper,<i> </i><strong>must be submitted in writing via email to your TA within one week of the release of the mark in question.</strong> Your request for a re-mark must be specific and clearly state which question or component you feel was mismarked and why. After consulting with your TA, you may ask the Instructor for a re-mark, but note, that the entire assignment will be marked, possibly resulting in a higher or lower mark. </p><p><strong><u>Technical Support </u></strong></p><p>If you are unable to access Waterloo LEARN or course content you must contact Technical Support at learnhelp@uwaterloo.ca. Include your full name, WatIAM user ID, student number, and the course name and number. Technical support is available during regular business hours, Monday to Friday, 8:30 to 4:30 PM (Eastern Time). Further, trouble shooting for LEARN can be found here: https://uwaterloo.ca/learn-help/students. Often, if you log out of LEARN and exit your web browser and then log back in, you can access LEARN again. Remember that your textbook has a lot of course material in it – so you can access a lot of course content without LEARN, should you need to study etc. Ultimately, if access issues or technological issues in opening assignments, are not due to any University of Waterloo changes/updates, it is your responsibility to fix the problem. </p><p><strong><u>To Avoid Plagiarism: </u></strong></p><p>The use of other people's work must be properly acknowledged and referenced in all written material such as take-home examinations, essays, research papers, laboratory reports, work-term reports, design projects, statistical data, computer programs and research results. The properly acknowledged use of sources is an accepted and important part of scholarship. Use of such material without complete and unambiguous acknowledgement, however, is an offence under Policy 71.  The use of AI websites is prohibited. </p><p>TIPS for quoting, paraphrasing, and summarizing (source: <a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/563/1/">http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/563/1/</a>) These three ways of incorporating other writers' work into your own writing differ according to the closeness of your writing to the source writing. </p><ul><li>Quotations must be identical to the original, using a narrow segment of the source. They must match the source document word for word and must be attributed to the original author with page number.</li><li>Paraphrasing involves putting a passage from source material into your own words. A paraphrase must also be attributed to the original source. Paraphrased material is usually shorter than the original passage, taking a somewhat broader segment of the source and condensing it slightly.</li><li>Summarizing involves putting the main idea(s) into your own words, including only the main point(s). Once again, it is necessary to attribute summarized ideas to the original source. Summaries are significantly shorter than the original and take a broad overview of the source material.</li></ul><p>Note on sharing course content and assignments: students will not share any of their course work, any course content or assignments with any person or company that will make the content available online to others – such as Course Hero. </p><h4><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement</strong></h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><p> </p>
