  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ERS 431:</div>
<p>This course focuses on the ecological consequences of climate change and associated effects on biodiversity. This course examines the challenges a changing climate poses for ecology, conservation biology research and management. The evidence that we will use in this course will be taken from scientific papers, expert knowledge systems and a variety of alternative approaches.</p>

<p>I see that the learning that will occur in this course will happen in many different directions. I want you to learn from me and I want to learn from you. We all bring such varied perspectives to the conversation. Journal articles, guest speakers and other forms of media will also help us distill ideas and provide essential resolution to our ideas. Knowledge, like landscapes, changes across space and through time. By the end of this course, you should be on a path to life-long learning as an ecologically literate citizen and well-versed in ecological consequences of climate change.</p>

<h2>
  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Identify and explain, with examples, the main principles of ecology from a variety of perspectives and across a variety of scales</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Demonstrate how these principles and concepts apply to real-world situations</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Analyze the elements of climate change science</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Evaluate how we communicate and understand the ecological consequences of climate change</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p role="note">These course learning outcomes will not only prepare you to be an informed citizen and member of the community of life on earth, but also provide the basis for knowledge, humility, and wisdom in your dealings with ecological problems in your daily life and eventual career.</p>

<p><strong>Mental health: </strong>Along with the University of Waterloo and the Faculty of Environment and its Departments, I consider your wellbeing to be extremely important. We recognize that many students face health challenges, physical and/or emotional. Please note that help is available. Mental health is a serious issue for everyone and can affect your ability to do your best work. Counselling Services (www.uwaterloo.ca/counselling-services) is an inclusive, non-judgmental, and confidential space for anyone to seek support. They offer confidential counselling for a variety of areas including anxiety, depression, grief, relationship issues, sexuality, stress management, substance use, and much more.</p><p><strong>Religious observances:</strong> Please email me at the beginning of term if you require special accommodation for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and assignments.</p><p><strong>Deadlines: </strong>There is a penalty of 5% per day for late submissions. </p><p><strong>Assignment submission: </strong>Please refer to the course schedule and LEARN documents for detailed instructions on submission of all assignments and assessments. </p><p><strong>Attendance and preparation:</strong> You are strongly encouraged to engage with class content because they will be interactive in nature and develop the course material. Thus, please come to class prepared to discuss and engage. </p><p><strong>Lecture handouts and intellectual property:</strong> Powerpoint lectures will not be a complete transcription of the lecture. I will not include all information (to encourage you to be active note-takers), or all images (for copyright reasons). These slides are meant to be a template for your note-taking: they will not replace careful attention, note-taking and participation. These are important skills to develop for your future study and career. You should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property (IP) of the instructor and the University of Waterloo. IP includes items such as lecture content, both spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof); lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials in the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides); and questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams). Course materials, and the IP contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this IP without the owner’s permission is a violation of IP rights. For this reason, you must ask for permission before uploading and/or sharing the IP of others online (e.g., to an online repository). Permission is also necessary before sharing the IP of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. Please alert the instructor if you become aware of IP belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The IP rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p>No course material may be shared or used outside this course. The only exceptions are those materials that are external (cited) courses (e.g., TedEd, YouTube, textbook, journal articles) which may be used or shared as permitted by the content owners. If any presenter in this course discloses information for the benefit of your learning but requests you do not disclose the source of the information or share the information itself, please respect those wished. </p><h4> </h4><p><strong>Generative AI: </strong>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
