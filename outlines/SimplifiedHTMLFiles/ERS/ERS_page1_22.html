</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ERS 401:</div>
<p>Translational ecology analyses ecosystems in a manner that leads to better policies, decision-making, and action. It is where environmental sciences meet environmental policy and governance. Translational ecology further embraces how the arts, media, and culture can act upon what emerges from analysis of socioecological systems. ERS 401 will focus student efforts on action-based and innovative modules and projects that provide a path to students designing their short- and long-term careers.</p>

<p>What is translational ecology? It is a concept that connects end users (decision-makers, policy makers, practitioners, stakeholders, etc.) to research and scientists to address environmental issues in actionable ways. It involves both the inclusion of said end-users in the development of research and the communication of science to a broader audience. This allows for the development of tools, frameworks, and scientific outputs that can be implemented by many users and stakeholders to make change that addresses environmental issues in evidence-based ways. I take a broad view of ecology, where “eco” comes from the Greek root “oikos” meaning home. In this way, I consider “ecology” to be the setting where social-ecological interactions occur.</p><p>In this course, you will engage deeply with the concept of translational ecology (and its related terms) in ways ranging from theoretical frameworks to practical examples. You will synthesize your previous learning from your degree program, analyze best practices for implementing translational ecology, create innovative tools for “translating” social-ecological systems’ concepts to a general audience, and reflect on your how your academic learning contributes towards your future career pursuits.</p>

<p><strong>Creative Translation Assignment (15%)</strong></p><p>For the creative translation assignment, you will use arts-media to take any issue related to environment, resources, and sustainability and translate it for a general audience. The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate how environmental concepts can be translated to non-academic audiences. You will also write a brief (~250 word) description of your arts-media production and how it translates your identified concept. You will submit this assignment to the LEARN drop box and bring the assignment into class. We will have an in-class “showcase” of all the translations and you will engage with your peers' arts-media assignments. The assignment will be due at the start of class time on Tuesday, January 28. Additional details will be provided on LEARN.</p><p><strong>Mid-term Test (20%)</strong></p><p>You will have one in-class test during the term on Thursday, February 13. It will cover the course material (including lectures and readings) through week 5 of the course. I will provide additional details about the test during lecture and on LEARN.</p><p><strong>Guest Lecture Engagement (15%)</strong></p><p>We will have multiple guest lectures throughout the term who will be presenting on how they implement translational ecology in their work. You will need to participate and engage with guest speakers during the term by submitting questions in advance of each guest lecture and attending class to engage in-person. Additional details will be provided on LEARN.</p><p><strong>Future YOU Reflection (15%)</strong></p><p>For the Future YOU assignment, you will write a "future bio" for yourself. You will both reflect on how translational ecology relates to you and on how it contributes towards your future plans, desires, goals, and ambitions. Then, you will envision where you will think you'll be in 50 years, how you will be implementing translational ecology, and how you might be addressing environmental challenges. You are encouraged to use a creative writing style for this assignment. This assignment is due on Friday, March 21. Additional details will be provided on LEARN.</p><p><strong>Final Group Project (35%)</strong></p><p>In groups of ~5 students, you will design and implement a translational ecology group pilot project. This project will allow you to apply the concepts of translational ecology to a real-world case example, while also gaining skills in engaging with the non-academic community. In your group, you will select an ecological issue, identify relevant stakeholders and knowledge holders, design a translational ecology activity, pilot your project with non-academic parties, and report on your project implementation. This assignment contains three scaffolded components:</p><ul><li>An <i>Project Proposal</i> draft (5% of course grade): Due Feb 7</li><li>A <i>Presentation</i> (worth 10% of course grade): Due April 1</li><li>The <i>Final Report</i> (worth 20% of course grade): Due April 11</li></ul><p>Additional details will be provided on LEARN.</p>
