The panel presentations will be offered online as will the group responses. Given the practical difficulties of effective class engagement in online preparation of group responses, the grade percentage assigned to class engagement may have to be reduced and re-assigned to other course components.</p><p><strong>Roles and purposes of the course</strong></p><p>As the final core course in the series for a Diploma in Environmental Assessment, ERS 415 is the culmination of a series of studies in the field. The course reviews and synthesizes material from the preceding pre-requisite courses on assessment principles and methodologies. The focus, however, is on the major current directions and trends in environmental and sustainability assessment – the most advanced thinking and applications in the field and the most pressing stresses today, especially in Canada. In particular, the course examines how new appreciation of complexities and uncertainties, and rising imperatives for progress towards sustainability, are affecting assessment thinking and application, while at the same time we are seeing increasing pressures for more streamlined assessment processes and quicker approvals for economically and/or politically attractive undertakings.</p><p>While assessment theory, law and practice have improved over the past 50+ years, with greater practitioner experience and higher public expectations, they have also proved to have serious limitations. In Canada and elsewhere, most assessment processes have focused on individual proposed projects and have aimed to identify and mitigate their significant adverse effects. Some jurisdictions give serious consideration only to predicted negative effects on the biophysical environment. We have learned, however, that the most serious concerns arise from the combined adverse social and biophysical effects of multiple undertakings and their legacies. We have also seen that the expectations of host regions and communities are increasingly for projects to deliver positive contributions to lasting wellbeing rather than merely avoid serious negative effects. </p><p>Consequently, assessments have been pushed to be more comprehensive (covering the complex interactions of cumulative as well as individual social and biophysical effects), more ambitious (aiming for positive contributions to sustainability as well as mitigation serious adverse effects), more far-sighted (especially where climate changes issues are raised), more broadly applied (to regional/strategic or planning level undertakings as well as individual projects), more transparent and credible (including more open and responsive to public engagement and more forthright about the reasoning behind recommendations and decisions). Also, assessment in Canada has been affected by better understanding of complex socio-ecological systems, Indigenous rights, and need for fairer distribution of benefits and risks. </p><p>We have available approaches to addressing all these considerations. We know that project-level assessments have tended to be too narrow in scope and too late in decision making to address overall concerns about the integrity of ecosystems and the wellbeing of communities or to introduce significantly more sensitive and sustainable approaches. We also know that conventional project-based assessments have tended to be inadequate means of ensuring properly integrated consideration of the interrelated ecological, social and economic factors that determine long term effects. </p><p>Early steps to act on these understandings have improved assessments considerably – leading to better project planning, more informed decisions and greater long-term public benefits. But the needed changes raise fears of assessment becoming more demanding and difficult, maybe more expensive and possibly slower as well. And any move to improve assessments these days faces competing political pressures. Some Canadian jurisdictions have already moved to make assessments easier and faster, arguing that the results will help them address key immediate concerns such as more housing and expansion of critical mineral mining.</p><p>A major question for the future therefore is how to design and apply assessments more creatively and intelligently so they can meet rising needs and expectations while also being manageable, affordable and timely. </p><p>The course will examine the nature, significance and application of broader approaches to assessment, and accompanying efficiency issues, with emphasis on Canadian cases in various jurisdictions, within and beyond the usual realm of assessment law. It will review the academic and professional literature on advanced assessment thinking and will emphasize critical examination of practical cases where advanced assessment initiatives have been proposed and/or undertaken. Participants in the course will be expected to become familiar with the main components of advanced assessment (now being explored as a “next generation assessment” package), to see how they may be integrated for application in actual cases and in the redesign of assessment law, policy and practical implementation. </p><p>For some particular examples, the course will often take advantage of cases across the country, through several decades and under various assessment and planning regimes.  It will pay particular attention the federal impact assessment law and process, which came into effect in August 2019 and was revised in June 2024. While the federal process applies only to matters under federal jurisdiction, many assessment cases and issues involve the overlapping interests and responsibilities of two or more jurisdictions (federal, provincial, Indigenous, territorial, even municipal). As a result, the scope of the federal law’s implications extends across the country. </p>

<p><strong>The organization of the sessions, the assignments and evaluations </strong></p><p>After the introductory session in the first week, each session of the course will be divided into two parts, a lecture for the hour or so and discussion in the second portion covering that session’s questions related to the lecture and the readings. The questions and their implications will be considered from the perspectives of various interests. For details on how each session – including the lecture review, the panel presentations and group responses – will be organized, please see the “Tuesday meeting timings” document on the course Learn website, under the Syllabus tab.</p><p>The lectures (see above) begin with three sessions that provide an overview and background to the main issues now facing assessment in Canada and some big issue cases to which we will be referring throughout the course. The next two sessions consider sustainability assessment practice and application issues. Sessions 6-12 address particular areas of innovation. </p><p>Each participant’s work in the course will centre on the following contributions:</p><ul><li>engagement in the session discussions at the Tuesday meetings</li><li>a two-and-a-half-minute panel presentation in one of sessions 4-11</li><li>three briefing papers – one on sustainability-based next generation assessment (sessions 1-4), one on complex sustainability-related cumulative effects (sessions 4-8) and one on collaborative multi-jurisdictional assessment (covering the whole course but with emphasis on sessions 10-12).</li></ul><p>The evaluations will be weighted as follows:</p><ul><li>class engagement in sessions 1-6                   10%</li><li>class engagement in sessions 7-12                 10% </li><li>panel presentation, script and references        10%</li><li>briefing paper 1, due 7 February                    15%</li><li>briefing paper 2, due 13 March                      25%</li><li>briefing paper 3, due 10 April                        30%</li></ul><p><i><strong>Panel presentations and class engagement</strong></i></p><p>After the lecture discussion (roughly one hour), the remainder of each Tuesday meeting will be divided into two periods of about 45 minutes each. The first period will be devoted to considering the first of the two class meeting discussion questions for the session. The second period will address the second discussion question for the session. </p><p>See part 2 of the syllabus on the details for the course sessions, including the issues, readings, and class meeting discussion questions for each session. See also the “415w25 Tuesday meeting timings” document in the syllabus file.</p><p>In most sessions, the questions will be addressed by participant panels and responses from class groups representing various interests. The discussions will consider implications for the design of next generation assessment law and policy regimes, in Canada and beyond, and implications for practical application in current or anticipated cases. As well, the discussions should be useful in preparing for the three briefing papers.</p><p>To facilitate all this, the class has been divided into eight groups (A-H) each with six or seven members. Each group has been given rotating assignments through sessions 2-11. The assignments involve representing the (enlightened) understandings and interests of authorities, stakeholders or other groups that are major players in assessments and/or likely to be significantly affected by assessment decisions. </p><p>The nine categories of authorities, stakeholders, etc., to be represented are as follows:</p><ol><li>federal, provincial and/or territorial public sector proponents of projects subject to assessment requirements</li><li>private sector proponents of projects subject to assessment requirements</li><li>federal, provincial and/or territorial government assessment process administrators, reviewers and decision makers (includes civil servants and ministers and their political staff)</li><li>Indigenous governments as responsible and affected authorities</li><li>municipal and regional governments, local business groups and community organizations potentially affected by assessed undertakings </li><li>non-government organizations focusing on ecological and social justice issues</li><li>non-government organizations focusing on economic concerns</li><li>independent experts on major assessment issues (e.g., ecologists, socio-economic analysts, climate change policy experts, Indigenous law specialists) </li><li>advocates for the interests of future generations, including experts in the design of sustainability-based next generation assessment regimes (laws and policies, institutions, applications and practices).</li></ol><p>The assignments for each session are set out in the <u>“415w25 engagement assignments” document</u>, which is in the Syllabus file under the Content tab on the course Learn site. </p><p>Each team will serve as the panel members for one of sessions 4-11. Every session will have two panels (each made up of half the team) – one for each of the two discussion questions for the session. Each panelist will address the assigned question from the perspective of one of nine categories of main assessment authorities, stakeholders or interests set out above.</p><p>For the sessions in which they are not the panelists, each group has been assigned to think from the perspective of an interest from one of the nine categories. The assigned roles for the groups change from one session to the next. In their role for the particular session, the group members will develop their response to the panel presentations on each of the two questions. For each question in many of sessions 2-12, one individual in each group has been pre-assigned to be the group’s respondent (identified as “R” in the “415w24 engagement assignments” document on the course website). For sessions where no individual has been identified as the group’s respondent, the group can choose who is to take the responsibility for that session, recognizing that everyone should have equal opportunity. </p><p><i><u>The panel presentations and submitted scripts with references</u></i></p><p>For each of sessions 4-11, the discussion portion will address the two questions set out in the syllabus for that session. Consideration of each question will be initiated by a panel drawn from one of the groups (group A for session 4, group B for session 5, and so on). </p><p>Each panelist assigned to the question will make a maximum two-and-a-half-minute statement setting out what are, in the panelist’s view, the most important matters and how they should be addressed as the answer to the question from the enlightened perspective of the interest(s) the panelist is representing. </p><p>Each panelist will choose to represent the interests of one (or a combination of two) of the nine categories of assessment participants (authorities, stakeholders, etc.) listed on page 7 above.</p><p>At the session prior to the session of your group’s panel presentations, each panelist will meet with the instructor or teaching assistant in the first break to choose a category (or pair of categories) to represent. </p><p>The oral panel presentation and the associated papers (script with references to the sources used) will be graded and represent 10% of the final grade. The script notes can be in point form if that is what was used for the presentation. After the class session but before midnight that day, the panelists are to submit their presentation notes in the Learn dropbox for panel presentations. Feedback and grades will be provided through the dropbox. </p><p>The panelists will be expected play their representation roles professionally and realistically. Their positions should draw from the readings and from material discussed in previous sessions (and previous courses) as well as from general knowledge of the key concerns of the interests being represented. The positions presented should be well-informed and enlightened as well as concise.</p><p><i>Panel presentations evaluation rubric</i></p><p>The central considerations for grading the presentations (and scripts/references) are as follows:</p><ul><li>clear and constructive response to the question being addressed</li><li>evident understanding of the concepts, issues and response options involved, and insight into their practical implications</li><li>evident familiarity with the readings and other source material (references)</li><li>plausible presentation of the perspective of the enlightened players being represented, while also recognizing needs to find some measure of consensus (e.g., through points that might win support from participants with other perspectives)</li><li>synthesis, integration and drawing connections between and among the immediate subject matter and ideas, issues and insights from the course materials or elsewhere</li><li>reference to at least one case example (participants in past offerings of the course have reported that presentations that provide case illustrations are typically more compelling)</li><li>effective oral communication skills (clear, concise, credible, and able to keep within the time limit)</li><li>well-prepared and referenced script (or script notes) for the presentation</li><li>accuracy and creativity in illustrating applications and implications (e.g., through case examples – see above) as appropriate, and, as always,</li><li>special credit for wit and humour.</li></ul><p><i><u>Class engagement in responses to the panel presentations</u></i></p><p>Except in sessions when they are serving as panelists, the group members will serve as commentators with assigned perspectives. After the discussion of a question has been introduced by the instructor and teaching assistant (sessions 2, 3 and 12) or by panelists from the assigned group (sessions 4-11), we will have a short (8 minutes) response preparation period for members of each group to discuss the questions and presentations and to prepare a group response to the question and the panel views. </p><p>For most of the panels and questions in sessions 2-12, one group member from each group has been assigned to be that group’s respondent (see the “415w25 engagement assignments” document). The respondent delivers to the whole class a brief oral summary of the group’s response to the relevant question and panel presentations (about one minute will be sufficient)<i>. </i></p><p>Each participant in the course has been assigned the respondent role for two sessions. Because respondents have not been assigned for all sessions, additional opportunities are available. If any of your assigned dates are problematic, you can trade dates with one of your group members.</p><p>As time permits, at the end of the discussion of each question, we will have an open-to-all opportunity to consider what level of agreement is evident or could be possible among the different (but enlightened) interests. However, we will also recognize areas of deep disagreement and consider the implications.</p><p>The “415w25 engagement assignments” document posted with the syllabus on the course UW Learn site is crucial and will be reviewed at the first class. It sets out the assignment of individuals to teams, to panel presentation sessions and questions, and to presenting group responses to the panels and questions. It also covers the assignment of the groups to rotating interest perspectives for sessions 2-11 (excepting when they are panelists). </p><p><i>IIndividual contributions</i></p><p>While the course involves group activities and expects demonstration of collaborative skills, evaluations are based on individual contributions. As noted above, one session prior to their presentation session, participants in each panel are to meet with the instructor or a teaching assistant during the first class break to determine what categories of assessment participants they choose to represent on their panel. Beyond that, there is no expectation for the panel members or commentators to meet with their groups before the class to coordinate positions. The contributions of the panelists and commenting participants will be graded individually.</p><p>As noted above, after each panel presentation there will be a brief (8 minute) period during which each group discusses how to respond to the relevant session question and the panelists’ expressed views. While the assigned respondent should already have prepared basic notes for a response, the other group members are to contribute ideas and suggestions concerning key points concerning the question and the views expressed by the panelists to help their respondent finalize the key points for the group’s response. Individual contributions include participation in helping the group’s respondent to finalize key points to present. </p><p>Recognizing the constraints of a large class, each participant is also encouraged and expected to engage thoughtfully in the open class discussions about the lecture as well as the session questions. s discussions about the lecture as well as the session questions. </p><p><i>Engagement evaluation rubric</i></p><p>Engagement includes direct engagement in all aspects of the session discussions at the Wednesday meetings, including engagement in discussion of the lecture material in the first hour, in contributing to and presenting your group’s responses to the session questions and panel presentations, and in open discussions of issues related to the session questions.</p><p>Evaluation of engagement will be based on the quality as well as the extent of contributions. Evaluation of engagement quality will take the following criteria into account:</p><ul><li>evident understanding of the concepts and issues introduced in the session involved, in the context of the concepts and issues raised in earlier sessions, and insight into the practical implications of these concepts and issues</li><li>evident familiarity with the readings and other source material</li><li>careful listening and thoughtful reflection before making comments (especially in responses to the panelists’ points)</li><li>plausible presentation of the perspective of the players being represented (especially in responses to the panelists’ points) plus recognition of and respect for the positions of others</li><li>synthesis, integration and drawing connections between and among the immediate subject matter and ideas, issues and insights from the course materials or elsewhere</li><li>accuracy and creativity in illustrating applications and implications (e.g., case examples) as appropriate</li><li>effective<i> </i>communication skills (clear, concise, credible, etc.) </li><li>special credit for wit and humour.</li></ul><p>Each participant’s class engagement (other than the panel presentation, which is graded separately) will be evaluated in two parts (sessions 1-6 and sessions 7-12), each worth 10%. Combined, the class engagement grades will represent 20% of the overall course grade.  .  </p><p><i><strong>The three briefing papers</strong></i></p><p>Submission of three papers is required. All are to be in the form of briefing papers (also often called briefing notes) to relevant individuals or organizations. These writing assignments have two purposes. The main purpose is to encourage integration of understandings gained from the readings, lectures and discussions, with particular attention to the implications for practical application. The second purpose is to provide experience in a style of writing you are likely to use as a professional. </p><p><i>Briefing paper style</i></p><p>You have all done briefing papers or briefing notes before. They are concise and carefully structured documents prepared for senior officials or other important players in assessment deliberations. The readers are assumed to have a significant need to know. But most will have quite limited overall familiarity with assessment complexities. And you can safely assume none has the time to slog through pages of text to get to some conclusion at the end. Many different particular formats are used in briefing papers, but they all focus on getting the essential information across as quickly as possible. </p><p>For the 415 briefing paper assignments, the basic structural expectations are as follows:</p><ul><li>provide a concise title identifying the topic or issue or question addressed in the paper</li><li>identify for whom the paper has been prepared (i.e., your intended readers)</li><li>in a summary box at the beginning, set out very briefly the key conclusions or take away messages </li><li>in the main body of the briefing paper, which should not exceed two pages<ul><li>set out the crucial background, including the main points of issue, </li><li>identify the response options, your evaluation of them and the grounds for your conclusions</li><li>set out your recommendations</li></ul></li><li>provide supporting evidence and evaluation details, case examples etc. in appendices following the main body of the paper (even short briefing papers, such as your first briefing paper, benefit from putting the details and background in short appendices)</li><li>in the final appendix present your bibliography for the references you have reported in the paper </li><li>if you use footnotes for details and/or referencing, format them as endnotes that appear at the end of the paper, just before the bibliography (if you include the full referencing information in endnotes, you do not need a separate bibliography).</li></ul><p>The whole paper should be designed to be easily scanned by a busy reader. That can be achieved in various ways including the following: </p><ul><li>using informative headings and subheadings </li><li>highlighting of key phrases and sentences </li><li>using text boxes for especially important concepts, examples or other points. </li></ul><p>Given the complexities involved (many different applications, players, issues, possible responses, etc.), you cannot discuss everything. In choosing what to include in the briefing papers, give particular attention to what you consider to be most significant given the assigned question, the needs of the audience, and the overall agenda of enhacing the effectiveness, fairness and efficiency of sustainability-based, next generation assessment law, policy and practice. You will have to consider carefully what is and is not crucial here.</p><p>Be clear and concise. These papers are meant to communicate essentials to very busy readers. They need key information in a format that facilitates a quick grasp of the material. However, your readers will also need necessary clarifications and evidence (or references to evidence) that support the argument and demonstrate credibility and reliability. </p><p>Remember that you are, at least implicitly, making an argument. Remember also that these are scholarly papers, expected to meet the usual expectations for sound argument, proper references and reasonable adherence to the conventions of grammar, even if you choose to rely to some extent on bulleted lists of major points. </p><p><i>Document format for submissions</i></p><p>Please post a Word version of your submission in the relevant dropbox. That makes commenting and other feedback easier.</p><p><i>Lateness</i></p><p>Late penalties will be assessed for briefing papers received after the due dates set out in the detailed instructions below for each paper. The standard penalty is 0.5 per day for the first three days and 0.25 per day thereafter (15/20 one day late becomes 14.5/20). </p><p>We will recognize that life sometimes involves illness and other crises. However, you know that too and carry some responsibility for organizing a precautionary cushion around your deadlines. Our purposes here are to approximate the real world of professional deadlines and to ensure that those who submit assignments late do not gain an unfair advantage over those who submit on time.</p><p><i>General rubric for grading the briefing papers:</i></p><p>Recognizing that each of the three briefing papers involves specific expectations that are set out in detail below, evaluation of the briefing papers will take the following criteria into account:</p><ul><li>demonstrated understanding of the course material (readings, lectures and discussions), including evident familiarity (though not necessarily agreement) with the key concepts and issues, appropriate responses or response options and their interrelations, and attention to implications for applications</li><li>clarity and coherence of response to the specifics of the particular assigned task for the briefing paper, including provision of a credible and persuasive argument, and justified conclusions/recommendations, supported by appropriate evidence and reasoning</li><li>attention to the perspectives of different interests and to the practical consequences (directly and indirectly) of your arguments and conclusions/recommendations</li><li>effectiveness of presentation, including conciseness and readability in a professional approach to writing, using (with flexibility) the briefing paper structure and style set out above, and characterized by easily comprehensible layout and text</li><li>suitable use of reliable sources and proper bibliographic referencing of sources used, including the lectures </li><li>special credit for wit and humour.</li></ul><p><i>Use of generative artificial intelligence tools</i></p><p>The use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, such as Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, <u>is not permitted in this course</u>. See the note on AI use below.</p><p><i><u>Specifics on </u><strong><u>briefing paper #1</u></strong><u>: on sustainability-based next generation assessment</u></i></p><p>The first briefing paper is a short warm-up assignment. Its purposes are</p><ul><li>to (re)familiarize you with the briefing paper style outlined above</li><li>to renew your general understanding of assessment issues and options from the previous courses</li><li>to clarify thinking about why more effective and diverse applications of sustainability-based next generation assessment should be encouraged </li><li>to prompt serious consideration of how the applications might be prioritized, organized and undertaken to enhance efficiency as well as fairness and effectiveness.</li></ul><p>The submission is to be a maximum of 1400 words, including the appendix but not including references. It is to be submitted electronically to the relevant dropbox on the course Learn website before midnight on Friday, February 7. This assignment represents 15% of the final grade.</p><p><i>The assignment</i></p><p>Set out the main reasons for expanding application of sustainability-based next generation assessment and offer recommendations concerning potential best means of ensuring these applications minimize overall demands on participants’ time and other resources while also building the credibility of assessment processes and the lasting benefits of assessed undertakings.</p><p><i>Particular requirements: </i></p><p>The briefing paper must</p><ul><li>cover the issues and materials addressed in sessions 1-4</li><li>be addressed to participants in a national workshop on the future of impact assessment law and practice, organized by the International Institute for Sustainable Development and to be held in Winnipeg in May 2025 (the participants will cover the range of assessment players you will be representing in the discussion portions of the 415 class sessions)</li><li>aim to prepare those participants for discussing the nature and general desirability of the next generation assessment package</li><li>use Canadian examples of legislated provisions and/or practical experience to explain or illustrate your points, and in doing so<ul><li>ensure at least some of the practical examples involve the issues raised by climate change, extractive industry projects and/or regional scale impacts and/or options (as was done in the big issues discussion in session 3)</li></ul></li><li>provide general recommendations for consideration by the meeting participants </li><li>use the briefing paper style outlined above and</li><li>put the 14 next gen assessment components in a list or table in an appendix.</li></ul><p>In drafting in the briefing paper, you should</p><ul><li>assume that your audience already knows something about sustainability-based next generation assessment, but will benefit from a summary of its key purposes, components and their interactions </li><li>recognize that next generation assessment expectations address matters of substance (what should be examined, what analysis should be undertaken) and matters of process (how deliberations should be organized and decisions made) that are all part of the same package</li><li>recognize that some current federal, provincial, territorial and Indigenous assessment regimes are better suited than others to deliver next generation assessment and that the qualities of two or more regimes can be combined in collaborative joint assessments of particular undertakings</li><li>consider the significance, benefits and difficulties of transition from past (and still common) approaches to impact assessment<ul><li>concerning assessments at the project and regional/strategic levels; and</li><li>concerning the diversity of assessment authorities, stakeholders and other interested parties that participate in assessments (including those in the categories you will be representing in the class engagement discussions)</li></ul></li><li>recognize that jurisdictions beyond Canada have more or less different priority concerns and capacities</li><li>ensure that, in accord with briefing paper style, <ul><li>the main body of your paper, is no more than 1000 words, </li><li>other matters (specific issues and considerations, case details, important supporting evidence, alternative response options, etc.) are referenced in the main text and presented in a concise appendix or two near the end (just before your bibliography</li><li>all components of your paper are easy for readers to scan quickly.</li></ul></li><li>see pages 10-13 above for the generic expectations and the general rubric for evaluating the briefing papers, including this one.</li></ul><p><i><u>Specifics of </u><strong><u>briefing paper #2</u></strong><u>: on complex sustainability-related cumulative effects in next generation assessment</u></i></p><p>The second briefing paper focuses on issues and materials from sessions 4-8. It entails some analysis based on your understanding of how sustainability, complexity and cumulative effects can be addressed together in sustainability-based next generation assessment applications. The briefing paper requirements centre on cumulative effects, recognizing that all cumulative effects involve the interactions of complex systems and that the most significant cumulative effects are the ones that have consequences for sustainability.</p><p>For this somewhat more ambitious briefing paper, the maximum is 2000 words, including appendices but not including references. The paper is due in the dropbox before midnight on Thursday, March 13. It represents 25% of the final grade.</p><p><i>The assignment</i></p><p>Drawing especially from the issues and materials from sessions 4-8, but also from your learning from the other core assessment diploma courses, provide recommendations and related advice on how best to identify and assess cumulative effects and their consequences in impact assessment processes in Canada. You are again to be briefing the workshop participants you advised in briefing paper #1.  Your recommendations and related advice are to be based on your answers to the following questions:</p><ul><li>what sustainability-related cumulative effects (positive and adverse) and related major issues involving interactive complex-systems can and cannot be addressed reasonably well in project-based assessments?</li><li>why?</li><li>what are the most important implications for the design and application of impact assessment processes at the project level, and for use of other means of addressing sustainability-related cumulative effects? </li></ul><p><i>Particular requirements </i></p><p>The briefing paper must </p><ul><li>cover the issues and materials addressed in sessions 4-8</li><li>be addressed to participants in the International Institute for Sustainable Development’s May 2025 national workshop on the future of impact assessment law and practice (with participants covering the full range of assessment players represented by the 415 class groups)</li><li>adopt and apply an approach to cumulative effects that is informed by sustainability-based objectives, the realities of complex social and ecological systems and their interactions, the importance of respect for uncertainty and precaution in assessments, and needs for assessments to help identify and find ways to manage positive and adverse cumulative effects</li><li>make use of examples from any project assessment cases you are familiar with – from the course materials or beyond – relying mostly on Canadian cases</li><li>give particular attention to implications for maximizing the efficiency as well as effectiveness and fairness of assessments. </li></ul><p>In drafting in the briefing paper, you should</p><ul><li>assume that the readers of this briefing paper have already read your first briefing paper on sustainability-based next generation assessment and will need only a basic recapitulation</li><li>adhere to briefing paper style expectations, recognizing that the main body of this paper, like your previous one, should be no more than 1000 words, leaving the remaining 1250 words for numbered appendices covering specifics (particular issues, options and considerations, case details, supporting evidence, alternative response options, etc.)<ul><li>as in briefing paper #1, the appendix material should be concise, easy to scan and clearly flagged in relevant places in the main body of the paper and</li></ul></li><li>remember that the generic expectations and the general rubric for evaluating the briefing papers (pages 11-12, above) apply to this briefing paper, but with a more generous word count limit.</li></ul><p><i><u>Specifics of </u><strong><u>briefing paper #3</u></strong><u>: on collaborative multi-jurisdictional assessment at the regional/strategic and project levels, including Indigenous authorities</u></i></p><p>The final briefing paper is to draw from the materials and learning from the whole course but with emphasis on sessions 9-12. In it, you are to prepare recommendations for negotiators developing an accord to facilitate assessment collaboration where multiple jurisdictions are involved.</p><p>In particular, your briefing paper is to inform initial work on a more specific objective – establishing a common framework for multi-jurisdictional collaboration in regions where linked regional/strategic and project-level assessments are needed. Your recommendations are to be based on application of sustainability-based next generation assessment principles and your evaluation of the final terms of reference for the Ring of Fire Regional Assessment. The context, intended recipients and specific requirements for the briefing paper are set out below.</p><p>This briefing paper is limited to 2250 words, including appendices. It is to be submitted electronically to the course Learn website before midnight on Thursday, April 10. This assignment represents 30% of the final grade.</p><p><i>The context</i></p><p>The briefing paper is to inform hypothetical national negotiations aimed at upward harmonization of Canada’s many jurisdiction-based assessment requirements and processes. The intended eventual result would be alignment of the many different assessment laws and processes in Canada – federal, provincial, territorial and Indigenous – to facilitate multi-jurisdictional collaboration and to be more consistent, more effective, and easier and less costly for everyone to understand and apply. Any common foundation for harmonized assessments in Canada would have to be flexible enough to accommodate the different assessment needs and priorities of the various jurisdictions, while also incorporating the generic set of sustainability-based next generation assessment components and relationships.</p><p>A key immediate focus of the negotiations is to reach agreement on a common national framework for collaborative multi-jurisdictional regional/strategic and project level assessments in particular regions. That framework would guide development of case-specific terms of reference for multi-jurisdictional collaboration in particular regions where linked regional/strategic and project-level assessments are needed. </p><p>The case-specific multi-jurisdictional collaborations on regional/strategic and project-level assessments would be appropriate where </p><ul><li>future project-level assessments and associated cumulative effects are anticipated</li><li>the relevant issues and options involve the authority and responsibilities of two or more jurisdictions</li><li>a collaborative multi-jurisdictional approach would offer a more effective, fair and efficient attention to overall regional/strategic issues and options.</li></ul><p>As part of a larger initiative for upward harmonization of Canadian assessment regimes, a common national framework for collaborative multi-jurisdictional regional/strategic and project level assessments would need to</p><ul><li>cover the jurisdictional responsibilities of all the federal, provincial, territorial and/or Indigenous authorities involved</li><li>integrate or coordinate the relevant regional/strategic and project-level planning, assessment and related approval and follow-up processes that would otherwise be undertaken separately by the jurisdictions involved</li><li>apply sustainability-based next generation assessment principles.</li></ul><p>To be clear, three levels of agreement are involved:</p><ul><li>a national accord establishing a basic standard for upward harmonization of assessment laws and processes in Canada, including for multi-jurisdictional applications</li><li>a national agreement establishing a common framework for developing case-specific terms of reference for collaborative multi-jurisdictional regional/strategic and project level assessments in particular regions</li><li>case-specific terms of reference for collaborative multi-jurisdictional regional/strategic and project level assessments in particular regions</li></ul><p>All are to incorporate sustainability-based next-generation assessment principles.</p><p>In this context, your assignment is chiefly meant to inform negotiations on the common framework in the second level of agreement above. However, your recommendations should </p><p>respect the next generation assessment principles that guide the first level and anticipate application at the third level (as informed by experience with the actual terms of reference for the Ring of Fire Regional Assessment). </p><p><i>The assignment</i></p><p>Provide well-supported recommendations to the negotiators of the common framework for developing case-specific terms of reference for collaborative multi-jurisdictional regional/strategic and project level assessments in particular regions. The recommendations must reflect attention to the particular requirements set out below. </p><p>The briefing paper is to be addressed to the negotiators of the common framework, who would be representatives of the relevant Canadian jurisdictions (federal, provincial, territorial and Indigenous) that have assessment authority and related processes.  You should also anticipate that many other assessment participants would be interested in your recommendations and reasoning.</p><p><i>Particular requirements</i></p><p>In the briefing paper, you must </p><ul><li>outline the essential contents (topics covered and key points) of case-specific terms of reference for collaborative multi-jurisdictional assessments linking regional/strategic and project-level deliberations and decision making</li><li>recognize that every case-specific terms of reference would</li><li>establish a framework of linked multi-jurisdictional regional/strategic and project level assessment objectives and process components in the particular region</li><li>cover the jurisdictional responsibilities of all the federal, provincial, territorial and Indigenous authorities involved</li><li>cover regional/strategic and project-level deliberations and decision making and their links</li><li>integrate or coordinate the main relevant planning, assessment and related approval and follow-up processes that would otherwise be undertaken separately by the jurisdictions involved</li><li>address matters of substance (what issues and options should be examined, what analysis should be undertaken) and matters of process (how deliberations should be organized, who should be involved and how decisions should be made) in sustainability-based next generation assessment</li><li>incorporate, to the extent possible in a briefing paper, attention to the full suite of next generation assessment components and associated topics considered in the course, recognizing that the components are interdependent and should be mutually reinforcing; </li><li>include an evaluation of the terms of reference for Ring of Fire Regional Assessment, <ul><li>recognizing that it is not a perfect model (e.g., Ontario is not included as one of the participating jurisdictions) and is focused only on regional/strategic assessment rather than tiered regional/strategic and project assessments</li><li>using the sustainability-based next generation assessment components and approaches as core considerations in your evaluation</li><li>summarizing your key findings </li><li>setting out the major implications for multi-jurisdictional regional collaboration agreements in other regions (other otherwise demonstrating how and where the implications have been incorporated in your discussion of what’s needed in the common framework for case-specific multi-jurisdictional collaboration agreements)</li></ul></li><li>provide recommendations for attention in the common framework for case-specific multi-jurisdictional collaboration agreements </li><li>explain how collaborative assessments under the common framework should maximize the effectiveness, fairness and efficiency of assessments and the undertakings they address</li><li>adhere (with some flexibility) to briefing paper style (see page 11).</li></ul><p>Note that the listing of mandatory elements above does <u>not</u> indicate the order in which they should be addressed in the briefing paper.</p>

The following text is recommended:<br/><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/ about/equity-office3 </p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview.

ERS 415 aims to foster the independent development and application of advanced individual capacities that are increasing needed in the world. These include capacities for assessing diverse perspectives, anticipating complex and interactive effects, undertaking informed critical analysis, and designing and pursuing transformative innovations – all of which depend on understanding and foresight. GenAI tools tools have neither. </p><p>The products of ChatGPT and other GenAI tools are often unreliable, for example because the sources used can be out of date, the ability to recognize accurate supporting evidence is weak, and the tool itself has no capacity for critical judgment. More importantly, reliance upon these tools cripples personal development of the needed capacities. </p><p>Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee</a>.</p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources">Student Success Office</a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management;</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students">Writing and Communication Centre</a> for assignments with writing or presentations;</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students">AccessAbility Services</a> for documented accommodations; and</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide">Library</a> for research-based assignments.</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
