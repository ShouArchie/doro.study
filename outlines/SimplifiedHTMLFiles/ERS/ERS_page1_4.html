  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ERS 102:</div>
<p>Focusing on the relationship between complexity and energy in bio-physical, ecological and social contexts, we review  trends in 'Big History' as it has unfolded from the Big Bang to the Internet. <br/>The course explores the implications of this 'deep-time' perspective for our understanding of the great challenge of sustainability.</p>

<p>The previous course description, reproduced above, has been updated as follows, upon consultation with ERSSA and ERS students and professors: </p><p><i><strong>All human societies harbour stories about the origin of the universe and their place in it. These accounts include those of Indigenous Peoples, the world’s religions, and natural science. To help students navigate these worldviews and clarify their own, this course surveys “Big History,” the scientific story of the astounding 15-billion-year evolution of physical, living, and social systems. By deepening students’ understanding of the “environment” and humanity’s place in it, this survey provides a grounding for later courses focused on sustainability.</strong></i></p><p>Each of us must find our place in this wondrous, unfolding universe and I'm excited about the opportunity to join you on this journey of discovery. Please do your part by fully engaging with this material--which can be life-changing.</p><p>This course runs in parallel with ERS101, which is also offered in winter term, so Dr. de Loe and I have made efforts to coordinate the courses. We'll both use the same program, Perusall, for course readings. We adopt complementary approaches to writing pedagogy: you'll practice drafting and reflecting in this course in contrast to fine-tuning for a professional audience in ERS101. Finally, the worldview reflection in this course sets a larger context for the discussions in ERS101 of your "superpower" and undergraduate path.</p>

<p>This section provides a brief overview of assessment in ERS102. Further information, including rubrics, will be provided in lecture/tutorial and in LEARN.</p><p>I have designed the course so that the learning outcomes will be attained through regular activities that will help to prepare you for the course assessments (e.g., final exam, final worldview reflection). Assessment will occur in a variety of ways to suit different learning styles. </p><p><strong>Attendance and participation: Lectures and field trips (20% = 10 lectures x 1.5% each + 2 field trips x 2.5% each)</strong><br/>It’s important to attend and actively participate in the weekly lectures because they will build on the readings, address your comments/questions from Perusall, and provide opportunities to further engage with your classmates and the course topics. You are thus expected to attend the lectures and participate in all activities in the interest of attaining the course learning outcomes. The main metric of your participation will be through regular Vevox polls, which also facilitate collaborative learning. There are eleven lectures, but your lowest grade will be dropped; you may thus miss one lecture for any reason without affecting your grade (i.e., you don't even need to contact us), though of course it may affect your understanding of that course content. For any subsequent missed lectures (or for missed field trips), your grade will be zero unless your absence is covered under UW policy related to illness, religion/creed and/or non-illness related extenuating circumstances and you follow the appropriate process (see below).</p><p><strong>Attendance and participation: Tutorials (15% = 10 tutorials x 1.5% each)</strong><br/>The tutorials are also central to meeting the course learning outcomes. The tutorials will deepen your understanding of course material through review, discussion and small-group activities. You must attend your assigned tutorial session and actively participate; your TA will assign your grade based on your preparedness, engagement, attitude and completion of activities. There are eleven tutorials, but your lowest grade will be dropped; you may thus miss one tutorial for any reason without affecting your grade (i.e., you don't even need to contact us). For any subsequent missed lectures (or for missed field trips), your grade will be zero unless your absence is covered under UW policy related to illness, religion/creed and/or non-illness related extenuating circumstances and you follow the appropriate process (see below).</p><p><strong>Bonus (2%)</strong><br/>By the Friday evening before lecture, please send me the name of a song that you like that relates to ERS102 and the topic of the coming week – and briefly explain how it relates. I will play one of those you send at the beginning of class and if it’s yours you get a bonus (maximum of once in the term). </p><p><strong>Final exam (20%)</strong><br/>The final exam will be held in class during the final lecture period on April 1, and you must be available for it. Any material from the course could be covered on the exam, which thus provides a summative assessment of learning outcomes (#1-3). The exam will consist of multiple choice, definitional, fill-in-the blank, true-and-false, short-answer and/or long-answer questions that will assess your understanding of course material at various levels. Further details will be provided beforehand. </p><p><strong>Readings in Perusall (20% = 10 weeks x 2% each)</strong><br/>Both ERS101 and ERS102 will utilize a collaborative reading tool, Perusall. In Perusall, you will read documents, add comments/questions and interact with your classmates—and your engagement with the readings in these ways will be graded. Required readings will be posted, by week, to the course’s Perusall site. <u>You must read and engage with the assigned readings by 11:59 pm on the Sunday prior to the corresponding lecture</u> (to allow time for me to review your comments before lecture). These readings are essential to your learning (supporting all learning outcomes). Further information will be provided in lecture.</p><p><strong>Reflection notebook (10%)</strong><br/>You should have your reflection notebook with you for all lectures and tutorials this term because there will be regular prompts for you to write. Your regular writing in this notebook meets learning outcome #5 in the interest of two main purposes: i) practice with ‘freewriting,’ which is so important as an initial stage in effective writing (as will be explained in lecture) and ii) opportunity for reflection, which is critical during a mind-expanding course such as ERS102. It will also support your worldview reflection and be another way to evaluate your attendance and participation in lectures and tutorials. Your TA will assign your grade through a spot-check in Weeks 6 and 11 (see schedule above). Note that your TA will <u>not</u> read your writing—to allow you space to be forthright and to protect your privacy—but they will flip through it in your presence to ensure its integrity and to measure the amount. The grading scheme will be generous (i.e., you can attain full marks just by doing the writing). To facilitate grading, though, you must i) write within an APP Coil Exercise Book (1-subject lined), available at the W-Store (see course materials, above); ii) number the pages; and iii) begin each writing session with a clear heading indicating location (lecture, tutorial, or other), date and time. Further details will be provided.</p><p><strong>Worldview reflection (15%) </strong><br/>This is a two-part assignment to address learning outcome #4. Early in the term, you will provide a short reflection on your worldview. Near the end of the term, you will reflect on it again—and update as appropriate—in the context of learning about big history in ERS102. The assignments will be equally weighted and due in LEARN at 11:59PM on January 31 and March 21, 2025, respectively. Further details will be provided.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office</p><p><strong>Assignment submission, deadlines, extensions</strong>: Please refer to the course schedule and LEARN documents for detailed instructions on submission of assignments. Note that you must complete assignments and quizzes on your own, unless we specify otherwise; otherwise, we are required by UW policy to report cheating/unauthorized collaboration as a violation of academic integrity (see below).<br/>     For all assignments there is an automatic extended deadline available to you. You have 48hrs to submit your assignment with no late penalty. After that initial 48hrs, the late penalty will be 5% for every 24hrs late, to a maximum of four days. After four days, the assignment will no longer be accepted (your grade will be 0), unless covered by UW policy on absences (see below).</p><p><strong>Digital distraction</strong>: You may wish to use your laptop during class sessions. However, you must do so professionally; i.e., use your device only for note-taking for ERS102. Checking email, browsing web sites, shopping, posting comments on social media, etc. during class time is unprofessional. The literature documents that it not only disrupts your learning but it rudely distracts those around you so please be considerate and abstain during class time.</p><p><strong>Email policy: </strong>Email is an excellent way to contact me. However, for questions that apply to the class as a whole (i.e., others would benefit from the answer), please post to the discussion forum. I will aim to respond to forum posts and emails within 24hrs, except over weekends and during the winter break; if I don't respond to a forum post, please send an email to obtain a faster response. Note that email is the official channel of communication between the University and its students. You are required to check your <i>uwaterloo.ca </i>email account regularly (and to ensure those emails are forwarded elsewhere if that's your preference).</p><p><strong>Generative AI:</strong> The use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is <u>not</u> permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). <br/>     You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. <br/>     In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> <br/>     Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management; <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations; <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations; and the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments.</p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/>     Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/>     Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/>     Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
