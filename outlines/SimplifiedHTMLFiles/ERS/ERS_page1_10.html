  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ERS 245:</div>
<p>This course provides an overview of the interdisciplinary perspectives and approaches required to sustainably use and protect biodiversity from local to global scales. Diverse cases and examples are drawn from Canada and internationally to explore a range of conservation approaches, including Indigenous approaches to stewardship. A focus on key trends in biodiversity loss and recovery in Canada (and globally), including the role of climate change, will be combined with an understanding of biodiversity governance and the need to examine biodiversity conservation efforts in the context of resource extraction and sustainability debates.</p>

<p>Quizzes: There are three quizzes. Each quiz has 40 questions which are multiple choice and true/false. All three quizzes are mandatory, but your grade will reflect your best two of three. Further information on quizzes and requirements related to the quizzes is available on the course LEARN site.</p><p>Multi-Part Project: As partial fulfillment of course requirements, you will be creating a policy brief on a key biodiversity conservation issue. You will keep the same topic throughout the project. The policy brief will take the form of a “placemat”. A policy placement is a clear and concise summary of a complex issue presented to a key decision maker to help them make choices about biodiversity that will be in the public interest. The Placemat Assignment has two parts and will be completed over multiple weeks. Details are available on the course LEARN site. </p>

<h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p><h3>Student Resources</h3><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessibility/">AccessAbility Services</a>: Located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, provides academic support for University of Waterloo students who have both permanent and temporary disabilities. AccessAbility Services collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register at the beginning of each academic term.</p><h3>Late Policies</h3><p>Please plan your academic work carefully, keeping in mind the deadlines for assignments in all your courses. Complete assignments on time, according to deadlines in the Course Schedule.</p><p>As a student, you may encounter situations such as significant illnesses, ongoing medical conditions, or other circumstances that prevent you from meeting academic obligations.</p><p>Contact the course instructor (e.g., by email) before or within 48 hours of a test, exam or due date.</p><p>Written assignments submitted past the due date without any prior consultation with the instructor will be subject to a grading penalty of 5% of the value of the assignment per day, including Saturday and Sunday. Assignments submitted more than 5 days after the due date will receive a grade of 0 unless a longer extension was approved.</p><p>Missed quizzes will be marked as zero unless there is an agreement in place with the instructor to accommodate a different schedule. No make-up quizzes will be allowed in the absence of prior communication with the instructor. </p><p>See the department policies below for further information regarding absences requiring academic considerations.</p><h3>Assignment Regrade</h3><p>Grading is based on the marking rubrics posted to the LEARN site. You have 14 days (including weekends) from the time the grade appears on LEARN to appeal a grade. You should contact the instructor to first discuss the mark.  Should you still like a regrade you are to email the Professor with a formal request and provide any relevant material.  Please note that the entire assignment/exam will be re-marked (not just the portion in question). Your assignment is marked as an individual effort and therefore, is unique and is marked as such. Comparison to assignments of colleagues is not sufficient grounds for a regrade, and if assignments are so similar, there may be issues of academic integrity.</p><h3>Anti-racism Statement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at equity@uwaterloo.ca or through their website: › <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/</a></p><h3>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)</h3><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources">Student Success Office</a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students">Writing and Communication Centre</a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students">AccessAbility Services</a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide">Library</a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h3>Religious Observances</h3><p>Students need to inform the instructor at the beginning of term if special accommodation needs to be made for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and assignments.</p><h3>Department Policies</h3><p> </p>
