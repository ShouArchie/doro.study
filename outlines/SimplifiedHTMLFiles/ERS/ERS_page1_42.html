  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ERS 669:</div>
<p>This course covers study design, and data management, visualization, and statistical analysis. The primary focus will be the development and understanding of generalized linear models as they are foundational to most analyses in Environment and Ecology. Students will learn to fit models to data and assess model fit. Students will also be introduced to the use of the statistical software R and provided the opportunity to use that software to manage and analyze their own data. Special topics will be developed based on the needs and interests of the students and may include hierarchical modelling, multivariate statistics, survey analysis, non-linear modelling, or other topics. Students are expected to bring their own computer and data. For cases in which data have not been collected, students will work with the professor to source similar data or generate simulated data to support their progress through the course.</p>

<p>This is a new course and the Calendar Description<i> </i>is<i> mostly accurate</i>. We have removed the focus on the students specific thesis data. The last sentence has been revised to "Students may be provided the opportunity to work with their thesis data if those data have been collected and are congruent with course learning outcomes and objectives."</p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p><i><strong>One of my main goals in developing this course was to produce a somewhat bespoke course that meets the particular needs of the graduate students enrolled in the class. Therefore, you will be provided many opportunities to work with your research data (or similar). The goal is for you to make progress on your analysis and develop content directly relevant to your graduate research project. Given the diverse needs of students in the class, this means we will have to be somewhat flexible with the course outline and adapt to where students are in their data management, analysis, and programming journey.</strong></i> The core of the course provides the knowledge and skills that are fundamental to almost all quantitative research in Environment and Ecology. Additionally, this is only the second offering of the course, so we will learn together how long it takes students to understand concepts, develop assignment deliverables, and learn the hard skills of R programming to manage data, fit models, visualize inputs and outputs, and communicate findings. Therefore, it is best to consider the timelines presented in this course outline as my best guess. I have been teaching graduate-level mixed-methods and R programming at the undergraduate level for 10 years (so the "best guess" should be close) but we will likely need to be somewhat flexible and adapt throughout the course.</p><p>We meet for one three hour session per week. I envision each session broken into three 50 minute sections (providing two 10 minute breaks throughout). The focus of each of the three sections will vary each week depending on our progress through the course material. However, the general structure will include: 1) lecture content, 2) lab content, and 3) student research. The <i>lecture content</i> will provide the knowledge and theoretical background for each topic. The <i>lab content</i> will be based on the book developed by Dr. Fedy that presents hands-on applications of the week's topic and implementation in R statistical software. The <i>student research</i> section will be opportunities for the students to focus on assignments, data and to provide time for programming, discussion, and problem-solving.</p><p>Assignment due dates are subject to change based on class progress through the course. Any revisions in due dates will be discussed as a group during class time.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>WEEK</td><td>Lecture</td><td>Lab</td><td>Assignments</td></tr><tr><td>1.

<p>All assignment descriptions and associated rubrics will be available through LEARN. All assignments must be submitted through the associated Dropbox on LEARN. The first three assignments will involve peer assessment. Details on the peer assessment process will be provided in class. For all assignments involving programming in R, I will expect the documents will be prepared as a Markdown file. Additionally, students are welcome to help each other with all programming aspects. However, students are expected to work independently for all written components (i.e., not programming scripts).</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
