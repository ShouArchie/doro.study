<p><strong><u>Detailed Description:</u></strong></p><p>We will examine the globalization of food and agricultural systems and the various mechanisms that have arisen to govern it at the global level. Topics for discussion include food security and food sovereignty, food crises, the historical trajectory of the globalization of the industrial agricultural model, and food system governance models. We will also examine the current forces driving change in the global food system, including corporate concentration, financialization, land grabbing, supply chain governance, advances in genetic engineering/cellular agriculture, and the rise of digital agriculture. We will also consider the governance challenges associated with the ecological dimensions of food systems, as well the future of sustainability in food systems, particularly via debates over agroecology vs. other models. We will explore these various themes through a close reading of recent academic articles and papers that engage with these topics.</p>

<p><strong>Reading Responses: </strong>Four times during the term, you are to write an ‘editorial’ about the ideas presented in the assigned readings for that week. Each of these papers should be approximately 750-1000 words long (1.5 to two pages single spaced), not including references. These papers are each worth 10% of your course mark. The schedule for these response papers will be determined in the first class. For each of these papers, you should develop an argument or main point that you would like to convey about the readings, and you are welcome to use the discussion questions introduced in class the week prior to shape your argument. Your reading response paper should include a short introduction that outlines your main argument(s), and the rest of the paper should back up your points, in an organized way, by explaining your reasoning and referencing the readings. You will be expected to present the main argument from your paper (3-4 minutes) in class on the days that you write response papers. <u>Full instructions on the response papers will be posted separately</u>. </p><p><strong>Policy/Analysis Brief:</strong> You are to write a policy or analysis brief on a key issue in global food and agriculture governance. Your topic should be chosen before reading week. The brief should be approximately 3500 words in length (not including references). This paper is worth 30% of your course mark. For this paper, you should include a background to the issue and the dynamics surrounding it. You should also present the key debates associated with your topic and provide your own analysis and/or policy suggestions. Your paper should include references, including at least 10 references to assigned course readings. Your additional sources should be varied – from academic articles and books, official websites, and NGO websites. The use of generative AI is strictly prohibited for this assignment. Be prepared to show all your work including early drafts if requested. <u>Full instructions on this assignment – including a list of topics from which to choose – will be posted separately. </u>This paper is due April 4, 2025, to the LEARN dropbox.</p><p><strong>Policy/Analysis Brief Outline: </strong>You are to prepare a 2-page outline that provides a sketch of your topic, research question, structure, preliminary recommendations, and sources for your policy/analysis brief. This outline is worth 5% of your final course mark. The outline is due March 5<sup>th</sup>, 2025, to the LEARN dropbox. <u>Full instructions on this outline will be posted with the policy/analysis brief instructions.</u></p><p><strong>Policy/Analysis brief presentation:</strong> You will present your policy/analysis brief to the class in the last two weeks of class (you will have approximately 10-15 minutes for this presentation). This presentation is worth 5% of your final course mark. You should be organized, clear, and persuasive in presenting your work. You may use PowerPoint if you wish, but it is not required. <u>Full instructions on this presentation will be posted with the policy/analysis brief instructions.</u></p><p><strong>Class Participation</strong>: You are expected to be present at all class meetings, to complete all of the readings, and to participate in all class discussions. Class participation is worth 20% of your final course mark. As noted above, on weeks when you write a reading response paper, you are expected to present it orally in class (you have 3-4 minutes to convey the main ideas from your paper). Twice during the term, you will be expected to provide an overview of one of the articles assigned for that week at the start of class (3-4 minutes). Once during the term, you will be designated (along with one other student) as a leading ‘discussant’ for that class, meaning that you are expected to make interventions that react to/pose questions about the response papers that were written for that week and outline key questions you would like the class to discuss in that session. The schedule for these roles will be determined in advance. Good participation is not simply a matter of speaking out in class. It involves contributions that demonstrate your engagement and connection with the course readings. It is important to demonstrate that you have carefully weighed the arguments and viewpoints expressed in the readings and in class in making your own interventions. A deduction of 1% from the final course grade will be made (up to a maximum of 5) for any seminar not attended without prior notification and a valid excuse. </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
