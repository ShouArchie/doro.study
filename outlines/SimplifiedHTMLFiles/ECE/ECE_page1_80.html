<p>Designers of building blocks often ignore the motivation behind the various specifications they are given and their connections with the overall system performance once integrated into a radio communication system. This frequently translates into a lack of global optimization, which sacrifices the best performance that could have been achieved. As radio and wireless systems pose increasingly stringent specifications, integration of component-level building blocks to system-level design process is essential and circuit design and radio system engineering will merge. Therefore, it is crucial to train future designers with system-level knowledge. </p><p>This course covers a wide range of radio and wireless systems aspects including communication signals and the underlying modulation and multiple access techniques, tradeoffs among different transceiver (transmitter/receiver) architectures (conventional and modern), antennas and radio waves propagation, and design considerations of RF/microwave building blocks, radio and wireless systems. In particular, it links circuit design specifications and system requirements defined in wireless standards. </p>
