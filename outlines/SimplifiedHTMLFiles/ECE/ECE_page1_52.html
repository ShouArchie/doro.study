  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>In-person sessions</p><p><strong>Emergency remote-teaching contingency</strong></p><p>Live sessions will be held on MS Teams during scheduled course times. To allow students to ask questions and participate freely, live sessions will not be recorded.</p><p>Assessments</p><p><strong>Quiz policy</strong></p><p>There will be an unspecified number of pop-up quizzes during the class. Each student is allowed to miss up to 10% of the total quizzes without providing any justification.</p><p><strong>Assignment policy</strong></p><p>There will be 3 assignments each with roughly 5 problems. Solutions will be graded on both accuracy and presentation. A correct solution that is poorly presented may not receive full marks.</p><p>Late submissions will be accepted with 15% penalty per day for only two days after the due date (the same policy is applied to project proposals and final reports).</p><p>Students can discuss the class material with other students. Students also can discuss with others about how to formulate assignment problems. However, students must write down their solutions by themselves. In particular, students may not take notes while they discuss assignments with others.</p><p>Any suspected plagiarism or infractions of this honor code will be reported to the appropriate Associate Dean.</p><p><strong>Emergency remote-final-examination contingency</strong></p><p>In the event of an emergency, the final exam will be a take-home exam.</p><p>Auditing</p><p>All students are welcome to audit the course unofficially without any requirements. However, for the audit to be officially recorded on their transcript, students must enroll in the course on Quest as an audit, attend the lectures, take the final exam, and achieve a minimum score of 30%.</p><p>Projects</p><p><strong>Undergrad survey project</strong></p><p>For the survey project, students will review existing literature (at least three major papers) in a subarea of multi-agent systems and possibly explore open research questions in that subarea. There will be 2 milestones during the term: proposal (15%) and final written report (85%).</p><p><strong>Proposal for undergrads</strong></p><p>In the project proposal, students should explain the subarea that will be surveyed and the significance of the research papers in the subarea. If necessary, the course instructor can help with finding topics. Each proposal should include all the following.</p><ul><li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Introduce and motivate the subarea</li><li><strong>Related work:</strong> Overview the state-of-the-art by citing significant research papers</li></ul><p>Undergraduate students can choose the graduate grading scheme when they submit their proposals. Those who decide to go with the graduate grading scheme have to follow the proposal format outlined below for grad students.</p><p><strong>Final report for undergrads</strong></p><p>In the final report, each student is expected to submit a written survey paper. The survey paper, as the name suggests, should provide a comprehensive survey of research papers in the proposed subarea. The paper should provide a critical assessment of the work that has been done in the subarea listing strengths and weaknesses of the existing work. The paper should also include an overview of some of the open research problems in the subarea. If applicable, brief comparisons between (or categorization of) the presented research papers should also be provided. The source for descriptions of existing research work is normally a collection of research papers presented at respected international conferences and in well-known international journals.</p><p>The paper should follow the same format described below for grad students. Without references, each survey report should not be less than 7 and not more than 18 pages.</p><p><strong>Grad research project</strong></p><p>For graduate students, an important part of this course is the research project. For the research project, students can work on the research project alone or in a team of at most three students; of course, teams are expected to work on more significant projects.</p><p>The goal of the research project is to try to do something novel, rather than merely a survey of existing work. Projects may be theoretical, experimental (based on simulations), experimental (based on real-world data), a useful software artifact, or any combination thereof. Creativity is encouraged. The only real constraint for the project is that it has to have something to do with the material covered in the course. Students are encouraged to talk to the course instructor if you are not sure about whether something is an appropriate project.</p><p>The final product is a writeup (in the form of a short research paper). Some projects may well lead to publishable papers (perhaps with some additional work). There will be 3 milestones during the course: proposal (15%), oral progress report (optional), and final written report (85%).</p><p><strong>Proposal for grads</strong></p><p>In the project proposal, students should explain the topic of their project, what types of results they hope to obtain, and what some of the technical issues are that you will need to address. For graduate students, the course project could be related to their own ongoing research as long as it also has clear connections with the course material. If necessary, the course instructor can help with finding topics. Each proposal should include all the following.</p><ul><li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Introduce and motivate the project</li><li><strong>Problem statement:</strong> Describe the purpose and the objective(s) of the project</li><li><strong>Methodology:</strong> Describe methods and tools that will be deployed to tackle the problem</li><li><strong>Related work:</strong> Overview the state-of-the-art by citing related research papers, ideally published recently in top-tier conferences or journals</li></ul><p><strong>Progress report for grads</strong></p><p>Intermediate oral project progress report is optional. This report should explain what results each group has obtained already, what (if any) difficulties the group has encountered, and what the group plans to do to complete the project. Ideally, at this point, each group should already have some good results, so that it can spend the rest of the time on answering questions generated by the results, as well as preparing the writeup.</p><p><strong>Final report for grads</strong></p><p>Each group will have to prepare and submit a final project report by the end of the term using the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM Master Article Template</a>. For Microsoft Word, students should use the interim layout.docx, and for Latex they should use the sample-sigconf.tex file in the samples folder. Submitted reports with any other format/style <strong>will not be accepted</strong>.</p><p> </p><p>Each report has to include (at least) the following sections: abstract, introduction, methodology, experimental results (if applicable), related work, conclusion, and references. Without references, each report should not be less than 5 and not more than 11 pages.</p>
