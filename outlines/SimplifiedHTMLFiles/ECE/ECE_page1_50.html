<div>
<div>
<div>ECE 488:</div>
<p>Review of feedback control design fundamentals; SISO controller parameterizations; the fundamental effect of MIMO interaction; introduction to state-space models in continuous and discrete time; SISO techniques for MIMO design; optimal control; model-predictive control design; state estimation; decoupling, MIMO PID control design; applications in areas such as aerospace systems.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Course pre-requisites:</strong></p><ol><li>This course builds on classical control theory from a first control course (ECE380, MTE360, BME356, SYDE352, or equivalent).</li><li>I assume you have good working knowledge of Laplace transforms, transfer functions, Bode plots, block diagrams, and basic control tools (Routh-Hurwitz stability test, root locus plots, Nyquist plots, design of PID/lead/lag controllers).  We quickly review these topics in Chapter 2.</li><li>I assume you have some experience with Matlab.</li></ol><p><strong>Course objectives:  </strong>There are two main course objectives:</p><ol><li>To better understand how feedback control “works” and, specifically, to understand limitations on what can be achieved with feedback control.</li><li>To develop tools that allow us to analyze and design control systems that have multiple inputs and/or multiple outputs.</li></ol><p><strong>In-person vs online learning:</strong>  To give students maximum flexibility, this year I am running the lectures and tutorials both in-person and online.  The same content is covered in both environments, and you can choose whichever works best for you.  However, the tests and the final exam are in person.</p><ul><li><strong>In-person learning:</strong>  The in-person class schedule is listed above.  See also the detailed Course Schedule below.</li><li><strong>Online learning:</strong>  A series of pre-recorded lecture videos and tutorial videos are available on LEARN.  You will need to be disciplined to keep up with the videos.  To help you, the Course Schedule below lists which videos you should go through each week.</li></ul><p> </p>

<div>
<p><strong>Tests and final exam</strong></p><ul><li><u>Dates</u>:  There are two 60-minute tests, both held during tutorial slots as indicated in the Course Schedule above.  The final exam will be centrally scheduled by the Registrar's Office.</li><li><u>Assigned seating</u> is used, with seating details available at <a href="https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/teaching/schedule">https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/teaching/schedule</a> about a week before each test or final exam.</li><li><u>Permitted aids</u>:  In addition to a non-programmable calculator, you may prepare and bring <u>one</u> double-sided handwritten aid sheet (on normal 8.5 x 11 inch paper) to each test, and <u>two</u> double-sided handwritten aid sheets (on normal 8.5 x 11 inch paper) to the final exam.  Full test and exam rules will be provided no later than one week before the test or exam date.</li><li><u>Rule about collaboration</u>:  The tests and the final exam must be done individually.</li><li><u>Weightings of the two tests</u>:  For each student, assuming both tests are written, the lower-score test is worth 10% and the higher-score test is worth 20%.</li><li><u>Missed tests</u>:  No make-up or alternatively-scheduled tests are being offered in this course.  If one of the two tests is missed due to severe illness (either self-declared covid-related or otherwise verified by a Verification of Illness form), or due to a self-declared short-term absence on Quest (one of the two days must overlap the test date), or other extreme circumstances approved by the course instructor, either (depending on whatever is best for the student) the weight of the final exam is increased by 10% and the test that is written is worth 20%, or the weight of the final exam is increased by 20% and the test that is written is worth 10%.  If both tests are missed due to severe illness (either self-declared covid-related or otherwise verified by a Verification of Illness form), or due to a self-declared short-term absence on Quest (one of the two days must overlap one of the test dates), or other extreme circumstances approved by the course instructor, the weight of the final exam is increased by 30%.  Any reason for missing a test, other than those listed above, results in a score of zero on that test.</li></ul><p><strong>Project exercises  </strong></p><ul><li><u>General information</u>:  This course has a set of six Project Exercises, denoted P1-P6, that you will work on throughout the term.  Instructions are provided at the ends of Chapters 2-5.  The purpose of the Project Exercises is to increase your understanding of the techniques and ideas presented in the lectures by applying them to a quasi-realistic system.  By working through the Project Exercises, you will also increase your familiarity with Matlab and learn to appreciate limitations of such software.</li><li><u>Report requirements</u>:  See the course notes (page 97).</li><li><u>Submission location and date</u>:  Submit in the relevant LEARN dropbox by 11:59pm (Waterloo time).  Deadlines are included in the Course Schedule table above.</li><li><u>Late submission policy</u>:  Any project exercise that is up to 48 hours late will receive a 1 mark (out of the possible 3 marks) reduction.  Any project exercise that is more than 48 hours late scores zero.  Late penalties may be waived at the course instructor's discretion, but only in cases of severe illness (either self-declared covid related or otherwise verified by a Verification of Illness form), or if a student submits a self-declared short-term absence on Quest (one of the two days must overlap the submission deadline), or in other extreme extenuating circumstances approved by the course instructor.  In no case will a submission be accepted more than 4 days after the due date.</li><li><u>Project Exercise grading</u>:  A marking rubric for each Project Exercise is included in the course notes (page 97).  Each Project Exercise is graded out of 3 marks.  The overall project will be graded out of 15, so it is possible to lose up to 3 marks and still get the full 15/15 on the overall project.  However, you cannot get more than 15/15.  The project exercises are worth 20% of the final course grade.</li><li><u>Allowable collaboration/aids:</u><ul><li>Please ask me or the TA if you need help with anything associated with the Project Exercises.</li><li>You are also free (in fact, encouraged) to discuss anything about the Project Exercises with other students in the current ECE488 class, but you must do your own thinking and you must write up and submit your own solutions.</li><li>There are limits to collaboration:  Wide distribution of a solution will tempt too many students to do no thinking of their own.  Hence, although you may discuss anything about the project with other students in the class, you are not permitted to widely share your answers.  In addition:<ul><li>Use of “homework services” such as chegg.com and coursehero.com is not permitted.</li><li>Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, etc. is not permitted.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Bonus marks</strong></p><ul><li><u>In-person students</u> who faithfully attend the in-person lectures can get bonus marks.  I will occasionally distribute slips to each person present in the lecture room.  Correctly answer a simple question on the slip, and put the slip in the box at the front of the room.  Each signed, correctly answered, and submitted slip is worth 0.5%.  Slips will not be accepted after the end of the lecture in which they were handed out.</li><li><u>Online students</u> can also get bonus marks.  Most of the 36 lecture videos explain how a random subset of viewers can get a 0.5% bonus mark.  Correctly answer a simple question by the stated deadline, and you get the bonus.</li><li><u>Mixed learning modes</u>:  Students who switch between in-person and online learning may collect a mixture of in-person and online bonus marks.  Switching (depending on the timing if the switches) may result in a different number of opportunities to get bonus marks.</li><li><u>Maximum bonus</u>:  In all cases, the maximum overall bonus per student is 3%.</li></ul><p> </p>

Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
