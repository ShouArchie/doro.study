<p>This course will offer an introduction to the principles and practices of fabrication of integrated circuits and evolving nanoelectronic technology. Major emphasis will be on unit processes of silicon technology along with advanced topics in the fabrication and non-ideal characteristics of the pn-junction, metal-semiconductor contacts, MOS capacitor, and MOSFET will be covered. The effect of microfabrication processes on device performance will be presented and characterization techniques to identify the origins controlling the device operation. </p>

<p><i><u>Format for Project Paper</u></i></p><p>Select a particular processing technology to review and write a paper based on the following elements: </p><ul><li>INTRODUCTION: An introduction to the general field related to its history, advantages, disadvantages, materials/device/technology options, and current state of the art.</li><li>Past Challenges and issues in development: An overview of the technological advances that were required to achieve the state of the art. If applicable, include fundamental phenomena, theoretical background, underlying mechanisms, current understanding, and major areas of focus. </li><li>CURRENT CHALLENGES: An overview on current issues/limitations, its root causes, and potential solutions.</li><li>RECENT ADVANCES: A highlight of recent developments in the field related to the topic and the current state-of-the-art results. Provide analysis of the state-of-the-art advances and its impact on the future direction of the technology.</li><li>Conclusions: Summarize the relevant information and analysis of the project topic. </li></ul><p><i><u>Written Report</u></i></p><p>A written report presenting the main findings of the literature search on the topic is due by 4:30 PM on Wednesday, March 31, 2024. Email an electronic PDF copy (.pdf) to the instructor.</p><p>• The report should include: (i) title page, (ii) abstract, (iii) main body, and (iv) references sections. </p><p>• The “abstract” should be no longer than 100 words and should concisely capture the main points of the report. </p><p>• The “main body” should typically be 7-10 double-spaced pages (excluding any figures and/or tables), Times New Roman font size 12, and includes sections using the same titles/subtitles as outlined above in the Format section.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as written analysis of technical and engineering topics. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
