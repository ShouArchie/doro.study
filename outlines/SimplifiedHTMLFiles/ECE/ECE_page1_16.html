<p>The design and engineering of computing chips is an exciting, and valuable skill that spans multiple engineering disciplines including software engineering, parallel programming, verification and reasoning, compilation techniques, down to physical/analog/electrical effects. This course will help open the door to careers in the richly-rewarding chip design industry in a variety of roles such as RTL developers, verification engineers, system-level developers, and future leaders and managers. With the impending demise of Moore's Law, now more than ever, careful bottom-up rethinking of the hardware stacks are necessary. Many chip startups today are developing new hardware for machine learning/AI, database acceleration, virtualized network functions, and other domains. The next decade or so will see exciting opportunities for overhauling our silicon infrastructure. ECE327 will be vital to navigate these exciting times.</p><h2>🗝 Enrollment</h2><p><strong>Prerequisite(s):</strong> (ECE 222 or MTE 241); (ECE 224 or MTE 325); (ECE 124 or MTE 262 or SE 141); Level at least 3A Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering or Mechatronics Engineering or Software Engineering or Computer Science/Digital Hdw Op</p><h2>📓 Objectives</h2><ol><li>The design of hardware components requires reasoning about a unique form of parallelism and concurrency. We must think about and understand concurrent operations at a cycle-by-cycle level of abstraction. Hardware description languages such as Verilog provide a programming environment that makes it possible to express this form of parallelism. We will understand the fundamental building blocks of the programming languages necessary to describe hardware.</li><li>There are commonly used paradigms, and design patterns that we must known when organizing the RTL code. Most digital designs must describe interaction protocols with the outside world, manage state, and capture datapath operation behavior of the digital design. We will learn how to break down a complex design into these components, and learn how to reason about correctness, and understand their translation to hardware primitives. We will use tools such as AMD/Xilinx Xsim (verification) along with AMD/Xilinx Vivado (synthesis).</li><li>It is important to analyze the design for goodness metrics such as resource usage, performance, and power consumption. Most digital design are constrained to fit specific cost targets, and the analysis tools help guide the design process with appropriate feedback. We will learn how to interpret the results of the FPGA CAD tools and incorporate that feedback to redesign our RTL. These compilation iterations are fundamental to digital design and a good designer knows how to direct the tools, rewrite Verilog code, and generate the desired hardware.</li><li>A class project will be used to tie together all the key design lessons we learn in this course. The project will be broken down into a series of labs; each lab is a phase/milestones over the course of the term to guide student progress. We will be developing a large-language model (LLM) solution involving a matrix multiplier as part of the project.</li></ol><p> </p>

<h2>🖥️ Labs</h2><p>There are five labs in this course that incrementally build towards a coherent complete hardware design. Labs will be held in-class on Tuesdays across two E7 rooms and attendance with the TA-run labs would be beneficial to help your complete the labs.</p><ul><li>All labs are <strong>individual</strong> assignments.</li><li>The labs introduce you to the Verilog programming language, AMD/Xilinx XSim simulation tool, and the AMD/Xilinx Vivado implementation tool.</li><li>The labs incrementally reuse previous lab content to assemble a complete design.</li><li>FPGA board deployment will be done as part of some of the labs, and you will get a chance to rectify errors should this fail. You must do this work in the physical lab.</li><li>University-mandated accommodations will be provided in the form of 2-day extensions to lab deadlines.</li><li>Labs are due at 11:59pm the day of the deadline.</li><li>Each lab has a 50% code review component that is assessed based on an oral interview to ensure students actually understand the content and are not just copying someone else's code.</li><li>Each lab has a graded mini-quiz or an oral (worth ~25% of the lab grade) to be determined at the discretion of the instructor. If you fail to be present for the oral/in-class mini-quiz you will get a zero on that component. You can take the optional final if you want to restore this grade. Remember, the final exam covers the entire course!</li><li>If you fail to turn in a lab by the 2-day extension deadline, the lab will not be regraded.</li><li>Labs will not be regraded if you forgot to commit your file, dog ate you ssh key, or other excuses.</li></ul><p>The lab topics are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Lab1</strong> LLM building blocks 1 (multiply-accumulate, accumulate, accumulate squares, max), Simulation — 5% of final grade</li><li><strong>Lab2</strong> LLM building blocks 2 (exp, div, gelu), Simulation + Implementation — 10% of final grade</li><li><strong>Lab3</strong> LLM building blocks 3 (systolic array mm, address generators) , Design + Simulation + Implementation + FPGA Deployment — 15% of final grade</li><li><strong>Lab4</strong> LLM building blocks 4 (softmax, single attention head), Design + Simulation + Implementation — 10% of final grade</li><li><strong>Lab5</strong> LLM design integration (layer norm, mm+layernorm, mm+gelu, ibert), Design + Simulation + Implementation + FPGA Board + Optimizations — 10% of the final grade</li></ul><h2>📝 Quizzes</h2><ul><li>There will be four quizzes in this course. Quizzes will be held in-class during the scheduled lab sessions on Tuesdays.</li><li>Quiz questions will involve problem-solving rather than rote memorization.</li><li>You will be asked to solve a combination of short and long problems based on material covered in class upto that point. There will be a greater emphasis on recently covered content for each quiz. Tutorial problems will be good indications of what may appear on the quiz.</li><li>University-mandated accommodations will be provided as a "makeup assignment" for a single missed quiz with valid justification of medical condition or extenuating circumstances -- this assignment will be a special "final exam" covering all course content irrespective of which quiz you missed. If you miss more than one quiz you <i>may</i> have to take an incomplete on the course. Precise determination will be done on a case-by-case basis.</li><li>Quiz question regrade requests expire 7 days (at the stroke of the midnight hour) after the quiz grades are released.</li></ul><p>The quiz topics are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Quiz1</strong> "The Gom Jabbar", Dune  — Simulation, Synthesis — 12.5% of final grade</li><li><strong>Quiz2</strong> "The Test of the Ring-Bearer", Lord of the Rings —  FSMs, Pipelining, Retiming — 12.5% of final grade</li><li><strong>Quiz3</strong> "The Kobayashi Maru", Starfleet Academy Training Exercise —  Scheduling, Memories — 12.5% of final grade</li><li><strong>Quiz4</strong> "Ender Wiggin's Final Test", Ender's Game — Dataflow, Timing, Power — 12.5% of final grade</li></ul><h2>Deadlines (Winter 2025)</h2><p>- We do not provide an option for deferred quizzes or lab mini-quiz/oral. <br/>- For any missed graded item, we offer the option of taking a final if you miss it for a legitimate reason as per university guidelines.</p><p>Jan 16,lab1 due<br/>Jan 28,quiz1</p><p>Feb 6,lab2 due<br/>Feb 11,quiz2<br/><br/>Mar 13,lab3 due<br/>Mar 11,quiz3</p><p>Mar 27,lab4 due</p><p>Apr 25,lab 5 due (TA support ends on April 4th)<br/>Apr 1,quiz4</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h2>🚨 Fair Contingencies for Emergency Remote Teaching</h2><p>To provide contingency for unforeseen circumstances, the instructor reserves the right to modify course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines with due notice to students. In the event of further challenges, the instructor will work with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty.</p><h2>🧐 Academic Integrity for Individual Assessments.</h2><p>Plagiarism in ECE327 will likely manifest in the form of copying RTL code, scripts, bitstreams as-is or recast with minor modifications. Neither of these are permitted. We expect students to enforce an honor system. Please familiarize yourself with the discussion of plagiarism in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a>.</p><p>To formalize this clearly, here is what we will be doing. We will run MOSS plagiarism detection scripts for labs.</p><ol><li>First offense will get you a zero on the lab grade.</li><li>Second offense will result in a note to go higher up the chain of command.</li><li>You will be provided with a chance to dispute the MOSS score. However, the filters are fairly robust.</li></ol><p>We have a MOSS configuration to check code plagiarism and we take this seriously. So, do not copy!</p><h2>🏳 Compassionate Consideration.</h2><p>If you are facing challenges that are affecting more than one course, please contact your Associate Chair or Director of your program. They will review your case and coordinate a reasonable and fair plan in consultation with appropriate others (for example: Instructors, Department Undergraduate Studies Committee, Chair, AccessAbility Services, Engineering Counselling services, Registrar's Office). We will consider 2-day extension to lab deadlines. No quiz extensions will be provided and missed quiz will mean the need to attend a special final.</p><h2>🩺 <strong>Wellness Support and Contact Information.</strong></h2><p>We all need a support system. We encourage you to seek out mental health supports when they are needed. Please reach out to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Campus Wellness and Counselling Services</a>. We understand that these circumstances can be troubling, and you may need to speak with someone for emotional support. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/services/good2talk">Good2Talk</a> is a post-secondary student helpline based in Ontario, Canada that is available to all students including outside Ontario. <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/uw-mates">MATES</a> is a one-to-one student peer support program offered by the Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association in consultation with Campus Wellness. MATES provides support to students who are hoping to build social skills, or are experiencing personal or academic concerns or low-level mental health and wellness difficulties.</p>
