The design will be conducted by a team of two students (typically)**. The instructor may provide some ideas for students to choose from. Students however are encouraged to come up with their own ideas of the device they wish to design. In all cases students must seek the TA’s approval of their idea to make sure it is suitable and has not been taken by other students (first come first serve basis), and must confirm their final design idea with the TA by Friday, Mar 14, 2025. The design will be presented in a 8-13 page write-up (as a pdf file) to be submitted by uploading to the designated Dropbox on Learn by Friday, April 4, 2025.</p><p><i><u>Design Elements:</u></i></p><p>Your design will involve selecting:</p><p>a. the general device structure including the different components (e.g. the layers to be included in the device that you deem necessary for the proper functioning of the device and their sequence, outlining the role(s) of each layer and/or component)</p><p>b. the specific material for each layer of the device including the substrate, electrodes, semiconductor layers, etc.</p><p>c. the thicknesses of each layer</p><p>d. any other elements that you consider to be important for making your device satisfy the desired requirements</p><p> </p><p>In making the above design choices for the various layers of the devices, the fundamental material properties that are relevant for the function of the specific layer or layers should be considered. The following are examples of some of the fundamental properties that should be considered in making choices about the material, layer sequence and layer thickness selection:</p><p>i. the mobility of holes and/or electrons in the material (for all layers with a charge transporting role)</p><p>ii. the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the material (for achieving the desired charge transfer across inter-layer interfaces)</p><p>iii. the bandgap of the material (for layers with light emission or absorption functionalities)</p><p>iv. the quantum yield and exciton relaxation efficiency of the material (for layers with light emission functionalities)</p><p>v. the optical density of the material (for layers with light absorption functionalities)</p><p>vi. the exciton diffusion length (for layers where the diffusion of excitons can play an important role on its functionality)</p><p>vii. etc.</p><p> </p><p><i><u>The Write-up:</u></i></p><p>The design will be presented in a 8-13 page (single-spaced) write-up, to be submitted by uploading it to the designated Dropbox folder on Learn. Turnitin® software will be used in assessing the originality of the writing. The write-up should include the following info in separate sections using the subtitles provided in italics and numbered with the same numbers 1-7):</p><p>1. Executive Summary (0.5-1 page) : This section will consist of two paragraphs. The first paragraph will outline the main objectives of the design and the set of performance and/or fabrication requirements that the device needs to satisfy. This paragraph will serve as a “problem definition”. The second paragraph will briefly summarize your design and its various aspects, including a description of the general device structure (see bullet a above) and the specific materials used in it (see bullet b above). This second paragraph will serve to articulate your proposed solution to the problem outlined in the first paragraph,</p><p>2. General Device Structure (2-3 pages): This section will provide a detailed description of the structure (bullet a above) of your device and its operation mechanism. Include 1 or 2 schematic diagrams (showing device structure cross sectional views and/or energy band diagrams as appropriate).</p><p>3. Choice of Materials (3-5 pages): This section will provide an account of the material(s) proposed for each layer of the device proposed in the previous section. Give a brief justification/explanation for your choice of each material based on the relevant properties (bullets i-viii above) of each material, backing your claims with references from scientific papers. For each organic or organometallic semiconductor material selected in your design, i) show the molecular structure in a schematic diagram that also includes the full chemical name of the material plus any acronyms used for this material in your document, and ii) a brief explanation of how the molecular structure enables or supports the properties you desire from this material (this info can be found in research or review papers; make sure to cite all papers properly!).</p><p>4. Layers Thicknesses (1-2 pages): This section will provide an explanation for the thickness ranges proposed for each layer of your device. In general, layers of semiconductor materials should be as thin as possible (to minimize ohmic losses across layers as well as material utilization and cost since these materials can be expensive) but thick enough to ensure the layers</p><p>are continuous and pinhole free, and more importantly, to meet certain design requirements (such as achieving sufficient light absorption, limiting (or promoting) exciton diffusion effects, counter-balancing differences between electron and hole mobilities in order to achieve more balanced conduction, etc. as may be relevant).</p><p>5. Other Design Considerations (1-2 pages): This section will provide an account of any other considerations or choices you made in your design that you felt were relevant.</p><p>6. Conclusion (0.5-1 page): In this section provide a conclusive summary of your design (which can be similar to the second paragraph of the Executive Summary)</p><p>7. Learning Reflection (0.5-1 page). In this section each team member will outline at least 3 aspects (new knowledge, perspectives, ideas, etc.) that conducting this design assignment has helped them learn or expand their knowledge in. These aspects will be outlined in bullet format and each student (i.e. team member) will put their initials next to their own bullets.</p><p>** Note: Students who choose to work individually on the assignment or cannot find a partner will receive 2 extra points to their assignment mark as a bonus. The final mark of the assignment, including any bonus points, will not exceed 20.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>ECE634 LITERATURE REVIEW:</strong></p><p>1) Each student will conduct an in-depth, individually conducted review of at least 3 scientific papers on one topic relevant to organic electronics. The students will give an oral presentation and write a written critique on the papers</p><p>2) The topic and papers are to be selected by the student, but must be approved by the course instructor. The final choice of topic and papers must be confirmed to the instructor by email and approved by the instructor by the end of week 8 of the term (i.e. March 7, 2025).</p><p>3) In general, in order to be acceptable, each selected paper must meet the following conditions:</p><p>a. Must be a peer-reviewed research article on a topic in the field of organic electronic materials and devices</p><p>b. Must be published within the last 7 years in an ISI-indexed journal with an impact factor &gt;5.0</p><p>c. Must have received &gt;10 citations (papers published in the last two years are exempted from this requirement)</p><p>d. Must be at least 5 journal pages long (excluding references)</p><p>4) PDF copies of the confirmed papers (i.e. after they have already been approved by the instructor earlier) should be emailed to the instructor <strong>no later than the end of week 8 of the term</strong>. The following file name format must be used for the PDFs: <strong>YourLastName_FirstAuthorLastName_YearPublished.pdf</strong></p><p>5) Marking Scheme:</p><p>a. Oral Presentation: 14% of total course grade</p><p>b. Participation in the Q&amp;A sessions of the other ECE634 students presentations: 2% of total course grade</p><p>c. Written Critique: 9% of total course grade</p><p> </p><p><u>6) Oral Presentation:</u></p><p>a. The presentation will typically be 25-30 minutes long including time for Q&amp;A. <strong>The presentations will be scheduled (tentatively) for weeks 11 &amp; 12 of the term.</strong> The presentations are normally scheduled during regular class hours, however, depending on the number of students taking the course (and hence the number of presentations), they may have to be scheduled outside of regular class hours. The exact dates and times (as well as presentation length) will depend on the final number of students enrolled in the course and therefore will be confirmed later by Week 7 of the term.</p><p>b. A copy of presentation slides should be uploaded to the designated Dropbox on Learn by 8:00 am on the day of your presentation. The following file name format must be used for your slides file:</p><p>YourLastName.pdf. The slides will be uploaded on LEARN and made available to all students in the class.</p><p>c. In general, your review, and hence your presentation, should include the following elements:</p><p>i. Background: This part should give some introduction to the general topic that the selected papers represent. This part can be for all papers combined, or divided to serve as a separate background for each paper, as may be appropriate</p><p>ii. Results &amp; Discussion: A brief outline of the important results or findings in each paper</p><p>iii. Conclusions: A summary of the main conclusions of each paper</p><p>d. Marking: The following general and approximate marking scheme will be used:</p><p>Background (3/14); Results &amp; Discussion (4/14); Summary of Conclusions (1/14); General Presentation (2/14); Answers to questions (4/14).</p><p>Note: The variety in the nature of the different topics may require customizing the marking scheme to make it more relevant to the individual topics. Therefore, the actual marking scheme may differ from this one.</p><p> </p><p><u>7) Written Critique:</u></p><p>a. The critique will be 3 single-spaced pages max (+ a title page, that shows your name, the main topic covered by the papers, and the full bibliographic information of the papers) written in font size 12, and will include two parts; 1) a ~¼ - ½ page overview for each paper, each in a separate section, that summarizes the main findings and conclusions of the paper, and 2) a personal critique section that presents your own views of the strengths and/or weaknesses of the papers, with appropriate justifications, and areas where results or conclusions of the papers may agree or disagree with each other.</p><p>b. The critique is due by <strong>Friday, April 4th, 2025.</strong> The document should be submitted by uploading it to the designated Dropbox folder on Learn. Turnitin® software will be used in assessing the originality of the writing.</p><p>c. Marking: The following general and approximate marking scheme will be used: Part 1 (4.5/9); Part 2 (4.5/9) Note: The variety in the nature of the different topics may require customizing the marking scheme to make it more relevant to the individual topics. Therefore, the actual marking scheme may differ from this one.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
