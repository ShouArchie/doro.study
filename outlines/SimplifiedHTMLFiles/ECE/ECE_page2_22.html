<h3>Labs</h3><p>Labs may be completed in small groups, as specified below.  Deliverables may include code, technical reports, and live demonstrations.  Code and reports will be submitted electronically using a LEARN drop box.  For live demos, if applicable, the teaching team may pose technical questions to any group member during assessment.  All group members must be familiar with the details of the solution.  The teaching team may reorganize groups, as needed, for academic purposes.</p><p>Late lab submissions will be penalized 1% per hour (or fraction thereof).  For example, a lab that is late by 5 minutes will be penalized 1%, and a lab that is late by 28 hours will be penalized 28%.  The instructor reserves the right to extend deadlines and reduce lateness penalties at his discretion.  Academic regulations prohibit deadline extensions beyond the last day of classes.</p><h3>Exams</h3><p>The final exam will be closed book, with no aids allowed.</p><p>To be considered for any accommodation in the event of a missed exam, the student is required to complete a Verification of Illness Form (VIF). The VIF should be submitted within five business days of the missed exam, except in cases of prolonged self-isolation or incapacitation. The instructor will determine accommodations based on existing university and department-level policies and guidelines. In situations where such policies and guidelines are not specific or leave room for interpretation, the instructor will exercise his own discretion and consider the degree of incapacitation as well as the method by which incapacitation was assessed (e.g., self-assessment vs. professional medical examination).  A make-up final exam, if offered by the instructor, may be scheduled in a future academic term.</p><h3>Grading and Regrading</h3><p>All coursework items will be graded on the basis of completeness, correctness, and clarity.  Members of the teaching team may also evaluate students' proficiency in the use of software in connection with labs.  Homework problem sets will not be graded but are important for success on the final exam.</p><p>Where appropriate, students are expected to test their own solutions to problems using appropriate input data.  If a student's solution differs substantially from the solution recognized by the teaching team, the student may be asked to provide sample inputs and outputs to evaluate the correctness of their solution.</p><p>Students who feel that they have been graded unfairly may request that a coursework item be re-graded, in which case the entire item (e.g., lab, project, or exam) will be re-graded.  As a result, the grade may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged.  The teaching team may refuse to re-grade coursework if there is evidence that the solution was modified or otherwise tampered with after submission.</p><h3>Collaboration</h3><p>Although aspects of the course may involve collaborative work, each student is responsible for learning all the material covered in lectures, labs, and homework problem sets.  Exams may cover both theory and practice, including your ability to read and write SQL code.</p><p>Labs may be completed in small groups (1, 2, or 3 students per group). Members of the teaching team may assign or rearrange such groups for academic reasons, and may even request that certain students work alone.  Students are encouraged to seek help from the teaching team for lab work.  Copying code or documentation from other lab groups (including from past offerings of ECE356, ECE456, or ECE656) is forbidden, and constitutes an academic offence under Policy 71.  Students are free to use any code samples included with course materials (e.g., course textbook, lectures notes, or lab manual), or provided in materials referenced by course materials (e.g., MySQL Reference Manual). Any code copied from existing sources, whether in binary or source form, must be acknowledged clearly (i.e., say what was copied and from where) in the deliverables.</p>
</div>
<a></a>
<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (e.g., Turnitin and Moss) will be used to screen labs and projects in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in coursework deliverables is properly documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided on request about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin, Moss, and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
