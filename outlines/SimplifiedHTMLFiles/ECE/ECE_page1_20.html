<p><strong>About Prof. Zarnett</strong></p><p>I graduated from the Computer Engineering program at Waterloo (under a previous curriculum), and have since earned my Master's Degree (also at Waterloo) and my P.Eng. license. For the last 11+ years I have also been teaching here at UW and the other courses I have taught and worked on include ECE 150, ECE 155, ECE 252, ECE 254, ECE 290, ECE 356, SE 350, MTE 241, and ECE 459. All software and also the law and ethics course one time -- let's discuss contract law if you're up for it?. The fastest way to reach me about course material is a Piazza post, or e-mail for other things, because I tend to respond to these things much faster but also because other people probably have the same question.<br/><br/><strong>About Dr. Ma, Lab Instructor</strong><br/>Started at UWaterloo January 2022<br/>8 years industry engineering experience in display &amp; imaging<br/>BASc &amp; MSc from UWaterloo, PhD from McGill University<br/>Research specialization brain-machine interfacing<br/>Hobbies include photography and pyrography<br/><br/><strong>Teaching Assistants</strong></p><p>Ahmed Elbaroudy - ammaelba@uwaterloo.ca<br/>Neeraj Nagar - nnagar@uwaterloo.ca</p>

<p>The course notes should be pretty much everything you need for this course. They are primarily based on the below-named  books; each of them has a different take on things and they all have their strengths and weaknesses. I read them so you don’t have to! They are neither required nor recommended, but I'll list them here in case you truly wish to look at them.<br/><br/>• Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin, and Greg Gagne.

<p>A grade of INC (Incomplete) is to be assigned if you do not make a reasonable attempt all lab projects. If the lab projects are not completed within 4 months of the end of the course to the satisfaction of the course instructor, the INC (Incomplete) grade will be converted to FTC (Failure to Complete). If the lab projects are completed successfully within the required timeframe, the overall grade will be calculated using the rules for lates ubmission.</p><p>The University rules say if you don’t show up for the final exam, without an acceptable reason, your grade in the class will be DNW - Did Not Write. This is very undesirable.</p>
</div>
<a></a>
<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Lateness: The lab project manual contains the policies related to lab submission lateness; please see the lab manual for details. The administration section of the manual shall be treated as though it is a part of the course syllabus. <br/><br/>Collaboration and Group Work: It is expected you will collaborate with your lab partners on the labs. Your lab submissions are joint efforts and the work you submit is that of your lab group. Note, however, that grades are still individual and if one group member is not contributing to the lab work at all, that student may receive a zero in the lab. Please bring this situation to the attention of the course staff as soon as possible so that can be resolved quickly.<br/><br/>You may discuss ideas, design alternatives, and help others debug small fragments of code for assignments and labs. However, each group must submit their own, independently-developed code for each lab. Similarly, each person must submit their own, independently-developed code for each assignment.<br/><br/>I suggest you avoid looking at other people’s code entirely, but if you do, then you should not be doing that anywhere you might be writing your own code. The temptation to write your code just like what you see is simply too high.<br/><br/>Groups are not permitted to share lab code electronically or in written form, unless such sharing has been clearly documented and acknowledged in the receiving work. An acknowledged fragment will not be considered while grading the lab, but will not result in disciplinary penalties.<br/>Acknowledgements must include the name(s) of the providing group and the date of the collaboration.<br/><br/>Individuals are not permitted to share assignment code electronically or in written form, unless such sharing has been clearly documented and acknowledged in the receiving work. An acknowledged fragment will not be considered while grading the assignment, but will not result in disciplinary penalties. Acknowledgements must include the name of the providing individual and the date of the collaboration. Plagiarism. Plagiarism is not permitted, and this applies to source code also. The course staff will be checking for it through a variety of different methods. Any cases of plagiarism I detect will be reported, according to university policy.<br/><br/>Your code will be checked for plagiarism using MOSS (Measure Of Software Similarity). You may request to opt out of the automatic screening by sending a formal written letter to your instructor explaining why; a meeting will then follow to discuss the subject with the instructor. In the (hopefully unlikely) event of any student(s) discovered in an incident of academic dishonesty, I will report this to the Associate Dean of Undergraduate studies. Should the Associate Dean conclude that plagiarism or another academic integrity violation has occurred, the punishment applied will be as the Associate Dean directs. Most likely, every student involved will receive a grade of 0 (zero) for the corresponding evaluation item, and<br/>additionally will receive a deduction of 5 (five) marks from the final grade of the course as a standard penalty. However, penalties may be more severe for repeat offenders (see below for information on Academic Integrity). In cases where the incident consists of submitting common work (such as lab projects which are done with your partner), every student involved will be subject to the above penalty — no student will be allowed to “take full responsibility”, regardless of who copied and who is the genuine author of the work submitted; and regardless of the actions by the students involved or related events that led to the incident.<br/><br/>All of the above applies to multiple instances — a student caught in several incidents of academic dishonesty will be subject to the above penalties for each of the incidents.<br/><br/>I want to emphasize that I take the issue of plagiarism very seriously, and so does the University of Waterloo. If you are uncertain about this subject, please seek some guidance. There are many resources available to you. You can check the university policies, talk to the course instructor or lab instructor, visit the ECE Undergrad Office, et cetera.<br/><br/>Or, let’s sum this up: (1) Acknowledge the work of others and (2) if you are uncertain, ask!

  Administrative Policy

<p><strong>Generative AI.</strong></p><p>The teaching team is keenly aware of the existence of generative AI (e.g., Github Copilot, ChatGPT) and how such tools can be used to write and test code. This is not a bad thing; IDEs, autocomplete, compilers, libraries, and tools like linters or Valgrind have existed for a long time and can all help you to write your code in an eﬃcient way by doing things for you that at one time you had to do manually. We know that banning them does not work (how could we check that, even?) and in reality (co‐op or full time employment), you’ll not only use these things, but might be less productive than your colleagues if you do not (but it depends on the tool!). So – we trust you to use these things responsibly. What does using generative AI responsibly mean?</p><p>Our asks on this are two simple things. The ﬁrst is that you should acknowledge if you used code given to you by an AI tool, just as you would if you found something on a website somewhere. The second thing is that you should use the tool(s) to help you, not do it all for you. This means you should understand the output it gives you and can verify that it is correct (remember that this is your professional responsibility under the law). Keep in mind that AI models are subject to “hallucinations” (making things up that aren’t true or aren’t real) and errors (bugs, vulnerabilities).</p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><p><strong>Piazza.</strong></p><p>Piazza is a great tool for collaboration and it allows rapid but asynchronous exchange of information. It almost goes without saying, but we ask you to be respectful and polite when communicating via this medium and to assume the best about others, as tone can be diﬃcult to interpret on a discussion forum.</p><p>Before posting your question, please consider whether this question can be answered by looking at either the course notes, lab manual, or documentation available on the internet (e.g., man pages). To help others ﬁnd answers later, (1) we discourage screenshot‐only posts (since the content does not show up in search results) and (2) we encourage you to please restrict a single thread to one question (or a closely‐related set of questions).</p><p>For the most part, we encourage (but do not require) you to make your question(s) public so that other students may beneﬁt from the answer. If something was non‐obvious or unclear to you, it was likely to others as well. If your question includes detailed design information or code excerpts related to a deliverable (e.g., an assignment), then please do make it a private question.</p><p>Please also keep in mind that course staﬀ may not be able to answer your question immediately as they have many other responsibilities throughout the term (and the frequency of questions tends to spike before due dates or exams). We encourage you to think through the problem before posting, but acknowledge that just like “rubber duck debugging” sometimes the act of writing down the nature of the problem provides insight into solving it.</p><p><strong>Re‐marking. </strong>If you believe that your grade on an assignment is incorrect, you may ask that it be re‐marked. To request that a question be re‐marked, you will need to submit your request in writing via e‐mail to the instructor.</p><p>When you submit your request, it should include the following: (1) your name and student ID number; (2) a clear indication of which question or part of the deliverable is to be re‐marked; and (3) an explanation of why you believe the grade assigned was incorrect.</p><p>Requests for re‐marking may be submitted any time before the ﬁnal exam. Be forewarned: when a deliverable is being re‐marked, your grade could go up, it could stay the same, or it could go down. You will be notiﬁed of the outcome.</p><p><strong>Extra Credit. </strong>In this class, there will be no opportunities to earn extra credit. Make‐up assignments or examinations will not be oﬀered under any circumstances.</p><p><strong>Attendance &amp; Illness. </strong>There are video lectures, but we can’t make you watch them. In fact, I [PL] don’t know whether I would actually watch all the hours of lectures if I was taking the class (I hate video). The lecture notes are the source material for the video lectures and also contain much of the information that we say. Thus, you have some options to choose the materials that work best for you. As you’ve surely noticed by now, at university, there is a lot that you have to learn on your own by doing assignments.</p><p>We do hope, though, that you stay on top of the material throughout the term and don’t try to cram it all before the ﬁnal exam/assignments. That’s why the assignment deadlines are spread throughout the term. </p><p>If you feel ill, you should seek appropriate medical attention. If you are feeling unwell during the exam, you should complete the self‐declaration of illness form or get a declaration of illness form signed. If you anticipate missing a deliverable deadline or an examination for a non‐medical reason, you should contact your instructor as soon as you are aware of the problem. Given suﬃcient notice, alternate arrangements may be possible. Alternate arrangements are rare and at instructor discretion. Still, we understand that emergencies happen, and pledge to be understanding.</p><p>If one of the instructors should be ill, we’ll either revert that section to online lectures only during the aﬀected period, or have the other instructor cover the lectures. We are certainly not going to show up while ill, and you should not either.</p><p><strong>Laptop and Device Policy. </strong>The human visual system has evolved to perceive saber‐toothed tigers in the savannah. Fortunately, tigers are rare in Waterloo, Ontario (Geese, on the other hand...). Unfortunately, your classmates are still human and hence their attention will be drawn to ﬂashing lights (or Tiktok, or movies, or video games) in their peripheral vision. We encourage everyone to be respectful of their classmates and to not distract them.</p><p>Wise use of computers and the Internet can be helpful for fully engaging in class. You might want to try out some syntax, or you might want to look up constructors, or you might want to verify your instructor’s somewhat outrageous‐sounding claim.</p><p>To support the beneﬁts of the Internet while reducing distractions, we will adopt the following policy for in‐person lectures in this class. We are asking that the ﬁrst 2 rows of class be text‐oriented: if using a device, use a command prompt or text editor, maximized to the whole screen. Paper is always good, of course. Mac OS X and UNIX command prompts are probably your best bet; for those of you on Windows, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux. From the command prompt, you can use compilers and text‐mode web browsers (w3m, lynx, links/elinks, etc....) tmux may also be helpful in managing multiple terminal sessions. Being proﬁcient with the terminal is a highly‐useful skill for a Software Engineer.</p><p>We acknowledge that lectures are not always engaging. Instead of distracting screen content, we recommend non‐distracting ways of tuning out, like doodling on paper (while taking notes), or doing homework. (we also recommend passing notes to each other instead of talking).</p><p>If you need to sit towards the front of the class and use a GUI program, then please discuss with your instructor to register yourself as an exception. If you sign up for the exception list, we’ll ask to you agree to not display games, videos, or social media on your screen (unless it is part of the class).</p><p>Enforcement is a sensitive issue, especially given the existence of exceptions. We are primarily asking each of you to respect the policy on your own. But, if you see someone with games, videos, or social media in the terminal zone, you can politely bring it up with them.</p><p>tl;dr: paper or text‐oriented programs in ﬁrst 2 rows of class during regular lectures (not in‐class exercises).</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
