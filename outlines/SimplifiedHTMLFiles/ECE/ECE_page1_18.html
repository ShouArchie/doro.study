<p><i>Instructor's Description:</i></p><p>ECE 340 is the third core course in a three-course sequence (after ECE 140 and ECE 240) on electronic circuits. ECE 340 focusses on the analysis and design of transistor amplifiers using integrated circuit (IC) technology, where transistors and other electronic components are built together on a semiconductor chip. We study amplifiers, and their supporting circuits, because these are essential building blocks for many analog application-specific ICs (ASICs), including sensor interfaces, baseband-communication systems, power-delivery circuits, and data converters. We will study transistor amplifiers built using metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and bipolar junction transistors (BJTs).</p>
