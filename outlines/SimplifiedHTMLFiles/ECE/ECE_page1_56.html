However, some students may prefer to read text explaining these concepts.</p><p>A recent book discusses the major functions of autonomous vehicles, touching on many of the topics covered in the course and beyond</p><p>S. Liu, L. Li, J. Tang, S. Wu, J.-L. Gaudiot. Creating Autonomous Vehicle Systems, Second Edition, Morgan and Claypool Publishers, 2020</p><p>Sadly, the editing is substandard and scholarly attention to detail is lacking; however, the text is reasonably easy to follow and gives a good introduction to many topics covered in the course, especially planning. The PDF of the book is available from UW library.</p><p>The following selection of book chapters (including from the book by Liu et al.) and papers cover the topics presented in class. The advanced materials section includes two papers that cover the motion planning approach covered in the class; however, keep in mind that there is a vast variety of methods for planning, some of which are discussed in the book by Liu et al.  </p><p> </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Topics</strong></td><td><strong>Recommended Reading</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Computer Vision Fundamentals</td><td><p>E.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Course Policies</h4><p><strong>Collaboration &amp; Plagiarism</strong>:<i> </i>Plagiarism, taking credit for work that others did, is not permitted, and this applies to source code as well as exams. The course staff will be checking for it through a variety of different methods. Any cases of plagiarism I detect will be reported, according to university policy (see the University Policy section below).</p><p>For the assignments, you may discuss ideas and design alternatives; however, each student must submit their own, independently developed reports and code. You also need to properly cite any external sources you use in preparing your deliverables. Copying solutions developed by others is unacceptable under any circumstances. You are expected to develop solutions on your own.</p><p>No collaboration of any kind is permitted during exams.</p><p>I want to emphasize that I take the issue of plagiarism very seriously, and so does the University of Waterloo. If you are uncertain about this subject, please seek some guidance. There are many resources available to you. You can check the university policies, talk to the course instructor or teaching assistant, et cetera.</p><p><strong>Use of generative AI</strong>: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) using large language models (LLM) or other methods trained to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. However, you are recommended to work through the assignment problems yourself first before eliciting help from GenAI and to ensure you understand and critically analyze the suggestions produced by GenAI.</p><p>Recommendations for how to cite GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library:</p><p> <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai">https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</a>.</p><p>Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
