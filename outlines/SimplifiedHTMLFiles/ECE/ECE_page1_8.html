<p>As an overview, this course will introduce the application of computational methods for modeling and simulating real-world physical systems. The employment of fixed-precision arithmetic in computers introduces errors that, when unaddressed, can undermine the validity of any approximations or simulations. By comprehending the limitations of such arithmetic, we can develop computational methods that enable us to mitigate these effects allowing us to, in turn, to attain sufficiently accurate approximations or simulations within a practical timeframe.</p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>Each full course at the University of Waterloo consists of 36 lectures spread over nominally twelve weeks of classes. These twelve weeks do not include the autumnal and winter reading weeks. If there are holidays throughout the term, there will be make-up lectures at the end of the term. Also, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering cancels classes during mid-term week and, instead, offers make-up lectures. Thus, the make-up lectures before the mid-term week will speed the progression through the course material, and after mid-term week, we will be initially a lecture or two behind, but then as subsequent make-up lectures occur, we will catch up once again with the schedule below. The schedule below is "tentative" and not intended to reflect exactly what topics are covered in which week of the course.</p><p><strong>Week 1</strong><br/>1 Course introduction<br/>2 Representation of real numbers</p><p><strong>Week 2</strong><br/>3 Tools for finding numerical algorithms<br/>3.1 Weighted averages<br/>3.2 Iteration and fixed-point iteration<br/>3.3 Linear algebra</p><p><strong>Week 3</strong><br/>3.4 Interpolation<br/>3.5 Taylor series<br/>3.6 Bracketing<br/>3.7 Intermediate-value theorem<br/>3.8 Summary of tools and looking ahead<br/>4 Types and sources of error</p><p><strong>Week 4</strong><br/>5 Introduction to approximating the value of expressions<br/>5.1 Evaluating a polynomial at a point and Horner's rule<br/>5.2 Using interpolating polynomials<br/>5.2.1 Approximating values using interpolating polynomials<br/>5.2.2 Approximating derivatives using interpolating polynomials</p><p><strong>Week 5</strong><br/>5.2.3 Approximating integrals using interpolating polynomials<br/>5.3 Least-squares best-fitting polynomials<br/>5.3.1 Approximating a point using least-squares best-fitting polynomials<br/>5.3.2 Approximating the derivative using least-squares best-fitting polynomials<br/>5.3.3 Approximating an integral using least-squares best-fitting polynomials</p><p><strong>Week 6</strong><br/>6 Approximating solutions to algebraic equations<br/>6.1 Approximating the solution to the quadratic equation<br/>6.2 Approximating solutions to non-linear algebraic equations<br/>6.2.1 Newton's method<br/>6.2.2 The bisection method<br/>6.2.3 The bracketed secant method<br/>6.2.4 The secant method<br/>6.2.5 Muller's method<br/>6.2.6 Inverse quadratic interpolation<br/>6.3 Approximating solutions to systems of linear equations<br/>6.3.1 The Gauss-Seidel method<br/>6.3.2 The method of successive over-relaxation</p><p><strong>Week 7</strong><br/>6.4 Approximating solutions to systems of non-linear equations<br/>6.4.1 Newton's method in n dimensions<br/>7 Approximating solutions to analytic equations<br/>7.1 Approximating solutions to ordinary differential equations (ODEs)<br/>7.1.1 Approximating solutions to initial-value problems (IVPs)<br/>7.1.1.1 Approximating solutions to first-order IVPs<br/>7.1.1.1.1 Euler's method</p><p><strong>Week 8</strong><br/>7.1.1.1.2 Heun's method<br/>7.1.1.1.3 The 4th-order Runge-Kutta method<br/>7.1.1.1.4 Error analysis of these methods<br/>7.1.1.2 Adaptive techniques for 1st-order initial-value problems (IVPs)<br/>7.1.1.2.1 Adaptive Euler-Heun method<br/>7.1.1.2.2 Adaptive Dormand-Prince method</p><p><strong>Week 9</strong><br/>7.1.1.3 Approximating solutions to systems of 1st-order IVPs<br/>7.1.1.4 Approximating solutions to higher-order IVPs<br/>7.1.1.5 Approximating solutions to systems of higher-order IVPs<br/>7.1.2 Approximating solutions to boundary-value problems<br/>7.1.2.1 The shooting method</p><p><strong>Week 10</strong><br/>7.1.2.2 The finite-difference method<br/>7.1.2.3 Neumann and insulated boundary conditions<br/>7.2 Approximating solutions to partial differential equations<br/>7.2.1 The heat equation in one dimension</p><p><strong>Week 11</strong><br/>7.2.2 The wave equation in one dimension<br/>7.2.3 Laplace's equation<br/>8 Optimization<br/>8.1 Optimizing functions of a real variable<br/>8.1.1 Step-by-step optimization<br/>8.1.2 Newton's method for finding extrema</p><p><strong>Week 12</strong><br/>8.1.3 The golden-ratio search<br/>8.1.4 Successive parabolic interpolation<br/>8.2 Optimizing functions of a vector variable<br/>8.2.1 Hooke-Jeeves method<br/>8.2.2 Newton's method for finding extrema in n dimensions<br/>8.2.3 Gradient descent</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  MOSS: Source-code matching software (MOSS) may be used to screen assignments in this course. MOSS is used to verify that all source code in projects is not plagiarized from peers either from this offering or previous offerings of this course. Students' submissions are stored on a server in the United States of America at Stanford University for a period not exceeding one month, therefore students will be given an alternative of having the instructor personally investigate the similarity of their submissions with those of others students.<br/><br/>It is the responsibility of a student to notify the instructor in the first week of term if that student wishes that the instructor personally investigate the similarity of that student's submissions to other.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Supremacy of the final examination grade: </strong>Any project or mid-term examination grade will be replaced by the grade on the final examination if the grade on the final examination is higher than the grade for a specific project or the mid-term examination. For example, if nothing is submitted throughout the term, your grade on the final-examination will be your final grade. This policy, however, will not be applied if a grade on a project or the mid-term examination is the result of a Policy 71 investigation.</p><p><strong>Extensions: </strong>There will be no extensions granted in this course. If any component of this course is missed, the missing grade will be automatically replaced by the final examination grade as described in the previous point.</p><p><strong>Generative artificial intelligence: </strong>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as software design and development. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of GenAI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes.
