<div>
<p>The principles of automatic control are employed throughout many branches of engineering:  </p><ul><li>in analog electronics, feedback makes amplifier gains less sensitive to variations in transistor parameters, and improves input and output impedances and frequency response;</li><li>in chemical and mechanical engineering applications, automatic controllers regulate temperatures, pressures and flow rates against a range of disturbances;</li><li>robots robustly perform high-speed, precision manufacturing operations by means of numerous feedback controllers acting in concert to adjust respective joint angles;</li><li>autopilots control the altitudes of aircraft and damp out undesirable oscillations that are difficult or impossible for human pilots to manage;</li><li>automobiles incorporate computer-based ignition, emission control, braking and cruise control systems, and some, of course, are self-driving;</li><li>satellite communications are made possible through the precise orientation of antennas and satellites; etc.</li></ul><p>This course is an introduction to these valuable engineering principles.  It concentrates on the central topic of feedback, and its effects on the key properties of:  </p><ul><li>system stability; </li><li>'tracking' of <i>reference inputs</i>, through the manipulation of <i>control inputs; </i></li><li>regulation against uncontrolled <i>disturbance inputs; </i></li><li>robustness of system behaviour with respect to variation of system parameters.</li></ul><p>The mathematical framework is that of linear time-invariant systems -- in both the time and frequency domains; the main system model is the transfer-function representation of single-input, single-output systems.</p><p>Within this framework, the course develops the elements of "classical" analysis and design of feedback control systems.  Largely based on informed trial and error, classical control is a practical approach, and admits the use of engineering intuition.  Newer methods may be more systematic, but the techniques of classical control are essential to an understanding of the application of feedback, and are important elements of the control engineer's 'toolbox'.  </p><p>See the lab course outline, on Learn, for a description of the lab component of the course.  </p>
