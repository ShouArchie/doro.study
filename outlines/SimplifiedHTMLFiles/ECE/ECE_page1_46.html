  Instructor &amp; TA (Teaching Assistant) Information
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>About Prof. Zarnett</strong></p><p>I graduated from the Computer Engineering program at Waterloo (under a previous curriculum), and have since earned my Master's Degree (also at Waterloo) and my P.Eng. license. For the last 11+ years I have also been teaching here at UW and the other courses I have taught and worked on include ECE 150, ECE 155, ECE 252, ECE 254, ECE 290, ECE 350, ECE 356, SE 350, and ECE 459. All software and also the law and ethics course one time -- let's discuss contract law if you're up for it?. The fastest way to reach me about course material is a Piazza post, or e-mail for other things, because I tend to respond to these things much faster but also because other people probably have the same question.</p><p><strong>About Prof. Lam</strong></p><p>Way back when, I put Computer Engineering on my OUAC form. Then I got the AIF in the mail and decided I didn't want to study Computer Engineering after all. Yet here I am! I'm an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Some of you will know me as the previous Director of Software Engineering from back when you were in 1A. I studied math/CS yet convinced PEO to license me as a P.Eng.</p><p>Professoring is my full time day job. My research interests focus on using compiler and static analysis techniques to ensure program correctness. We'll touch on that at some points in this term. An important part of the reason I chose this day job is to help students. The best way to do that is by talking. I really enjoy talking to students when they come by my office (when I'm in my office, the door is almost always open). In any case: you can always email me at <code>patrick.lam@uwaterloo.ca</code> and schedule 1) an outdoor walk on campus ("walk as a service'"); 2) a meeting; or 3) a video call, if you'd like to talk to a 2D image of me on your screen.</p><p><strong>About Dr. Aajami, Lab Instructor</strong></p><p>We have a lab instructor this term, Mojtaba Aajami &lt;m2aajami@uwaterloo.ca&gt;. The LI is responsible for technical matters related to the assignments: git.uwaterloo.ca, git in general, administering the systems where you need to run your labs. Here's his bio:</p><p>I received my PhD from Yonsei University (South Korea) in Wireless Networks.</p><p>I’ve spent the last decade in academia, primarily in Iran, researching the intersection of wireless networks and machine learning techniques.</p><p>I love math and history. And I enjoy engaging in discussions about these fields.</p><p><strong>Teaching Assistants</strong></p><p>Teaching assistants can help you with the course material, including assignments and exams. They will do most of the assignment marking.</p><p>Huy Trinh &lt;h3trinh@uwaterloo.ca&gt;<br/>Md Rezwanul Haque &lt;mr3haque@uwaterloo.ca&gt;<br/>Thanushon Sivakaran &lt;tsivakar@uwaterloo.ca&gt;<br/>Soomin Shin &lt;s24shin@uwaterloo.ca&gt;<br/>Aman Bhagat &lt;a3bhagat@uwaterloo.ca&gt;</p>

  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ECE 459:</div>
<p>Profiling computer systems; bottlenecks, Amdahl's law. Concurrency: threads and locks. Techniques for programming multicore processors; cache consistency. Transactional memory. Streaming architectures, vectorization, and SIMD. High-performance programming languages.</p>

<div>
<p>Many modern software systems must process large amounts of data, either in the form of huge data sets or vast numbers of (concurrent) transactions.  This course introduces students to techniques for profiling, rearchitecting, and implementing software systems that can handle industrial-sized inputs. These techniques will enable you to design and build critical software infrastructure, especially in an age of Big Data.</p><p>While you may have seen some of these ideas in the context of operating systems (ECE350/SE350/CS350/MTE241) and concurrency (ECE252/CS343), this course gives you tools to make code run faster. The focus in OS/concurrency is understanding and implementing the primitives; our focus is on using them effectively.</p><p>We will sometimes see implementation details that you need to get right to write certain applications, but as with any university-level course, this course focusses more on the concepts than magic invocations, so that you can continue to apply the basic ideas after the technologies inevitably change. For instance, 2021 was the first year that this course was in Rust (rather than C and C++), but the core content remains the same.</p><p><strong>A note about prerequisites.</strong> To put the prerequisites in less formal terms: remember when we talked about semaphores and mutexes and all of that? If not, please review  <a href="https://github.com/jzarnett/ece252/tree/master/lectures">https://github.com/jzarnett/ece252/tree/master/lectures</a> and its video form at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFCH6yhq9yAHFaI00FrrgG0dPg8a5SjTJ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFCH6yhq9yAHFaI00FrrgG0dPg8a5SjTJ</a>. (Or you can look at CS 343 material). Also, I really hope you feel comfortable with programming. This isn’t the place for you if you’re not feeling conﬁdent in programming. Really. We’re going to learn a new language (Rust!) so if you don’t feel comfortable with the fundamentals of programming and if learning a new language is frightening then ﬂee while you can!</p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>We have three sections of the course, held at diﬀerent times. We don’t mind if you prefer to attend a diﬀerent section other than the one that appears on your schedule of courses, depending on your preference. </p><p>There will not be a midterm exam in this course.</p><p>The ﬁnal exam will happen during the ﬁnal exam period. Look for it in the registrar’s oﬃce schedule.</p><p><strong>Schedule Oddities</strong>: Reading Week is scheduled for Feb 15–23. We encourage you to take at least some days out of the reading week pauses to rest and recharge. In principle, 3rd and 4th year classes don't happen on the day of Capstone Project Symposia. However, there are a lot of programs represented in our course, to the point where no single program accounts for more than half of the students. Therefore we are not cancelling classes. We understand if you are going to miss it. We're also aware that IRS will be a thing.</p><p>This year, ECE is having a midterm week February 24–28. There will be no ECE 459 lectures and no ECE 459 midterm. Because each section loses two lectures during midterm week, ECE also schedules 3 or 4 extra ("makeup") lecture slots so that we can reach 36 hours of content. We intend to use these slots until we reach the end of the course material. The nice thing about the makeup lectures for LEC 003 in particular is that I will be able to introduce Rust a bit earlier in the term than normally, which will enable you to start on Assignment 1 sooner.</p><p>LEC 002 lecture will be cancelled on Friday, March 7. At this point, it looks like LEC 002 and LEC 003 will both finish on March 31st, due to the makeup lectures.</p><p><strong>Final Exam:</strong> The ﬁnal exam period is Apr 9–26. There will be a Registrar‐scheduled written ﬁnal exam scheduled somewhere between those dates; same drill as for the other courses.</p>

<p>This course includes assignments and a final examination. Too many fourth-year courses have projects, as well as that Capstone Design Project. This tends to make the end of term unmanageable, exactly when peak senioritis may be occuring. We won't contribute to that problem too much.</p><p><strong>Exams. </strong>Exams will be open‐book, open‐notes. The University rules say if you do not submit the ﬁnal exam, without an acceptable reason, your grade in the class will be DNW—Did Not Write. This is very undesirable. Please show up for the ﬁnal exam.</p><p>Special rule related to the ﬁnal exam: you need to get a grade of at least 30% on the ﬁnal exam to pass the course. If your grade for the ﬁnal exam is less than 30%, all your assignment grades are cut in half, so your maximum grade for the course will be 43%.</p><p><strong>Assignments. </strong>We will give you a grade of INC (Incomplete) if you do not attempt all assignments. If you do not complete the assignments within 4 months of the end of the course to the satisfaction of the course instructor, the Registrar’s Oﬃce will automatically convert your INC (Incomplete) grade to FTC (Failure to Complete), a failing mark. If you complete the assignments successfully within the required timeframe, we will calculate the overall grade using the rules for late assignment submission. Furthermore, any submitted assignment must be an honest attempt—submitting an empty project or similar is not adequate.</p><p>Since this course has “programming” in the title, you will be expected to write code for these assignments. Here is a list of assignments for this course. We have 4 assignments as below:</p><ol><li>Rust familiarization and use of nonblocking I/O;</li><li>Optimizing log ﬁle analytics;</li><li>GPU programming with CUDA;</li><li>Open‐ended program improvement via proﬁling.</li></ol><p>Assignment instructions will be posted on LEARN (and also on the course github), and assignment hand‐in will be done via git using the university‐provided <a href="https://git.uwaterloo.ca">https://git.uwaterloo.ca</a> (Gitlab) service. You need to set up your account in the Gitlab service as soon as possible to get access to the starter code for your ﬁrst assignment.</p><p>Auto‐grading and auto‐feedback systems, including marmoset, may be used for the evaluation of some of your assignments.</p><p>You’ll have at least two weeks to do each assignment. Trying to place the assignment due dates in the term is hard. We try to avoid FYDP deadlines, not place them on top of midterms, keep them vaguely in sync with the course material covered so far, and ﬁnally we’re not allowed to make the due date for them during reading week or after the end of term. Oh, and because there are so many students from so many programs, it is eﬀectively impossible to pick a date that works for everyone. Apologies in advance. That’s why there are grace days (see below).</p><p><strong>Lateness. </strong>Also known as “Grace Days”. You have ﬁve (5) days of lateness to use on submissions throughout the term. Each day you hand in something late consumes one of the days of lateness. Grace days are counted in units of whole days, so if you submit 2 hours late that’s 1 grace day, and if you submit 22 hours late that is still 1 grace day. We look at the last commit time in Gitlab on the default branch to determine when your code was submitted.</p><p>If you use too many grace days, here’s what happens. The sixth day of lateness causes your lowest assignment mark to be halved. The seventh day causes your lowest two assignment marks to be halved. If you have more than seven days of lateness, we’ll start converting marks to 0 and dropping the associated late days.</p><p>You don’t get any credit for unused late days. Also, grace days are tracked in Learn for transparency.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Your assignment code will be checked for plagiarism using MOSS (Measure Of Software Similarity) as well as some manual checks; MOSS results are subject to human judgment. You may request to opt out of the automatic screening by sending a formal written letter to your instructor explaining why; a meeting will then follow to discuss the subject with the instructor.<br/><br/>Group Work. You may discuss assignments with others, but we expect each of you to do each assignment independently. Acceptable collaboration includes discussing ideas and structures with others, as well as helping others debug their code. If your code is too close in structure to someone else's code, you are going to have a problem. The best way to avoid such problems is by (1) not sending your code around; and (2) not writing down anything beyond general notes (pseudocode) about other peoples' code. We will follow UW's Policy 71 if we discover any cases of plagiarism (and we have). Under this policy, the instructor may have follow-up conversations with individual students to ensure that the work submitted was completed on their own. Any follow-up may be conducted remotely (e.g., MS Teams, Skype, phone) or in person, depending on the situation.<br/><br/>We want to emphasize that we take the issue of plagiarism very seriously, and so does the University of Waterloo. If you are uncertain about this subject, please seek some guidance. There are many resources available to you. You can check the university policies, talk to the course instructor, ECE/SE undergrad office, et cetera.<br/><br/>Or, let's sum this up in two short instructions:<br/>1. Acknowledge the work of others. <br/>2. If you are uncertain, ask!

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Generative AI.</strong></p><p>The teaching team is keenly aware of the existence of generative AI (e.g., Github Copilot, ChatGPT) and how such tools can be used to write and test code. This is not a bad thing; IDEs, autocomplete, compilers, libraries, and tools like linters or Valgrind have existed for a long time and can all help you to write your code in an eﬃcient way by doing things for you that at one time you had to do manually. We know that banning them does not work (how could we check that, even?) and in reality (co‐op or full time employment), you’ll not only use these things, but might be less productive than your colleagues if you do not (but it depends on the tool!). So–we trust you to use these things responsibly. What does using generative AI responsibly mean?</p><p>Our asks on this are two simple things. The ﬁrst is that you should acknowledge if you used code given to you by an AI tool, just as you would if you found something on a website somewhere. The second thing is that you should use the tool(s) to help you, not do it all for you. This means you should understand the output it gives you and can verify that it is correct (remember that this is your professional responsibility under the law). Keep in mind that AI models are subject to “hallucinations” (making things up that aren’t true or aren’t real) and errors (bugs, vulnerabilities).</p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><p><strong>Piazza.</strong></p><p>Piazza is a great tool for collaboration and it allows rapid but asynchronous exchange of information. It almost goes without saying, but we ask you to be respectful and polite when communicating via this medium and to assume the best about others, as tone can be diﬃcult to interpret on a discussion forum.</p><p>Before posting your question, please consider whether this question can be answered by looking at either the course notes, lab manual, or documentation available on the internet (e.g., man pages). To help others ﬁnd answers later, (1) we discourage screenshot‐only posts (since the content does not show up in search results) and (2) we encourage you to please restrict a single thread to one question (or a closely‐related set of questions).</p><p>For the most part, we encourage (but do not require) you to make your question(s) public so that other students may beneﬁt from the answer. If something was non‐obvious or unclear to you, it was likely to others as well. If your question includes detailed design information or code excerpts related to a deliverable (e.g., an assignment), then please do make it a private question.</p><p>Please also keep in mind that course staﬀ may not be able to answer your question immediately as they have many other responsibilities throughout the term (and the frequency of questions tends to spike before due dates or exams). We encourage you to think through the problem before posting, but acknowledge that just like “rubber duck debugging” sometimes the act of writing down the nature of the problem provides insight into solving it.</p><p><strong>Re‐marking. </strong>If you believe that your grade on an assignment is incorrect, you may ask that it be re‐marked. To request that a question be re‐marked, you will need to submit your request in writing via e‐mail to the instructor.</p><p>When you submit your request, it should include the following: (1) your name and student ID number; (2) a clear indication of which question or part of the deliverable is to be re‐marked; and (3) an explanation of why you believe the grade assigned was incorrect.</p><p>Requests for re‐marking may be submitted any time before the ﬁnal exam. Be forewarned: when a deliverable is being re‐marked, your grade could go up, it could stay the same, or it could go down. You will be notiﬁed of the outcome.</p><p><strong>Extra Credit. </strong>In this class, there will be no opportunities to earn extra credit. Make‐up assignments or examinations will not be oﬀered under any circumstances.</p><p><strong>Attendance &amp; Illness. </strong>There are video lectures, but we can’t make you watch them. In fact, I [PL] don’t know whether I would actually watch all the hours of lectures if I was taking the class (I hate video). The lecture notes are the source material for the video lectures and also contain much of the information that we say. Thus, you have some options to choose the materials that work best for you. As you’ve surely noticed by now, at university, there is a lot that you have to learn on your own by doing assignments.</p><p>We do hope, though, that you stay on top of the material throughout the term and don’t try to cram it all before the ﬁnal exam/assignments. That’s why the assignment deadlines are spread throughout the term. </p><p>If you feel ill, you should seek appropriate medical attention. If you are feeling unwell during the exam, you should complete the self‐declaration of illness form or get a declaration of illness form signed. If you anticipate missing a deliverable deadline or an examination for a non‐medical reason, you should contact your instructor as soon as you are aware of the problem. Given suﬃcient notice, alternate arrangements may be possible. Alternate arrangements are rare and at instructor discretion. Still, we understand that emergencies happen, and pledge to be understanding.</p><p>If one of the instructors should be ill, we’ll either revert that section to online lectures only during the aﬀected period, or have the other instructor cover the lectures. We are certainly not going to show up while ill, and you should not either.</p><p><strong>Laptop and Device Policy. </strong>The human visual system has evolved to perceive saber‐toothed tigers in the savannah. Fortunately, tigers are rare in Waterloo, Ontario (Geese, on the other hand...). Unfortunately, your classmates are still human and hence their attention will be drawn to ﬂashing lights (or Tiktok, or movies, or video games) in their peripheral vision. We encourage everyone to be respectful of their classmates and to not distract them.</p><p>Wise use of computers and the Internet can be helpful for fully engaging in class. You might want to try out some syntax, or you might want to look up constructors, or you might want to verify your instructor’s somewhat outrageous‐sounding claim.</p><p>To support the beneﬁts of the Internet while reducing distractions, we will adopt the following policy for in‐person lectures in this class. We are asking that the ﬁrst 2 rows of class be text‐oriented: if using a device, use a command prompt or text editor, maximized to the whole screen. Paper is always good, of course. Mac OS X and UNIX command prompts are probably your best bet; for those of you on Windows, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux. From the command prompt, you can use compilers and text‐mode web browsers (w3m, lynx, links/elinks, etc....) tmux may also be helpful in managing multiple terminal sessions. Being proﬁcient with the terminal is a highly‐useful skill for a Software Engineer.</p><p>We acknowledge that lectures are not always engaging. Instead of distracting screen content, we recommend non‐distracting ways of tuning out, like doodling on paper (while taking notes), or doing homework. (we also recommend passing notes to each other instead of talking).</p><p>If you need to sit towards the front of the class and use a GUI program, then please discuss with your instructor to register yourself as an exception. If you sign up for the exception list, we’ll ask to you agree to not display games, videos, or social media on your screen (unless it is part of the class).</p><p>Enforcement is a sensitive issue, especially given the existence of exceptions. We are primarily asking each of you to respect the policy on your own. But, if you see someone with games, videos, or social media in the terminal zone, you can politely bring it up with them.</p><p>tl;dr: paper or text‐oriented programs in ﬁrst 2 rows of class during regular lectures (not in‐class exercises).</p><h4><strong>Faculty of Engineering Guiding Practices</strong></h4><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.
