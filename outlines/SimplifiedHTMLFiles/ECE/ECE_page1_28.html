Assignments are graded fairly leniently. Try not to worry about grades too much and just focus on getting practice. The following are some details:</p><p>* There will be no extensions or late assignments accepted. As compensation for this rather harsh rule, I will drop your assignment with lowest score when calculating the assignment average. To be fair to all students, requests for extension receive the following “canned” response:</p><p><i>The course policy is that there are no extensions for assignments. As compensation, I will automatically drop your lowest assignment grade of the six.</i></p><p>* Assignments are submitted using Crowdmark https://app.crowdmark.com/sign-in/waterloo.</p><p>* Programming exercises are written in Python3, and your code is to be submitted in the corresponding Dropbox on LEARN.</p><p><strong>Schedule for deliverables: </strong></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Deliverable</td><td>Date released</td><td>Date due</td></tr><tr><td>Assignment 1</td><td>Mon Jan 06</td><td>Fri Jan 17</td></tr><tr><td>Assignment 2</td><td>Mon Jan 20</td><td>Fri Jan 31</td></tr><tr><td>Assignment 3</td><td>Mon Feb 03</td><td>Fri Feb 14</td></tr><tr><td>Midterm exam</td><td>N/A</td><td>Thu Feb 27</td></tr><tr><td>Assignment 4</td><td>Mon Feb 24</td><td>Fri Mar 07</td></tr><tr><td>Assignment 5</td><td>Mon Mar 10</td><td>Fri Mar 21</td></tr><tr><td>Assignment 6</td><td>Mon Mar 24</td><td>Fri Apr 04</td></tr><tr><td>Final exam</td><td>N/A</td><td>TBA by Registrar's Office</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>For assignments, <strong>turn your work in by 11:59pm on the due date</strong>.

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  * Assignments are to be submitted individually and must be written in your own words. You are free to collaborate with other students on assignments in order to hash out initial solution ideas. You must list these collaborators at the top of the first page of your assignment (there is no penalty for listing collaborators, but it ensures we do not falsely identify plagiarism).<br/><br/>* Cite all sources used in your solutions (other than the course notes or the main textbook). In submitting an assignment, you are “signing off on your work” as described in the academic integrity form at https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/. The penalty for a first plagiarism offence is -100% for the assignment.<br/><br/>* Each student must turn in a signed academic integrity form to confirm their understanding of the above policies. Only one such form is required for the whole term, and serves as an integrity verification for all assignments.
</p>
<a></a>
<h2>
  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>I plan to record the lectures using the room camera pointed at the instructor's podium, and I will share the videos with the class. The recordings will serve as an optional study aid, and should not be used as a substitute for attending class (with the occasional exception of illness, co-op/job interviews, etc.) If you have a privacy concern about the lecture being recorded, please reach out to Prof. Creager.</p>
</div>
<a></a>
<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Use of AI: Do not use Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (Github Copilot, GPT-3, ChatGPT, Google Colab autocomplete, ...) to write your assignments for you. These tools are powerful, and you will have plenty of opportunities in your career improve your programming efficiency by using them. This course is not such an opportunity, as you should be getting practice solving problems yourself. Use of AI in this course will be treated as an academic integrity issue (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a>).</p><p>Outside of assignments, you are welcome to use AI tools as a study aid. But please be aware that they may give incorrect answers, such as inefficient pseudocode implementations, or erroneous runtime analyses of existing programs.</p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
