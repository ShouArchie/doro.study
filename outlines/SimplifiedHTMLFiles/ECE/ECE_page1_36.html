  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ECE 444:</div>
<p>Analog electronics exploits the physical behaviour of electronic devices to create electronic systems. The performance of single and multiple transistor amplifying stages are studied. Followed by a study of biasing, current mirror, and output stages, which are then combined in the study of operational amplifier circuits. Frequency response and feedback are then reviewed leading to a detailed study of stability and compensation for multistage and operational amplifiers. The course finishes with a look at selected topics from A/D (analog-to-digital) converters, oscillators, and phase-locked loops.</p>

<p><i>Instructor's Description:</i></p><p>Analog integrated circuits (ICs) exploit the physical behaviour of electronic devices to create electronic systems. We will study the performance of single- and multiple-transistor amplifying stages. This is followed by a study of biasing, current mirrors, and output stages, which are then combined in the study of operational amplifiers. We then review frequency response and feedback, leading to a detailed study of stability and compensation for multistage and operational amplifiers. We will mostly study complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, but will use bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) for certain applications. The course finishes with a look at switched-capacitor circuits and data converters, including analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs).</p><p>The knowledge and skills you will learn in this course will prepare you to:</p><ol><li>Work in industry as a hardware designer [e.g., design of printed-circuit board (PCB) level electronics].</li><li>Pursue graduate studies in IC design (this is usually necessary to work as an IC designer in industry).</li></ol><p> </p>

Submission through the VIF System, once approved, will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Rescheduling Co-op Interviews: </strong>Follow the co-op process for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts"><u>rescheduling co-op interviews</u></a> for conflicts to graded assignments (e.g., midterms, tests, and final exams). Attendance at co-operative work-term employment interviews is not considered to be a valid reason to miss a test.</p><p> </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as circuit simulation. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, code, circuit schematics, and simulation results like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>
