<p>The course grade will be based on quizzes and the project.</p><h3>Project</h3><p>The project can contribute to a maximum of 40% of the final grade G. The amount the project contributes to the final grade depends on the combined grade received in the quizzes. The project is split into 7 lab deliverables (PD)s. The distribution of marks for the project deliverables is as follows.</p><p>(PD0, PD1, PD2, PD3, PD4, PD5, PD6) = (1.2%, 2%, 2.8%, 4%, 10%, 10%, 10%)</p><p>Let us assume that LGi is the grade received out of 100 for the ith lab deliverable, PDi. For example, LG1 refers to the grade out of 100 received for PD1. We compute the lab marks L as</p><p>L = (LG1/100) ∗ 2 + (LG2/100) ∗ 3 + (LG3/100) ∗ 5 + ((LG4/100) + (LG5/100)) ∗ 30.</p><h3>Quizzes</h3><p>The quizzes contribute to a maximum of 60% of the final grade. Let Q1 and Q2 be the grades received out of 100 for quiz 1 and 2, respectively. We compute the marks received from examinations as</p><p>E = MAX((25 ∗ Q1/100 + 35 ∗ Q2/100), (15 ∗ Q1/100 + 45 ∗ Q2/100)).</p><h3>Final grade</h3><p>We compute your final course grade G as follows.</p><p>• If E ≤ 24, then your course grade G = E. This means that your project counts for 0 if you are unable to achieve a combined 24 out of 60 of the quiz marks. Note that 24 is 40% of the quiz component E.</p><p>• If E ≥ 30, then your course grade is G = E + L. This means that your project counts for L if you achieve a combined 30 out of 60 of the quiz marks. Note that 30 is 50% of the examination component E.</p><p>• If 24 &lt; E &lt; 30, then G = E + ((E − 24)/6) ∗ L.</p><p>The instructor reserves the right to adjust the weights of any of the quizzes and project components, as well as curving the final marks. The instructor also reserves the right to update and adjust the deadlines and schedule.</p><h4> </h4><p> </p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Late project submissions</h4><p>Every PD is due on or before the deadline. If for any reason you are unable to submit it by the deadline, you would receive a 0 for that PD. In order to recover a maximum of 50% of the marks for the respective PD, you will be able to submit it until the last day of class. We will only re-evaluate it after the last day of class. For example, if you miss the deadline for PD3, then you can receive a maximum of 2.5% if it is submitted before the last day of class. Of course, we would evaluate it and assess the grade for the late submission.</p><h4>Missed quiz 1</h4><p>A student missing the quiz 1 will receive a score of 0 for that quiz. If the student provides appropriate documentation (e.g. verification of illness form) within 48 hours of the exam and it is accepted by the instructor, then quiz 2 will weigh 60%. This means the weight of quiz 1 gets shifted to quiz 2. Therefore, E = 60 ∗ F.</p><h4>Missed quiz 2</h4><p>A student missing only quiz 2 will receive a score of 0 for quiz 2. If the student provides appropriate documentation within 48 hours of the final exam and it is accepted by the instructor, then the student will receive a grade of INC, and the student will have to complete the requirement of quiz 2 for future a offering of ECE621 one year later.</p><h4>Review of quiz 1</h4><p>Review of quiz 1 must occur within 2 weeks of the return of the grades for the quiz. The request must be made in writing. You will need to state the questions that should be reconsidered, and reasons for it. Note that later requests for re-assessments will not be honoured.</p><h4>Academic violations</h4><p>Any violations of academic honesty and integrity policies will result in receiving a 0 for the corresponding assessment, and an additional −5% will be assessed on the final grade. Multiple infractions will incur multiple reductions on the final grade.</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
