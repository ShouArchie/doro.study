<p><strong>Course Project:</strong></p><p>The objective of the course project is for the students to get hands-on software development experience with agile practices and apply some of the concepts taught in the course, including agile requirements management, testing, software design and architecture, collaborative development and versioning, and continuous integration.</p><p>Students will form teams of four to six members and complete a software project of their choice. The project must involve writing code to develop a software system, but it may also have additional, secondary aspects besides software development, such as dealing with specialized hardware (e.g., microcontroller, sensors, etc.), designing graphics (e.g., for a game), or performing user surveys or interviews (e.g., to gather requirements for a target audience). The team may select a particular topic, because, for example, the team members have interest in a particular application domain or want to learn certain technologies. If there is an actual customer, it can greatly help to focus the project effort, but it is not required. The default team size is four members; however, teams with five or six members are just fine; three members would be acceptable; two members is not a team; and seven and more would be too big of a team. A larger team is expected to accomplish more results than a smaller one; however, in practice, the output does not scale linearly with the team size because of the inherent communication and coordination overhead; thus, for example, a team of six is expected to deliver substantially more results than a team of three, but not exactly twice as much.</p><p>The project must use modern agile development practices. These include (but are not limited to):</p><ol><li>using a modern version control system in the cloud, such as gitlab or github. Consider using gitlab hosted by UW at https://git.uwaterloo.ca/;</li><li>practicing agile project management using a Kanban or task board, with user stories and proper task scoping; the aspect can be implemented using the existing task management functionality in gitlab or github or in another system like Asana;</li><li>regular and effective communication among the team—at least semi-weekly scrum meetings, and otherwise regular team communication via tools like MS Teams (available to every UW student for free by logging in to UW Office 365 portal using your UW credentials at <a href="http://portal.office.com">portal.office.com</a>) or Slack;</li><li>unit and integration tests (which may also require specialized test framework for graphical user interfaces if part of the system); possibly continuous integration; and</li><li>code contributions from every member of the team. </li></ol><p>The choice of specific technologies (platforms, frameworks, libraries) is entirely up to the team.</p><p>Teams will meet with the instructor for a review (according to the table below) and for a final delivery at the end of the term.</p>

The abstract should be roughly half-a-page long in PDF. A more detailed project selection and abstract submission guide is provided on LEARN. As you start your development, you do not have to stick exactly to what you have proposed originally—you have the flexibility to adjust the topic and scope, or even pivot, as you gain experience. If you pivot, submit a new abstract.

<p>The nominal grading scheme is Variant 1 (shown above), assuming in-person final exam. As a contingency, Variant 2 is provided should the final exam be required to be online (e.g., due to a pandemic). </p><p><strong>Variant 2 (Online final exam):</strong></p><ul><li>Course project - 70%</li><li>Final exam - 30%</li></ul><p><strong>Project grading:</strong></p><p>There is no detailed grading scheme for the project. Projects and student background vary significantly. <strong>The project will be assessed holistically based on ambition, organization, professionalism, systematic application of agile practices, and results in terms of functionality and quality delivered, and effective communication of the result to the instructor.</strong> </p><p>Having said that, there are three components that flow into your mark for a midterm project review and the final delivery review:</p><ol><li><strong>Process</strong> (roughly 40%): Effort, effective use of time, knowledge and application of the concepts covered in the course, effective project management and development practices, team contract in place; professionalism (e.g., submitting deliverables on time, attention to detail and quality). Students are expected to follow agile practices introduced during lectures (agile project management; users stories; automated unit, integration and system testing; collaborative versioning using git; continuous integration); in particular, user stories, a Kanban board, issue discussions, and functionality and test code contributions must be hosted on a collaborative version system such as gitlab or github. Teams must meet regularly throughout the term, executing 2-3 week iterations/sprints. The minimum is to have a weekly scrum meeting, better two, plus additional ad-hoc meetings to address specific technical project issues as needed.</li><li><strong>Results</strong> (roughly 40%): Artifacts produced (tangible or conceptual, e.g., code, requirements, plans, design, etc.), significance of the artifacts to the project objectives and success, quality of the outcomes, ambition about functionality scope and technical depth, and volume / quantity of the results. All team members are expected to contribute the project results, with comparable effort.</li><li><strong>Communication</strong> (roughly 20%): Well-prepared presentation (delivered life or as a video during the midterm review or final delivery meeting), clearly explaining the project functionality, performing an effective software demonstration, clearly explaining the practices followed, and contributions from every team member. During the project review meetings, I will want to see your results, such as a demo of the implemented functionality, the code and tests in the git repository, evidence of regular team meetings and effective communication among team members, evidence of continuous and effective project management via a task board, and contributions from every team member. </li></ol><p>Assuming <strong>Variant 1</strong> of the grading scheme, <strong>10% of the mark will be awarded during the progress review and 45% during the final delivery meeting; </strong>and assuming<strong> Variant 2, it will be 15% and 55%, respectively.</strong></p><p>The team will receive a single project mark for the team effort as a whole, that is, <strong>the mark for the project component will be the same for each team member, </strong>but each member is expected to make their fair contribution to the team effort. However, I reserve the right to apply demerit points to the project grade of an individual team member, should there be evidence of a student not contributing their fair share of effort to the project. Team members are expected to establish the team contract and honor their commitments throughout the term.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Course Policies</h4><p><strong>Collaboration &amp; Plagiarism</strong>:<strong> </strong>Plagiarism, taking credit for work that others did, is not permitted, and this applies to source code as well as exams. The course staff will be checking for it through a variety of different methods. Any cases of plagiarism I detect will be reported, according to university policy (see the University Policy section below).</p><p>As you will work in your team on your project, you may use any online resources for design and implementation ideas. You can reuse existing libraries as it is common in software development, and you may also reuse code fragments from online resources, such as stackoverflow, as long as you respect the copyrights that come with the sources. You may also build on an existing project, e.g., code that was previously developed by one of the team members, but you must declare any such code and not take any credit for it for this course. The team members are expected to collaborate and contribute to the project, but a single mark will be awarded for the project results for the team (i.e., same project mark for each team member).</p><p><strong>No collaboration of any kind is permitted during exams. I reserve the right to set up a video recording during the in-person final exam in order to review and detect any potential communication between students in violation of the no-collaboration policy.</strong></p><p>I want to emphasize that I take the issue of plagiarism very seriously, and so does the University of Waterloo. If you are uncertain about this subject, please seek some guidance. There are many resources available to you. You can check the university policies (see the next section) and talk to the course instructor or teaching assistant.</p><p><strong>Use of generative AI</strong>: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) using large language models (LLM) or other methods trained to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Recommendations for how to cite GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library:</p><p> <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai">https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</a>.</p><p>Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee:</p><p> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</a></p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI.</p><p><strong>Late Submissions: </strong>Late deliverable submissions will not be accepted.</p><p><strong>Re-marking:</strong> If you believe that your grade on a written, submitted deliverable (e.g., an exam question) is incorrect or unfair, you may ask that it be re-marked. Presentations or demos cannot be re-marked.</p><p>To request that a question be re-marked, you will need to submit your request as a private post to the Instructor team (including the TAs) on Piazza, clearly indicating which question or part of the deliverable is to be re-marked and including an explanation of why you believe the grade assigned was incorrect.</p><p>I will accept items for re-marking any time before the final exam. Be forewarned, when a deliverable is being re-marked, your grade could go up, it could stay the same, or it could go down. I will notify you of the outcome.</p><p><strong>Extra Credit:</strong> In this class, there will be no opportunities to earn extra credit. Make-up projects or examinations will not be offered under any circumstances.</p><p><strong>Attendance</strong>: Scheduled in-person class activities give an opportunity to engage with the material in a group setting with your peers and also to interact directly with the instructor. That said, this is university and you are capable of deciding for yourself if you are going to the lecture or not. Attendance is not taken and not graded, except for when the in-class exercises or quizzes are administered or bonus points offered for guest lectures. </p><p><strong>Masking</strong>: The official university advice on masking from UW at the start of the term is that masks are strongly recommended but optional. This may change throughout the term. As for the interaction with the instructor, I will not be using a mask when presenting during lecture as I will be at a sufficient distance from students. However, when interacting with individual students I may be wearing a mask and would appreciate keeping sufficient distance to avoid the transmission of respiratory viruses. I would like to minimize the risk of infections during the term to avoid any disruptions in the course delivery. </p><h4><strong>Faculty of Engineering Guiding Practices</strong></h4><p><strong>Inclusive Teaching</strong>-<strong>Learning Spaces</strong>: The University of Waterloo values the diverse and intersectional identities of its students, faculty, and staff.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
