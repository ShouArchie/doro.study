<p>The grading scheme on the left-hand side applies only if you pass the final exam. In the case that the final exam grade is less than 50%, this will become your course grade.</p><p>Assignments</p><p>Assignments are designed to reinforce content covered during the lectures and tutorials. These multi-choice assignments will be administered with the start of a new unit through LEARN quizzes tool and can be accessed as many times as the student wish but have only one time attempt for submission. In addition, the students must submit the FULL SOLUTION on LEARN Dropbox. No late assignments will be accepted! Each assignment will be open for completion until the scheduled due date for approximately two (or three)-week-period, depending on the unit length. The assignments are evenly weighted from the total assignment mark. After the due date, the multi-choice assignments will be marked automatically through LEARN and the grades will be posted on the gradebook in LEARN. Some full solutions submission will be screened and checked by the TAs. The students will have access to the solution of the assignments after the grades are released.</p><p>Assignments due are at 11:59 PM on Fridays: (1) Jan. 24; (2) Feb. 7; (3) Mar. 14; &amp; (4) Apr 4.</p><p>ONLINE Quizzes and Final Exam</p><p>There will be two multiple-choice-question quizzes that will be administered using the LEARN quizzes tool. In addition, the students must submit the FULL SOLUTION on LEARN Dropbox. The quizzes will be available for 24-hour window, it will open at 12:00 am EST on the scheduled date and closed at 11:59 pm EST on the same day. Students will have two hours to submit their responses from the time they start the quiz. The quiz cannot be stopped or paused once it has been started. In general questions on the quizzes will not be answered during quiz time, however, there is exemption for technical questions. If you find that a quiz question is unclear, email your assumptions and a screenshot of the unclear quiz question to the instructor and/or the TAs within an hour of completing the quiz. The quizzes are evenly weighted to form the total quiz mark. Students can view their quiz marks on the gradebook in LEARN. No make-up quiz for missed one will be conducted. The mark of the missed quiz with an acceptable reason will be shifted toward the other quiz. During quiz you may consult your textbook, handwritten course notes, and materials posted in the course LEARN site. You may use any type of calculator. Use of any other resource is prohibited. You may not communicate directly or indirectly with any person except the course instructor or TA. Final exam will be determined by the registrar office and will happen during the final exam period.</p><p>Quizzes: (1) Tuesday, Feb 11, 2025; (2) Tuesday, Mar. 25, 2025;</p><p>Final Exam: TBD; during finals</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
