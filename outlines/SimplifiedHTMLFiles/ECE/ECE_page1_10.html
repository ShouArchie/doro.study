<p><strong>Written Assignments:</strong> There will be 8 written assignments. The assignments will be posted on Learn page at least one week prior the due date. Assignments must be scanned and submitted electronically via Crowdmark. They are due at 9:00 PM EDT on the Fridays of the weeks listed in the course schedule. Late submissions will not be accepted, regardless of  circumstances. <u>To account for short term absences, your lowest written assignment will be automatically dropped.</u><strong> </strong>This allows you to freely use your short term absence for your other classes. Written assignment problems <strong>must</strong> be completed without <strong>any</strong> outside help other than piazza posts and discussions with the instructor. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Midterm Exam :</strong> The midterm examination will be held on <strong>Monday, February 24</strong> <strong>from 12:30 to 1:45 PM.</strong> Information regarding the room and your seat will be distributed before the exam on Odyssey. This will be a <strong>closed book exam and no calculators allowed.</strong></p><p><strong>Missed Midterm assessment : </strong>There will be no make-up midterms. Any valid, documented, absences will result in the weight of the midterm being transferred to the final exam.</p><p>Your midterm schedule is available <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/midterm-schedule-0">here</a>. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Final Exam: </strong>The Final exam will be scheduled by the RO during the Final Examination Period. This will be a <strong>closed book exam and no calculators allowed. </strong></p><p>The schedule for final exams will be available <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/academics/final-examination-schedule">here</a> on January 31, 2025.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Tutorials</strong>: While students are not permitted to discuss the Written Assignment questions, students are encouraged to work on/discuss practice problems and tutorial problems with their peers. Additionally students are strongly encouraged to attend the tutorial sessions.</p><p> </p>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  The TAs and the instructor will examine the submissions for irregularities.

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Short-term Absences: </strong>If you submit a short-term absence for an assignment, that assignment will automatically count as your dropped assignment. This policy is why we decided to drop the lowest assignment. If you miss the midterm exam and use your short-term absence, its weight will be shifted to the final exam. There will be no make-up midterm.</p><p><strong>Verification of Illness Forms (VIF)</strong>: If you submit a VIF and you wish to be exempt for an assessment, here is what will happen. You must first contact your instructor, notifying them that you have submitted a VIF. </p><p>If you miss an assignment during the absence range, the weight from that assignment will be shifted to the other assignments. Explicitly, we will drop that assignment in addition to dropping your lowest assignment.</p><p>If you miss the midterm exam, its weight will be shifted to the final exam. There will be no make-up midterm.</p><p>Other accommodations are at the discretion of your instructor.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p>If a student sends the instructor a picture of an animal that they or their family/friends owns (along with a name), then I will do my best to include that animal as flavor text for an assignment and/or exam question. With explicit permission given, I may also use the Canny Edge detector to generate a sketch of said animal to include in the problem statement. Don't tell your fellow students about this clause --  it is more fun that way ;).</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
