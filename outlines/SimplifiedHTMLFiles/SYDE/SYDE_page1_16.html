<p>Your prior knowledge of elementary statistical modeling (STAT 231/241; SYDE212) and linear algebra (MATH 235/245) is <strong>necessary</strong> for this course. Given the large number of topics covered in this course, there will not be time to review these topics. Please <strong>refresh your knowledge on these topics</strong> from any of the courses you have taken before.</p><p>The <strong>course web page </strong>is available through <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca">LEARN</a> for the purpose of distributing all course materials and announcements. Please review your email and notification settings.<strong> </strong>I recommend you subscribe to notifications related to Announcements so you don’t miss any important information.</p><p>Registered students can enroll in the <strong>class discussion board</strong> through <a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/stat331_cuggenti_1251">Piazza</a>. Students are expected to use the Piazza discussion board to discuss course content with each other, the TAs, and the instructor. Post all questions about course content on Piazza instead of emailing the instructor, allowing us all to learn from each other. The policies for posting on Piazza are:</p><ol><li>Search for your question first before posting.</li><li>Keep your questions concise and specific.</li><li>Put relevant information in the subject line to make it easy for students to find your question. For example, use "Course Notes, Chapter 1, Q3 (b)".</li><li>Indicate what you have tried that did not work. For example, "I tried Exercise 4 and thought the solution should be ... but my solution is different from the solution provided. What is wrong with my solution?".</li><li>You can post questions while remaining anonymous to your fellow classmates if you'd like by clicking the “Show up as Anonymous” option. However, the instructor and TAs will be able to see your name.</li><li><strong>You must send a private message to the instructor/TAs if your question reveals part of an assignment solution.</strong></li><li>Do not expect a full solution to your question. You may be given a hint or suggestion as this helps with your learning.</li><li>The instructor/TAs will do our best to monitor the board and respond to questions during regular business hours (approx. Monday - Friday from 8:30am-4:30pm ET).</li><li>Students are encouraged to respond to questions and help each other.</li><li>We expect everyone to be respectful to each other. Any posts that do not meet with the principles in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33">Policy 33: Ethical Behaviour</a> will be removed.</li></ol><p>If you have a <strong>non-course content related question or concern</strong> you should feel free to email the instructor directly. Please send your emails from your uwaterloo.ca email address and include your student ID number.</p><h3>Course Expectations</h3><p>To help maintain a <i>safe, respectful, and productive community</i> in which we – students and teaching team alike – can take risks in our learning/teaching, tackle challenging concepts, and ultimately grow as learners, we should endeavor to follow these mutual expectations:</p><ul><li>Be prepared for class.</li><li>Be active and participate in class.</li><li>Be open to trying new ways to support learning.</li><li>Learn from mistakes and seek/review/provide feedback.</li><li>Promote an inclusive and safe learning environment.</li><li>Actively listen to and respect others in all class-related environments.</li><li>Ask and respond to questions/concerns in a timely manner (acknowledging busy times!).</li></ul><p> </p>

During lectures, students will annotate the material alongside the instructor. If you only annotate what the instructor annotates, then you are <i>missing out on important material.</i></p><p><strong>The instructor's annotated slides will typically not be posted following the lecture.</strong> If you miss lectures, then <i>you are responsible</i> for reaching out to a classmate in order to find out what was missed.</p><h4>Tutorials</h4><p>Tutorials will be used to introduce R/RStudio, provide further explanations/examples, discuss assessment solutions, review for exams, and ask questions about course content.</p><h4>Out-of-Class Workload</h4><p>As in any university course, much of your learning in this course will take place outside of class time. You should plan to spend between 3 and 6 hours each week in out-of-class learning. This learning consists mostly of making sure you understand the concepts and steps that were used in class to solve problems and then solve exercises from the textbook on your own.</p>

<h3>Assessments</h3><p>The evaluation is set up to promote <i>mastery of the materials/skills</i> listed above by the end of the course, and to provide <i>opportunities to learn from mistakes</i>. Note: There are several <a href="https://www.aeseducation.com/blog/formative-vs.-summative-assessments-what-do-they-mean">formative and summative assessments</a> used in this course to assist your learning. Please read the evaluation methods below carefully along with the descriptions of the assessments (<strong>WHY? WHAT? HOW?</strong>). If you have <i>any questions</i> about any of the assessments, please do not hesitate to ask during class, office hours, or on Piazza.</p><h4>Concept Quizzes:</h4><p><strong>WHY?</strong>  To promote: (i) engagement with the course material, (ii) self-reflection and metacognition, (iii) peer-to-peer interaction, (iv) summarization of what you are learning, and/or (v) progression tracking.</p><p><strong>WHAT?</strong>  Two (2) "two-part" quizzes consisting of an individual quiz (Part 1 - worth 1%) and a group quiz (Part 2 - worth 1.5%) for which students are encouraged to discuss their answers with classmates and ask questions of the teaching team. Some questions may be the same for both parts.</p><p><strong>HOW?</strong>  In-person and <i>partially</i> open book quizzes held on the tutorial dates listed in the schedule above.</p><h4>Assignments:</h4><p><strong>WHY?</strong>  To demonstrate your mastery of the learning outcomes in an authentic manner, including your use of the statistical software, R. See <a href="https://lib.uwaterloo.ca/web/assignment-planner/math-assignment">Math Assignment Planner</a>.</p><p><strong>WHAT?</strong>  Four (4) assignments, each composed of (typically) 1–5 questions requiring solving theoretical proofs, plots, R code and output, and/or written responses.</p><p><strong>HOW?</strong>  Submitted to Crowdmark and are due by 11:59pm ET on the tentative dates listed in the schedule above.</p><h4>Midterm Examination</h4><p><strong>WHY?</strong>  To serve as an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding, application, and integration of the course material, including practical application of the skills/concepts with the statistical software, R.</p><p><strong>WHAT?</strong>  One (1) midterm exam.</p><p><strong>HOW?</strong>  In-person and closed book exam held on the date listed in the schedule above from 6:30-8:00pm. Room and seat assignments will be accessible prior to the exam on <a href="https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/teaching/schedule">Odyssey</a>. </p><h4>Final Examination</h4><p>The 2.5-hour cumulative final examination will be scheduled by the Registrar’s Office and held during the University Exam Period. Please do not make any travel plans before the final exam schedule is posted.</p><ul><li><strong>Incompletes</strong>: Students who are unable to complete the final exam for a valid, documented reason will only be eligible for a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/incomplete-procedure">grade of incomplete</a> (INC) if they have completed course work - specifically assignments and midterm - during the term well enough that they could reasonably be expected to earn a passing mark in the course.</li></ul><h3>Assessment Policies</h3><h4>Late Submissions:</h4><ul><li>Assignments will be accepted up to two days late with a 25% penalty assigned to each 24-hour period after the deadline. Assignments more than 48 hours late will not be graded and will be given a grade of zero.</li></ul><h4>Missed Assessments:</h4><ul><li><u>Missed Assignment</u>: The time window to complete these assessments are generous and, in general, a sickness lasting a couple of days will not be enough of a reason to ask for alternative accommodations and/or extension. It is expected that you will use the whole time-window in its entirety to complete the assessment and not leave it for the last couple of days.</li><li><u>Missed Quiz/Midterm</u>: If you miss a quiz or the midterm for any reason (including self-isolation, short-term absence declaration, or other legitimate reasons), <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations/submission#how-to-declare">submit proper documentation</a> and contact the instructor within 48 hours of the missed assessment (within 24 hours of the missed assessment for short-term absences) so that you can be informed how/if you will be accommodated.</li></ul><h4>Remarking:</h4><ul><li>You may appeal the grading of an assessment by sending an email request to the instructor within one week of the date the assessment was returned.</li></ul><h3>Tips for Success</h3><ul><li>Lecture and tutorial attendance is strongly recommended.</li><li>A list of textbook homework problems are available on <a href="http://learn.uwaterloo.ca/">LEARN</a>.<ul><li>Completing problems from the course notes/textbook independently is necessary to develop and self-assess your understanding of the material.</li><li>Students should critically compare their work with available solutions and against the solutions of fellow classmates.</li><li>As course concepts are introduced, students should solve related problems from the course notes/textbook in a timely manner to assess and solidify their understanding.</li><li>For most students, working on these problems regularly and diligently is essential to success in the course.</li></ul></li><li>It is essential to ask for clarification promptly. You can ask questions during/after lectures and tutorials, on Piazza, or during office hours.</li><li>I highly recommend these <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources">educational resources</a> related to time management, study skills, and stress management, among other topics.</li><li>Reach out to me if you are having any trouble. I want you to succeed and I will do my best to support you in any way I can.</li></ul><p> </p>

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as mathematical proofs and the fitting, interpretation, and assessment of linear models in real applications. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
