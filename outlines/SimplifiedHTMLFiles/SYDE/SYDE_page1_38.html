<p>In July 2024, it was announced that the new regional hospital for Kitchener-Waterloo, a joint project of the Grand River Hospital and St. Mary’s General Hospital, would be located on north campus of the University of Waterloo (<a href="https://futureofcaretogether.ca/our-new-hospital/">https://futureofcaretogether.ca/our-new-hospital/</a>).  More than a physical state-of-the-art hospital is envisioned.  Transformational innovation in healthcare that embodies community, education, research and ultimately the complete tenets of sustainability is desired.  The coalition planning the hospital is in the functional programming phase.  The site plan is not yet determined.</p><p>One overarching goal of the coalition is to gather student conceptual designs that embody sustainability.  This class is structured as a collaborative forum within which students will undertake robust explorations of both sustainability concepts and hospital/health systems. </p><p>Three frameworks or tools ground the course in systems design engineering: </p><ul><li>defining sustainability (with metrics); </li><li>systems thinking (with mapping); and </li><li>structured design methods with a strong focus on problem definition and evaluation of alternative designs.  </li></ul><p>Students will develop and critically evaluate alternative site designs within the context of facilitating hospital sustainability.  Students will focus on one of the following aspects of sustainability:</p><ul><li>access and transportation; </li><li>green energy; or </li><li>integrated well-being with the surrounding community.</li></ul><p>Together as a learning collaborative, students, with the instructor, will contribute documentation to that will focus on the hospital through several products:</p><ul><li>Co-laboratory definitions of sustainability and hospital systems;</li><li>Notes on design elements raised by class lectures and invitedspeakers;</li><li>Summaries and reviews of hospital sustainability literature; </li><li>Short design reports of alternative hospital site designs; and</li><li>Posters for stakeholder review.</li></ul><p> </p>

<p>There is no textbook for the course. Successful contribution to the class will require completing assigned readings but the amount of reading varies from 0 pages in some weeks to as many as 60 pages.  In most cases, readings are reinforced by class and homework assignments.  In-class group discussions to hone main “take-home” messages are undertaken.  Readings can be found in the class schedule table.  Readings or links to readings can be found on LEARN.  They are labeled as either Required or Reference Resources.  Readings are required for approximately 11 classes in the term.  These readings are provided by pdf or link in LEARN.  No textbook is purchased.</p>

<p>This is not a typical course.  There are no homework problems, mid-terms, exams or even a standard class project. We will work together on a real-world problem to learn, think critically and design alternative solutions for which real-world stakeholders want our input.  As such, marks are accumulated by: a) participating, b) contributing, and c) completing the assignment.  The best marks are earned when contributions are a) creative/comprehensive, b) grounded in sound arguments, both technical and non-technical, and c) effective in terms of communication approach (graphic, oral or written).</p><p>Grading rubrics are provided with assignments because in real life when you write a proposal for a contract or grant, the evaluation metrics or “point” system is usually provided.</p><p>Some assignments may be completed in pairs.  As pairs can be self-selected and change over the term, all deliverables must be uploaded by both people in order for the grade book to be managed.</p><p>Marks are not adjusted or curved in this course.  It is feasible for everyone to get 100% or for everyone to fail – both highly unlikely. It is possible to skip one co-note exercise without penalty (this is why points add to 102 in the class Schedule). </p><p>Late work is in general never accepted out of respect for those who make the due date.  In the event of illness or emergency as defined by Faculty and University policy, extensions may be permitted or deliverables excluded.  Note that the rapid return of marked work and the compilation of individual contributions into joint documents used by the whole class requires a commitment to each other for timely completion of deliverables.</p><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
