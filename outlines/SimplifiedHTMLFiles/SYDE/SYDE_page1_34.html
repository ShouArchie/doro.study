<div>
<div>SYDE 548:</div>
<p>This course approaches the design of tasks, tools, products, and systems from a user-centered design perspective. Emphasis is on the human factors and usability methods, and techniques that can and should be applied throughout the iterative design process. While design issues pertaining to human-computer interaction are discussed, the methods presented can be applied to the design of almost any user interface. Major topics include user research methods for usability and user experience, inspection methods, user testing, applied statistical analysis.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE TO STUDENTS: ALL scheduled class times are to be attended. We use a workshop approach for learning and so there is no distinction between "lecture" and "tutorial" times. </strong></p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SyolzIBNT?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Class%20Attendance&amp;bcGroup=Courses%20and%20Classes&amp;bcItemType=policies">Undergraduate Studies Academic Calendar &gt; Courses and Classes Regulations &gt; Class Attendance</a></p><p>Class Attendance: Students are expected to attend all scheduled components of the courses in which they have enrolled. Students may be required to present documentation confirming the reasons for non-attendance. During the course Add Period, students may be removed from a course for non-attendance. Students who are removed from a class will be notified by the Office of the Registrar.</p><p><strong>About SYDE 548 in practice. </strong></p><p>SYDE 548 (UCD Methods) approaches the design of tasks, tools, products, and systems from a user-centered design perspective. Emphasis is on the human factors and usability methods, and techniques that can and should be applied throughout the iterative design process. While design issues pertaining to human-computer interaction are discussed, the methods presented can be applied to the design of almost any user interface. Major topics include user research methods for usability and user experience, inspection methods, user testing, and applied statistical analysis. </p><p>SYDE 548 User-Centred Design Methods is a technical elective. It builds from earlier SYDE core courses in design (SYDE-BME 161 Introduction to Design, SYDE-BME 162 Human Factors in Design, and SYDE-BME 361 Engineering Design). Motivated students willing to become familiar with basic human factors engineering can participate and contribute to course activities.  Whether you are interested in becoming a UCD specialist, a certified ergonomist, or just want to be a wise designer or consumer, this course will supply you with a range of practical tools (methods). </p><p><strong>Course Pedagogy: Flipped/High Interation. Attendance and participation in-class expected. </strong></p><p>This course runs using a “flipped” format. User Research (UR) and User-Centred Design approaches require interacting with others. Our “In-class” sessions are used as workshops for interactions and hands-on skill development with different UR methods. “Out-of-class” time is used for preliminary work for workshops, learning more about methods through readings, and strengthening skills and honing your user research insights through course deliverables. </p><p><strong>Guiding Principles for SYDE 548. 1) Be compassionate. 2) Be accountable. 3) Be patient. 4) Be safe and healthy. </strong></p>

<p><strong>SYDE 548 Course "Submit in Good Faith" Practice to avoid "0" for late deliverables. </strong>Rather than risking a "0" for a late submission, all students are encouraged to upload whatever they have completed on a deliverable by the specified deadline. This allows the instructor opportunity to take extenuating circumstances into consideration and/or grade "as is" (for part marks rather than 0).  </p><p><strong>Assessments and declaring previous work (individual or team).</strong> Since user-centred design and user research skills are valued by industry, it is important that each student submits original work and demonstrates their own value-added UR skills to earn credit for the course.  All students are expected to work individually and submit their own original work created in the current term for SYDE 548. Under Policy 71, the instructor may have follow-up conversations with individual students to ensure that the work submitted was their original (value-added) work and completed on their own. <strong>Failure to declare collaboration and/or use of unauthorized third-party tools may lead to an academic integrity offence. </strong>See further: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/sites/default/files/uploads/files/final_framework_for_assessment_of_undergrad_unauthorized_collaboration_oct_8_2019_002_0.pdf">UW Policy 71 Framework for Assessment of Unauthorized Collaboration, October 2019</a>. See GenAI &amp; SYDE 548 for how GenAI tools and output will be considered in this course.] </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) may be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.<br/><br/>Screening for unauthorized GenAI use: We will follow University of Waterloo practices and policies, if work submitted is suspected of having been fully or partially created by GenAI without appropriate authorization by the instructor and/or appropriate citations and acknowledgments of GenAI tools used.

When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.

Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
