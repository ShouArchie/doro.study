  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>SYDE 542:</div>

<div>
<p>The intent of this course is to give you hands-on experience with some of the current popular techniques, design and research issues in user interface design. As a result, the course teaches concepts, with examples wherever possible, but the evaluation is focused on the students producing a design portfolio that demonstrates multiple phases of an interface design cycle from requirements gathering, storyboard prototyping, less formal review methods, look and feel prototypes, and finally usability testing. While not explicitly a course in usability testing or human-computer interaction, the course provides some review of these ideas but assumes that the students have experience from prior courses or work experience to use these ideas with minimal review. The emphasis is on learning a systematic design process, advanced knowledge elicitation techniques, and objective evaluation techniques and demonstrating competency in these areas. </p>

<p><strong>Lectures and Tutorials</strong></p><p>This is a fully in-person class. <strong>Attendance is required for both lectures and tutorials</strong>, as lectures will consist of a mix of topic presentation and hands-on exercises, while tutorials will either expand on what was discussed in lecture or provide as feedback sessions for current or previous project milestones. A strong emphasis will be placed on initiative, critical thinking, teamwork, and project management skills. Project feedback will be provided to each team and individually mostly in person (with some summary feedback on each submission). This will be done on a weekly basis, in class and during office hours, so this makes it particularly essential to maintain regular attendance. <strong>Attendance will also be collected weekly during project feedback sessions, which will largely contribute to your participation mark.</strong></p><p>Active participation is expected during all classes. Almost every week there will be time reserved for in-depth discussions, student presentations, development/design activities, design critiques, and studio-based participation and user trials. Attendance and presentation of designs for critique during the practical is expected. <strong>NOTE: </strong>due to the creative nature of the projects, the schedule may require corrections through the term, with graded activities such as in-class presentations scheduled at any time during either the lecture or tutorial. This will contribute to your individual participation mark.<br/><br/>Important instructions and feedback for assignments and term project will also be discussed in class. Students are responsible for being aware of any and all information communicated through lectures and tutorials, as well as online on LEARN.</p><p><strong>Assignment Submissions and Deadlines:</strong> <br/>Assignments will usually be due on the week of class listed in the schedule before Wednesday class begins (2:30 PM EST). Due dates may be subject to change, based on overall class progress – final deadlines for submission will be posted on LEARN. </p><p><strong>Quizzes: </strong><br/>Quizzes will consist of either open-ended questionnaire connecting the team project to the course materials, or “flash” quizzes related to the topic of the lecture. Quizzes will be conducted on LEARN asynchronously, to be completed before class (deadlines to be posted on LEARN). Quizzes will be ongoing throughout the term, and will be posted on LEARN and announced in class when they are posted.</p><p><strong>Late policy:</strong> <br/>All assignment submissions (all "A#" submissions) in the due dates table are eligible for late submission based on a "late credit" scheme. Each team receives a 4-day "no questions asked" credit that can be applied, in 1-day increments, to any of the A# assignments. This is automatically deducted based on the time stamp of the submission. A note that <strong>very late submissions will result in limited feedback</strong> for the assignment, and will potentially hinder the next assignment, as assignments are often due weekly and follow from the previous assignment – so plan to use them wisely. All other submissions are required to be on time, except in documented circumstances as per university policy.</p><p><strong>Teamwork:</strong> <br/>Students are expected to work in teams (of 4-6 students) - this emulates and prepares students for challenges faced in the workplace. This includes working together in person (where safe to do so as per the public health and university rules) or most likely making use of online collaborative tools (e.g. e-mail, Skype, Google Docs, etc.) Teams are required to share workloads equally and fairly – their contributions will be marked both individually and as a team.</p><p>Peer-review forms are used to judge the fairness of teamwork and determine the amount of any teamwork grade deductions that are applied to an individual grade. However, team members are encouraged to approach the instructor confidentially if they believe team members do not cooperate fairly in addition to using the peer review forms. The instructor will take appropriate action, such as individual meetings with team members or group conflict resolution meetings. Peer review forms are to be submitted individually by each team member and are meant to present a student's assessment of the performance and teamwork of their teammates, as well as their own contribution to teamwork. These forms (in addition to other information such as instructors' observations of studio work and team assignments) form the basis of "teamwork grade deductions" which are applied to individual marks. This can add up to 40% of grade, but the instructors may levy additional penalties (up to 80% of the total grade) if individual contribution to teamwork is lacking completely or worse, it is detrimental to a team's progress.</p><p>Your team will be working closely with both the professor and the TAs. This means you will be engaging with both the TA and the instructor during office hours and class time (particularly during studio sessions).</p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
