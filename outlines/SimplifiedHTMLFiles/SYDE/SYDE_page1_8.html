<h4><strong>Problem Sets</strong></h4><p>Roughly each week there will be a problem set posted for you to work on. These are not to be handed in, but will contain similar problems as the assessments. These are meant as the core resource to become competent in the mathematical tools and principles you are studying.</p><h4><strong>Piazza</strong></h4><p>Piazza is a discussion board which can be accessed through LEARN, where you can ask any questions about content in the course. Our class page is <a href="https://piazza.com/class/m4n04rjw79v1hz">here</a>.</p><p>You can post your question publicly so classmates can see, and can post anonymously if you choose.  (Note: you will be anonymous to classmates but not the instructor).  The teaching team will do our best to answer questions in a timely manner.  While it is encouraged for students to discuss course material, you should not post partial or complete answers to the assignments publicly.</p><p>Note that Piazza supports LaTeX syntax for Math. There's also a built-in formula editor that ultimately pastes the LaTeX code. <a href="http://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf">This</a> is a good LaTeX primer.</p><h4><strong>Mobius</strong></h4><p><strong>Mobius</strong> is where additional course content will appear.  You can link to the Mobius SYDE 211 page directly from the main page in LEARN. </p><h4><strong>eTextbook</strong></h4><p>The e-text for Kohler and Johnson is available on LEARN for purchase.  You can have a two week free trial.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4><strong>Generative AI</strong></h4><p>I encourage all students to become familiar with using large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT, as learning aids in this course and beyond. They perform fairly well at lots of the material covered in this course, but not all. Remember that these models regularly produce inaccurate statements and should be treated more similarly to a peer than a teacher. </p><p>The most productive way to learn from these tools is not simply to read their explanations and solutions, but to engage with them: ask follow-up questions, call out mistakes and inconsistencies, generate new examples, recognize common modes of failure, etc. </p><p>Further, the course grade is based entirely upon in-person examinations, in which you will not have access to these tools. You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit on these exams.</p><p> </p><h4><strong>Mental Health</strong></h4><p>Please don't hesitate to make use of the services below if you are feeling overwhelmed or have the slightest inclination that you are in need of some support.</p><p><strong>On-campus Resources:</strong></p><p>Campus Wellness <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</u></a></p><p>Counselling Services: counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca/ 519-888-4567 ext 32655</p><p>MATES: one-to-one peer support program offered by Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) and Counselling Services: mates@uwaterloo.ca</p><p>Health Services: located across the creek from the Student Life Centre, 519-888-4096.</p><p><strong>Off-campus Resources: </strong></p><p>Good2Talk (24/7): Free confidential help line for post-secondary students.

I request that all students work with me to create a class culture based on open communication, mutual respect, and inclusion. As a class we will approach all discussions with respect and civility. Disagreements and debates in academic discourse are expected and welcome, but personal attacks are never OK, and will not be tolerated. I strive to ensure an open and welcoming classroom for all students. If I ever miss the mark, please don’t hesitate to contact me. We are all learning together.</p><p><strong>Caregiver Responsibilities Policy: </strong>I have great respect for students who are balancing their pursuit of education with the responsibilities of caring for children or other family members. If you run into challenges or if your caregiving responsibilities are interfering with your ability to engage in this course, please contact me.</p><p><strong>School-Life Conflict: </strong>Many students face obstacles to their education as a result of work or family obligations or unforeseen personal difficulties. If you are experiencing challenges throughout the term that are impacting your ability to succeed in this course, or in your undergraduate career more broadly, please reach out to me so that we can work together to form a plan for your academic success. </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous"><u>Office of Indigenous Relations</u></a><u>.</u> </p><p><strong>Inclusive Teaching</strong>-<strong>Learning Spaces</strong>: The University of Waterloo values the diverse and intersectional identities of its students, faculty, and staff. The University regards equity and diversity as an integral part of academic excellence and is committed to accessibility for all. We consider our classrooms, online learning, and community spaces to be places where we all will be treated with respect, dignity, and consideration. We welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability – and other visible and nonvisible differences. We are all expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive teaching- learning environment. Any member of the campus community who has experienced discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/"><u>Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R)</u></a> via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a>. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/sexual-violence-prevention-response-office"><u>Sexual Violence Prevention &amp; Response Office (SVPRO)</u></a>, supports students at UWaterloo who have experienced, or have been impacted by, sexual violence and gender-based violence. This includes those who experienced harm, those who are supporting others who experienced harm. SVPRO can be contacted at <a href="mailto:svpro@uwaterloo.ca"><u>svpro@uwaterloo.ca</u></a></p><p><strong>Religious &amp; Spiritual Observances: </strong>The University of Waterloo has a duty to accommodate religious and spiritual observances under the Ontario Human Rights Code. Please inform the instructor at the beginning of term if special accommodation needs to be made for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and assignments. Consult with your instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought. </p><p><strong>Respectful Communication and Pronouns: </strong>Communications with Instructor(s) and teaching assistants (TAs) should be through recommended channels for the course (e.g., email, LEARN, Piazza, Teams, etc.) Please use your UWaterloo email address. Include an academic signature with your full name, program, student ID. We encourage you to include your pronouns to facilitate respectful communication (e.g., he/him; she/her; they/them). You can update your chosen/preferred name at <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u>.</a> You can update your pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information"><u>Quest</u></a>. </p><p><strong>Mental Health and Wellbeing Resources: </strong>If you are facing challenges impacting one or more courses, contact your academic advisor, Associate Chair Undergraduate, or the Director of your academic program. Mental health is a serious issue for everyone and can affect your ability to do your best work. We encourage you to seek out mental health and wellbeing support when needed. The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering-wellness-program/"><u>Faculty of Engineering Wellness</u></a> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering-wellness-program/"><u>Program</u></a> has programming and resources for undergraduate students.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
