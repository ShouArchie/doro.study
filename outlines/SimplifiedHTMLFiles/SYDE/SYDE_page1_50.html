<div>
<div>
<div>NANO 605 / SYDE 683:</div>
<p>Rigorous grounding in the theory and practice of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) design, as well as ways of extending them to Nano-Electro-Mechanical Systems (NEMS) design. Analytical tools to explore the possibilities of NEMS. Includes methodology to derive and use MEMS and NEMS models as design tools, basic concepts of statics and dynamics needed to construct lumped-mass models, the use of reduced-order models in MEMS/NEMS design, advantages and disadvantages of these techniques versus commercial software (COMSOL, ANSYS, and Coventor), most effective uses and limitations for each modeling approach.</p>

<p>Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology has drastically reduced the size and cost of sensors and actuators while improving their performance. It is now the technology of choice for novel sensors and actuators. Its footprint is expanding in the display, communi- cations, and haptics industries. Meanwhile, Nano-Electro-Mechanical Systems (NEMS) are coming to their own as the next stage in the sensor miniaturization process. The trouble is: it is quite hard to design and fabricate reliable MEMS or NEMS. This course aims to help address this challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Course Project:</strong></p><p>We will start the project in the fourth week by introducing the proposed device. Each of you will select a modeling &amp; simulation technique to perform a set of three tasks, namely static, eigenvalue, and dynamic analyses of the device. Henceforth, you will report back on your progress and compare your results in class. The tasks will buildup incrementally to allow you, during the last two weeks of the term, to write a group report composed of:</p><p>1)  Introduction: A short literature review on the state-of-the-art in modeling, simulation, and recent results relevant to your device.</p><p>2)  Problem Statement: A concise description of the device, its design, and your analytical tasks.</p><p>3)  Results: A detailed description of your model and the results you obtained.</p><p>4)  Discussion: a) Interpretation of your results: what do the numbers mean / tell us about the device? b) Comparison of the similarities and differences among your results and</p><p>with those available in the literature.</p><p>5)  Conclusions: Which modeling &amp; simulation techniques work best for what types of</p><p>analytical tasks? What is the value proposition for each modeling technique? What are your conclusions about this design of the device? What are your recommendations for a second generation design?</p><p><strong>Intellectual Property: </strong>Be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.
