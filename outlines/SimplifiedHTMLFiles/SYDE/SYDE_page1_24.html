<p><strong>Estimated Weekly Course Commitment: </strong></p><ul><li>5 hours of content/lectures/activities</li><li>5 hours of project work</li><li>120 hours/person/term is expected over the course of the project</li></ul><p>The Faculty of Engineering expects students to spend 8-10 hours per week on a course (e.g. 3 hours lectures, 7-9 hours on course preparation, assignments, etc.). </p><p>In SYDE 362, the main learning vehicles are team-based design projects. Class members must make a minimum commitment of 5-7 hours per week for the design projects. It is highly recommended that teams meet to work on the project for at least 1 hour a week to discuss their project status, and also use the class times to meet or independently work on the project.</p><p><strong>Policies on Required Coursework:</strong></p><p>Late or Missed Course Deliverables and Milestones:</p><ul><li>A late penalty of -10% per day late (24h) will be applied to any assignments.</li><li>No extensions will be given after a submission date. Extensions will only be given for very serious issues, and will only be considered for the following circumstances:<ul><li>Domestic tragedy (notify Victoria as soon as possible of the situation)</li><li>Extreme illness (Verification of Illness Form from UWaterloo Health Services must be provided within 48hrs; if still ill, you may scan and email or have a friend deliver it to SYDE Undergrad Coordinator and notify Victoria ASAP) or follow UW Illness Policy.</li><li>Known conflict: Victoria must be notified before the assignment deadline, as earlier as possible. Proof of conflict is required.</li></ul></li><li>Participation marks will be awarded based on both attendance and active participation in lab activities. Participation marks are awarded according to the discretion of the TA. If a student is more than 30 minutes late to the lab, their participation mark for that lab may be withheld.</li></ul><p><strong>Marking of Team-Based Deliverables: </strong></p><p>By default, marks for all team-based deliverables will be applied to all group members. However, the instructor reserves the right to assign individual students a fraction of the total group mark on any specific team-based deliverable without sufficient evidence of that student’s contribution to the group effort. The onus is on each individual student to provide evidence of their individual contribution to the team effort.</p><p>If a team feels that lack of effort by one or more group members is negatively impacting the group’s ability to meet the progress or outcome expectations for the course, the situation MUST be identified to the course instructor PRIOR to any impacted deliverable to be considered for accommodation in deliverable grading. Otherwise, default grading criteria will be applied (e.g., project progress and outcomes will be assessed on the basis of a full team effort). Group members must submit a written request for accommodation, PRIOR to the deliverable deadline, detailing the situation. Note that submission of an accommodation request is not in and of itself approval. </p><p>It is the responsibility of ALL team members to ensure the accuracy and quality of all aspects of submitted team-based deliverables. Therefore, any academic integrity offenses arising from a team-based deliverable will impact ALL group members.</p><p><strong>Email Policy:</strong></p><p>All course emails should follow the following guidelines:</p><ul><li>All emails should be sent using your official UW email account.</li><li>Include SYDE 362 in the subject of your email.</li><li>Address your email appropriately and be professional.</li><li>Sign your email with your first and last name. If you use a name different than your name as shown on QUEST, please include both.</li><li>Allow 24-48 hours for a response to your email.</li></ul><p>Email should be used for brief questions that can be answered quickly. Please make an appointment to see Victoria, or talk to her before/after scheduled classes, for detailed discussions/explanations.</p><p><strong>Use of Laptops / Personal Computing Devices during Class:</strong></p><p>Use of laptops, tablets, and other personal computing devices during class will be at the instructor’s discretion. The devices can be highly distracting to both the student using the device and other students in the class. Use of these devices must be restricted to course-related activities (e.g. viewing course materials, doing lab activities, etc.) at appropriate times. Distractions resulting from the use of these devices may result in a student being asked to leave the classroom. At times during the course you will be asked to put away your electronic devices.<br/><br/><strong>Academic Integrity Policy:</strong></p><p>It is expected that within this course, the highest standards of academic integrity will be maintained, in keeping with UW’s Policy 71, “Student Academic Discipline Policy.” While all aspects of Policy 71 apply to all UW courses, of particular relevance to SYDE 362, it is each student’s responsibility to avoid:</p><ul><li>plagiarism, “which is the act of presenting the ideas, words or other intellectual property of another as one's own…properly acknowledged use of sources is an accepted and important part of scholarship” (UW Policy 71).</li><li>misrepresentation, “lying, submitting or presenting false research...This includes, but is not limited to, actions such as: concocting research or lab results; misrepresenting the date or time of submission” (UW Policy 71).</li></ul><p><strong>In SYDE 362:</strong></p><p>Sanctioned Collaboration vs. Individual Work</p><ul><li>Collaboration is allowed for in-class exercises and the team components of the design projects.</li><li>Individual components of the design projects (e.g. lab books) must be an individual effort.</li><li>Design project instructions will identify individual and team components</li></ul><p><strong>Writing and Communication Centre</strong><br/>The Writing and Communication Centre (WCC) works with students as they develop their ideas, draft, and revise. Writing and communication specialists offer one-on-one support in planning assignments, synthesizing and citing research, organizing papers and reports, designing presentations and e-portfolios, and revising for clarity and coherence. </p><p>You can make multiple appointments throughout the term or drop in at the Library for quick questions or feedback. To book a 50-minute appointment and to see drop-in hours, visit <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/wcc"><u>www.uwaterloo.ca/wcc</u></a>. Group appointments for team-based projects, presentations, and papers are also available.</p><p>Please note that communication specialists guide you to see your work as readers would. They can teach you revising skills and strategies, but will not change or correct your work for you.</p><p><strong>Note: Any regrade requests (if you believe there was an error in your grading) for assignments or tests must be requested within one week of the deliverable mark becoming available. Regrade requests after this period of time will not be investigated. </strong></p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that the use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See the Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility, and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus support if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p><strong>Faculty of Engineering Guiding Practices. </strong></p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
