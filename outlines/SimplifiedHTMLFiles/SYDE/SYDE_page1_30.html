  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>SYDE 535:</div>
<p>This course will introduce and apply the fundamentals of computational simulation for complex systems. Data collection and analysis, conceptual modelling, computational modelling, output analysis, and communication of results to non-expert audiences will be covered extensively. Students will develop computational simulations to explore potential solutions for complex societal problems, identifying emergent scenarios, costs, and benefits with the goal of informing decision-makers.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>The course is designed around a class project. Students will choose the societal and environmental system they want to tackle in their projects. </p><p>Experience with Python coding is not required, but assignments and class projects will require coding. In-class tutorials will help students develop their coding skills.  </p>

<h4>Deliverables:</h4><p> Homework will be done individually or in groups of up to 2 students. Project-related deliverables will require groups of 3-4 students. Larger groups will only be considered if all project groups have at least 3 members. Evaluations (i.e., homework and project deliverables) will cover materials taught in all lectures. Students are responsible for reviewing materials from lectures they miss. </p><h4>Assignment deadlines:</h4><p>Homework assignments and project deliverables deadlines are on Fridays at 11:59 p.m.</p><h4>Assignment Submission Procedures:</h4><p>Assignments will be posted on LEARN 2 weeks before the due date. Due dates are listed in the Tentative Course Schedule. <u>Slight variations may occur and will be announced ahead of time</u>.</p><h4>Class project:</h4><p>The Class Project will be announced and discussed in class at the start of the term. The project is split into 5 deliverables: a pitch, two milestones, a presentation, and a final report. The pitch and milestones will prepare the team for their final project application. The project pitch will allow the instructor to provide early feedback on the intended topic. Students will receive in-class instructions on how to prepare each deliverable. The presentation may include invited guests (e.g., UW faculty, students, and external members of the community).</p><p>Class projects include a presentation anticipated to happen on Week 12. <u>The other team members are responsible for the presentation if a group member is unavailable</u>. All team members will receive the same marks for their presentation. </p><p>The groups will decide the topic of the class project. Some of the topics selected by students in previous years include:</p><ul><li>Optimal monetary incentives for EV transition in Canada</li><li>Study of monetary and educational policies on earthquake retrofits in Vancouver, BC</li><li>Evaluation of optimal housing subsidies for UW income students</li><li>Sustainable farming practices in California considering climate change impacts on water availability</li><li>Assessment of micro-mobility alternatives for Vancouver, BC</li><li>Optimal location for windfarms in Newfound Land and Labrador</li><li>Sustainable practices for salmon fish farming in BC</li><li>Management of algae blooms in Toledo, Ohio</li></ul><h4>Late Submission Rules:</h4><p><strong>Homework</strong>: A grace period of 2 days is allowed <u>per group,</u> where students can submit the assignment late without penalty. The 2 days can be used for one or split between 2 assignments. A fraction of the day, i.e., hour(s) after the submission deadline, counts as a day. Once grace days are used up, a 10% per day penalty will be applied. If students switch groups for different homework, the minimum number of remaining grace days will be assigned to the group.</p><p><strong>Project deliverables</strong>: groups are responsible for submitting deliverables on time, <u>irrespective of individual circumstances</u>. A penalty of 10% per day will be applied for late submissions.</p>

In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights and academic integrity.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.</p><p><strong>Continuity Plan - Fair Contingencies for Unforeseen Circumstances (e.g., resurgence of COVID-19): </strong>In the event of emergencies or highly unusual circumstances, the instructor will collaborate with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty. This may include modifying content delivery, course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines with due and fair notice to students. Substantial changes after the first week of classes require the approval of the Associate Dean, Undergraduate Studies.</p><p><strong>Declaring absences:</strong> [<i>undergraduate students and/or courses only</i>]  Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, students are responsible for reaching out to their instructors as soon as possible. The course instructor will determine how missed course components are accommodated.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
