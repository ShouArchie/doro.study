<p>Simulations and virtual environments are excellent tools to conduct controlled, experimental studies aimed at understanding safety, and which in turn can influence optimal infrastructural enhancements, redesign of devices and even impact policy decisions, either directly or indirectly. In this course, the functional relationships between the various elements of driving simulation such as the simulation computer processing, the validity and fidelity of simulators are examined and the factors influencing simulation design and measurement are covered. The design of simulator-based experiments is explored broadly, inclusive of data mining, data analyses techniques and mixed research methodologies. The course wraps up with a discussion of advances in simulation, touching upon augmented reality and mixed reality.</p><p>This syllabus is ambitious.  Given time constraints, some topics may be omitted.</p>

<p><strong><u>ASSIGNMENTS</u></strong></p><p>Four assignments will be assigned over the term, each of 5 percent weightage. </p><p>Assignments will be available on – Jan 13; Jan 27; Feb 10; Feb 24, 2025.</p><p>Assignments will be due on – Jan 27; Feb 10; Feb 24; Mar 10, 2025.</p><p><strong><u>CASE STUDY</u></strong></p><p>All students must present a case study seminar individually. </p><ul><li>The requirement is to identify a relatively underexplored real-world road safety problem.</li><li>Conduct a detailed literature review that clearly demonstrates the existence of the problem, and identifies the key Human Factors that mediate the problem.</li><li>Explore existing solutions (via literature review, expert interviews, or textual analysis or any other method) that can address the identified problem.</li><li>Critically analyze the shortcomings/strengths with potential solutions.</li><li>Clearly detail the challenges associated with the problem space.</li><li>Produce a one-page infographic that can be used to educate the common man (average road user) on the various ways in which they might mitigate a perilous safety issue.</li></ul><p><strong><u>TERM PROJECT</u></strong></p><p>Ideation report - 10%</p><p>Experiment design document - 17.5%</p><p>Simulation demo - 12.5%</p><p>Final Report - 20%</p><p>The course will involve one term project expected to be completed in phases over the semester. The topical area is surface transportation human factors. More specifically, students will discuss with the instructor and identify a theoretical behavioral topic with an experimental basis. Students will be expected to define objectives, identify a priori hypothesis, design an experiment involving human subject testing, collect data from participants, analyze the data using appropriate techniques, interpret findings and arrive at conclusions. In its entirety, the project will use lessons learnt in class and teach the student a complete life cycle of experimental, behavioral research. The project (and its components) will comprise 60 percent of the total course grade.</p><p>There will be <strong>2</strong> short double-spaced interim reports expected, one at the Ideation phase (3 pager) and a second at the Experimental Design phase (5 pages). A simulation demo is scheduled for Mar 21 where groups must present their simulation scenarios and tasks.</p><p>The Term Project will culminate with a Final Report due at the end of the semester. The Final Term Report should be written up in a Scientific Paper format using appropriate Referencing (APA style). The goal (and hope) will be to obtain a scientifically publishable paper from the Term Project effort. Final report must be no more than 10 pages single-space formatted as per the guidelines of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting. </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

SVPRO can be contacted at <a href="mailto:svpro@uwaterloo.ca"><u>svpro@uwaterloo.ca</u></a></p><p><strong>Religious &amp; Spiritual Observances: </strong>The University of Waterloo has a duty to accommodate religious and spiritual observances under the Ontario Human Rights Code. Please inform the instructor at the beginning of term if special accommodation needs to be made for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and assignments. Consult with your instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought. </p><p><strong>Respectful Communication and Pronouns: </strong>Communications with Instructor(s) and teaching assistants (TAs) should be through recommended channels for the course (e.g., email, LEARN, Piazza, Teams, etc.) Please use your UWaterloo email address. Include an academic signature with your full name, program, student ID. We encourage you to include your pronouns to facilitate respectful communication (e.g., he/him; she/her; they/them).

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
