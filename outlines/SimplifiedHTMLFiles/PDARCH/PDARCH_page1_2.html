  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>PDARCH 3:</div>
<p>This course will elaborate upon digital skills introduced in PDARCH2. Students will learn the fundamentals of web design and will create a living, interactive, digital portfolio. Students will learn how to structure, design, and manage websites and web logs.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>PDArch3 builds upon the skills and principles developed in PDArch2. Students will be introduced to the core elements of a successful website from an identity and storytelling standpoint, and explore the craft of working with structure, layout, typography, and colour to bring a compelling and professional website to life. This will provide a foundation for both the critical evaluation and design of a custom online portfolio. By the end of the course, each student will have created a fully-functioning website to serve as a counterpart to or replacement of their print/digital PDF portfolio.</p><p>Just like any successful print publication, or any design project, a successful website must be approached with a holistic vision which runs through every aspect of its design.  Given that this is the presentation of a personal portfolio, this requires the establishment of a clear notion of your identity - a primary focus of the course.  What do you stand for?  What sets you apart as a designer and thinker?  Such questions should form the basis for establishing a core concept which guides the design of the site.  Taking this further, how can you put the elements of graphic design to use to communicate these ideas?  The website is a design item, the purpose of which is to augment and strengthen the reading of your work and give an overall sense of who you are.  A premium will be placed on individual creativity and excellence of craft.</p><p>This course assumes no prior knowledge of, or experience with, web development or coding.  Rather, it is designed first and foremost to teach the critical concepts of web design from a craft and theory standpoint.  Because the course is designed for architects and not web designers, there are no specific requirements set out in terms of the means by which the website is crafted. While you are welcome to code your own site from scratch if so inclined, you are also free to work from a webhost service such as Squarespace, Wix, WordPress, Adobe Dreamweaver, Cargo Collective, etc.</p>
