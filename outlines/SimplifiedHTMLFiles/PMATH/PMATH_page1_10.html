<p><strong><u>Grading Schemes:</u></strong></p><p><strong>Grading Scheme 2 is only available as an option for you if you take all three quizzes and score above 75% in each quiz.</strong></p><p>If you qualify for Scheme 2, you may still choose to sit the final exam and use Scheme 1 as your grading scheme. However, if you choose to sit the final, then you do not have an option to use Scheme 2 (<i>even if Scheme 2 ends up giving you a higher mark</i>).</p><p><strong><u>Assignments:</u></strong></p><p><strong>You may complete each assignment in a group of up to three people. Your groups must be declared before submitting each assignment. You do not have to stay with the same group from assignment to assignment, and you may choose to complete an assignment alone. </strong>(See LEARN and attend the lectures for instructions on how to do this).</p><p>Each Assignment will be worth 10% and is to be submitted through Crowdmark by 6:00pm on the due date (which is always a Friday). The due dates for the assignments are:</p><p>A1 - 24th Jan<br/>A2 - 7th Feb<br/>A3 - 28th Feb<br/>A4 - 14th Mar<br/>A5 - 28th Mar</p><p><strong><u>Quizzes:</u></strong></p><p>The Quizzes will be worth 5% each. They will be 45 minutes long and take place during the lecture time on the following dates (always Friday):</p><p>Q1 - 31st Jan<br/>Q2 - 7th Mar<br/>Q3 - 4th Apr</p><p>There will be no midterms! Hooray!</p><p><strong><u>Final:</u></strong></p><p>The final exam (for those who take the exam, see the "Grading Schemes" section above), will be scheduled during exam period.</p><p><strong><u>Missed Assessments and Late Submission Policy:</u></strong></p><p>In case of a missed assessment, you should notify your instructor via email within 24 hours of the assessment's completion/due date in order to receive an accommodation. To be eligible for an accommodation, you must either use the self-declaration form on Quest or, if the assessment was missed due to illness, you must submit a Verification of Illness form (https://uwaterloo.ca/math/vif-submission). <strong>If you do not send an email informing the instructor of your absence, your grade will be automatically recorded as zero.</strong> Properly documented absences will result in the following accommodations:</p><ul><li>Quizzes: The weight will be shifted to the other Quizzes.</li><li>Assignments: A 24-48 hour extension will be provided, as appropriate.</li></ul><p>If you miss a quiz you will not be eligible for grading scheme 2 (even if an accommodation is provided). </p>

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
