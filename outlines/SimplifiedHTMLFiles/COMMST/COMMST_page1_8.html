<div>COMMST 111:</div>
<p>This course focuses on developing the qualities and transferable skills necessary for integration, continuous learning, and professional development.

<p><strong>COURSE DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>COMMST 111 is a course in effective public, interpersonal, and group communication, designed to develop communication awareness in four key areas: the relationship between self and others; the relationship between purpose and responsibility; the context of communication; and interpersonal power.  Each of these areas will be explored while pursuing the Communication Studies program's primary objectives.  This course will:</p><ul><li> examine agency and implication;</li><li> support critical and creative competencies; </li><li>encourage a language and imagination for the public good; as well as</li><li>recognize diverse linguistic practices and modes of expression as resources for writers and speakers.</li></ul><p>You will develop knowledge and embody skills in these four areas through exploration of communication theory, preparing and presenting individual and team presentations, exploring team dynamics as you work towards a team presentation, and giving feedback.<strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>COURSE PURPOSE</strong></p><p>To succeed as a professional, you need what are typically termed “human skills” or “people skills” because those determine whether your technical knowledge can be successfully applied to deliver results. Over many of your degree-required courses, you will be put into situations where you will develop and demonstrate these “people skills.”  COMMST 111 is designed to build a strong foundation of communication and collaboration capabilities which are two of the people skills important to your academic, co-op, and professional success.</p>

<div>
<p><u>Team Contract (5%)</u></p><p>Early in the course, you will choose, or be assigned, a group of 5 people to work with on some projects through the term. I expect that you will be in contact with your group early in order to set up expectations for communication through the term, and to negotiate how you will approach your shared assignments.  In order to facilitate your expectations for communication with each other, you will create a contract as a team, outlining what you have agreed upon in your group. The contract will be due in the third week of class and is a pass/fail assignment. If you complete it according to assignment expectations you will earn 5/5; if you fail to hand it in or fail to meet expectations, you will earn 0/5.</p><p><u>Response Assignments: (3 at 10% each for a total of 30%)</u></p><p>On assigned days you will submit a roughly two-page response assignment that connects the course readings to your own experience; these may be due outside of class or be completed in class according to instructor preference.  Each response will involve <i>at least two direct quotations</i> from a required course reading and will involve connecting a major concept in that reading to your assignments, your teamwork, or your general experience. Students will be provided with a new topic for each assignment. The topics are mentioned in the assignment outline. Students are required to write 3 individual responses worth 10% each.</p><p><u>Individual Persuasive Presentation (20%)</u></p><p>You will <i>individually</i> design and present one five-minute, prepared, persuasive presentation to be presented in class. The subject matter is up to you but you are encouraged to talk to your instructor about your proposition. </p><p>Notes on Presentations:</p><ul><li>You must electronically submit one outline and one cue card for your formal presentation.<strong> </strong></li><li>You may lose up to one full letter grade on your presentation if it is under 4:00 or over 6:00. You may lose up to 10% of your final grade on a presentation if you fail to submit an outline and/or cue card<i>. </i></li><li>Do not collaborate with other students on your presentation design or plagiarize your topics or sources.</li><li>All presentation content in all rounds must be original, including humorous material and pop culture references.</li></ul><p><u>Team Presentation Interpersonal (10%)</u></p><p>Within your assigned teams, you will design and present one prepared, ten- minute presentation teaching the class one of the key concepts from the readings assigned on the day you present, and you will plan for another ten-minute question-and-answer period. You will be expected to do research outside of the reading and your team will help to clarify the concept with this research and engage the class in an activity or discussion that helps them to understand the concept. Two teams will present in each class during this round of presentations, and the presentations will take place at the beginning of the class.</p><p><u>Team Case Study Presentation  (20%)</u></p><p>Within your assigned teams of five, you will design and present one prepared, twenty-minute presentation, offering a solution to the financial challenges presented in the case study.  The presentations will be held in class on the dates assigned and will be graded in collaboration between your COMMST 111 instructor and a TA from SAF.</p><p><u>Peer Feedback for Case Study (5% Individual)</u></p><p>You will arrange for everyone in your team to each give written feedback to one member of the team. The feedback assignments will focus on the experience of working with your team member, drawing on the interpersonal/team relationships. Each feedback assignment will include five feedback messages, three positive and three constructive. You will be required to make your feedback available to your team member and to be available for any questions your team member has about the feedback. </p><p><u>Participation (10% Individual)</u></p><p>Because this course is a workshop course, and because you develop skills that you will employ in your professional life, 10% of your final grade depends on your in-class participation and your professional attitude and performance.  You can earn credit easily and consistently by contributing thoughtfully on a regular basis.  Consistent contribution is important, but quality of contribution is significant as well; you will not earn an outstanding participation grade by dominating discussion.</p><p> </p><p>Attendance grades will contribute significantly to your participation grade. Please note that attendance is mandatory; see course policies for penalties regarding absence and lateness without legitimate reason.</p><p><strong>Lateness</strong>: After your first lateness, each late arrival to class will result in a 0.5% penalty to your participation grade.</p><p><strong>Absence</strong>: Without documentation and/or self-declaration of absence in Quest, after your first absence, every time you are absent from class, you will receive a 1% penalty to your participation grade.</p><p><strong>Submission of Assignments</strong>: All assignments must be submitted on the date indicated on the syllabus or by your instructor, with extensions given in extenuating circumstances and after consultation with your instructor. Late submissions without contact will receive a 2% mark down for each day late, including weekends. All assignments should be word processed and, unless otherwise specified, double-spaced and free from spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors. I will not accept emailed assignments unless previous arrangements have been made.</p><p><strong>Grading of Shared Assignments</strong>: Group assignments are designed to build teamwork skills and to allow groups to share decision-making and workloads; shared grades reflect this.  Your instructor has the right to give a reduced grade, or to give no grade, to any student who does not participate equitably or at all in shared assignments. </p><p>In the case group challenges to shared grades, your instructor will require you each submit a checklist of what you have contributed and your individual grades will be assessed from there.</p><p><strong>Research and Documentation</strong>: All submissions involving research will be in accordance with MLA format. </p><p><strong>Course Materials: </strong>All required readings and materials for this course will be made available to you through e-reserve. </p><p><strong>A word on email and office hours**:</strong> Office hours will be held online or in-person at the discretion of your instructor; you may also email your instructor with questions. Please be aware that your instructor may not answer email on weekends, evenings, or holidays, so plan accordingly. </p><p>**<strong>When sending an email</strong>, please include a subject line, your student number, name, the class you’re in, and a detailed explanation of your inquiry. </p><p><strong>Discussion Guidelines:</strong> Readings, themes, and discussions in this class may challenge your attitudes, your unconsciously held beliefs, or your positions on current issues. This may feel uncomfortable at times, but discomfort can be an important part of learning. In order to ensure a safe and open space for all students to converse and learn productively, it is vital that we conduct our discussions with professionalism and respect. What this looks like is: </p><ul><li>Listening without interruption</li><li>Paying attention and responding to what is said</li><li>Using inclusive language, from addressing others according to their wishes, to avoiding harmful language, including statements that attack or demean another’s race, sex, gender identity, religion, social class, disability, physical characteristics, and personal attacks in general. Changing your language if a problem is pointed out.</li><li>Focusing on the points/arguments being made and avoiding personal attacks (ie, the point/ argument has shortcomings, rather than the person)</li><li>Supporting claims with reasoning, evidence, and relevant examples</li><li>Respecting instructor moderation: If you are asked to change your language, stop or reconsider a line of argumentation, or otherwise modify your conduct in consideration of others, you do so. We are all learning and it’s normal to mess up. If disrespectful conduct persists after being asked to change your behavior, you may face disciplinary action.</li></ul><p><strong>A note on grades:</strong> The points below address how marking works in the Faculty of Arts:</p><ul><li>Instructors in Communication Studies will not start with a score of 100 and deduct points from that 100. Rather, instructors will evaluate your work to see how it meets the expectations for that assignment as outlined in the syllabus.</li><li>C work (62 and above) is work that demonstrates moderate attention to assignment expectations</li><li>In Communication Studies courses, your work will be evaluated in several areas including presentation quality (writing, speaking, etc.), critical thinking, depth, organization, cohesiveness (how well your work hangs together), creativity, understanding of concepts, etc. Assignments may be strong in one of these areas, and weak in other areas. A’s are awarded when work is exceptional in every area.</li><li>As indicated in the UW undergraduate calendar, the following is the UW grading system: 95, A+; 89, A; 83, A-; 78, B+; 75, B; 72, B-; 68, C+; 65, C; 62, C-; 58, D+; 55, D; 52, D-; 38, F.</li><li>The below offers an explanation of marks in Communication Studies</li></ul><p>o  A, assignment is exceptional in all areas noted above and in all areas specified in the syllabus</p><p>o  B, assignment competently addresses all areas noted above and all areas specified in the syllabus, and a few sections may be exceptional</p><p>o  C, assignment moderately addresses all areas noted above and all areas specified in the syllabus</p><p>o  D, assignment offers less than moderate attention to all areas noted above and all areas specified in the syllabus</p><ul><li>F, assignment generally fails to offer any attention to areas noted above and areas specified in the syllabus</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as developing persuasive techniques, writing responses to the ideas of others, and reflecting on your experiences. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience.

Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details.

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
