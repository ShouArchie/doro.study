<p>In this course, you will work to enhance your written and oral technical communication competencies in contexts relevant to the engineering profession as well as to your future career. Through participation during class and completion of course assignments, you will gain practice in genres of communication crafted for audiences that might include employers, clients, peer groups, technical staff, public audiences, and regulatory and policy-focused stakeholders. A focus on genre, design, and audience will help you to prioritize concepts such as meaning-making, perception, and (social) responsibility in both written and oral classroom proceedings and assignments to develop confidence whether a reader, writer, listener or presenter.</p><p>More generally, in this course, you should anticipate learning what professional norms of technical communication and dominant forms of sharing knowledge prevail within and across the fields of engineering. Yet this course also attempts to impart awareness and appreciation for how these communicative forms are matters of social context and sites of negotiation and contestation. This course is designed to lead you toward the insight that communication has the power to shape knowledge; and that communication does not merely transmit information. Therefore, I expect that you will not only gain practical experience in discursive conventions, but will also be able to reflect upon the formative power of those conventions. Effective communication is rarely a matter of plugging in formulas — instead, you will have an opportunity to learn to write and speak through negotiation of meaning(s). One of my hopes as you proceed through this course is that you will begin to recognize knowledge claims and meaning as negotiated, constructed, and contested. By extension, this progression also encourages you to find a place and voice in the conversations within your fields of study and to reflect upon the meaning and shape of available forums for technical communication. [Easter Egg 1: Successfully use the word serendipity when speaking during our first class.] From the perspective of this class,  technical  communicators  act  as  epistemic  brokers,  facilitating  knowledge production processes and articulating claims to both public and peer audiences. To act in this way, technical communicators need to know how persuasion works.</p><p>How I Lead This Course</p><p>I lead this course as a workshop and expect you to attend all classes and to participate actively. You should expect to complete weekly reading, reviewing classroom material/discussion, and/or completing activities in addition to what we will do during class. You will need to budget extra time in some weeks to work upon assignments and projects. Planning ahead is strongly encouraged.</p><p>This course may require more reading (and analysis toward understanding) than you have previously experienced. The primary reference text is <i>Writing in the Technical Fields: A Practical Guide </i>(Third Edition)<i> </i>by Thorsten Ewald (Oxford University Press), and is available in a print or electronic edition; either version is fine. The text will be supplemented where appropriate with videos, podcasts, and shorter online artifacts. These will be uploaded or linked to on LEARN or through the library Course Reserves.</p><p>Despite the above note, engagement and success in the course will follow from the effort you put into reading carefully, critically, and analytically. If you have not contributed recently to in-person proceedings, you should expect me to be interested in what you have to say and to call upon you by name for your input. In short, prepare for and strive to engage while attending class.</p><p>I perceive our classroom as a co-constructed space, in which readings and discussions may frequently challenge your attitudes, your unconsciously held beliefs, or your positions on current issues. This may sometimes result in your feeling uncomfortable … but never unsafe. To ensure a safe and open space in which all can converse and learn productively, it is vital that we conduct our relationships with respect and an ethic of care. </p>

<h4><strong>Objectives for Students of Communication Studies</strong></h4><p> </p><ol><li>You (students) will understand the complexity of communication as a human process of shared meaning-making in the context of power, history, and culture. </li><li>You will increase your capacity to recognize and enhance yours and others’ agency – the ability to make a difference in the world for yourself and others – and understand the implications of your communication behaviors for yourself and others.</li><li>Recognize diverse linguistic practices and modes of communication as resources for writers and speakers.</li><li>You will understand communication as a practice, and improve your critical and creative communication competencies by developing your ability to use writing, speaking, and other media of communication to create effective and engaging artifacts.</li><li>You will practice responsiveness to different audiences and express yourselves intentionally to specific audiences. This means treating audiences not as passive recipients but as active collaborators in shaping communication, and entails anticipating, reflecting, modeling, researching, and consulting with communities, publics, and individuals.</li><li>You will cultivate your curiosity, openness, and willingness to take on challenges. This entails opportunities for students-directed inquiry, challenge and risk-taking, and reflection on your roles and responsibilities. </li><li>Your will reflect on your role in fostering the public good (the multifaceted well-being of individuals and groups), begin to imagine a better future, and make decisions in your communication that can transform the communities to which you belong.</li></ol><p> </p>

Attendance alone is not sufficient, but attendance can go a long way toward demonstrating engagement and contributions to the course. In other words: if you're not present, you can't engage.</p><p>Some people are more demonstrative than others. Talking all the time is not engagement, especially if it demonstrates unpreparedness and detracts from other students' experiences. As mentioned elsewhere on the syllabus, it is essential we conduct our engagement with each other with professionalism appropriate to the environment and respect in accordance with our level of familiarity.</p><p>At the end of the term you will have a chance to make the case for what grade you believe you should receive with a self-assessment. As we proceed in the course you should ask yourself some of the following questions if you're wondering if you're on track:</p><p>Regarding my activity in this class:</p><ul><li>Was my work complete? Did I contribute something for each of the activities (if any) listed for that week?</li><li>Was I on time? Was I disruptive to class? Did I make my contributions available to my peers in a timely manner that they can respond and engage with it?</li><li>Was I engaged? Did my contributions show that I was properly prepared, that I have read/watched/listened to the assigned material, and am thinking about it?</li><li>Was I collaborative? If relevant, am I responding to others in an informed or curious way, and am I doing so in a generous, thoughtful way?</li></ul></td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Weekly Quizzes</td><td> </td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Pitch Proposal </td><td><p>In this assignment, you will choose a specific topic related to civil engineering and identify an overarching problem to produce a project proposal.</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><p>In this assignment you will creating a proposal in response to an imagined request for proposals (RFP) from a contractor in the industry, and presenting that proposal in a short three-minute pitch for your classmates, who will consider the persuasiveness of your proposal.</p><p>When considering the audience, imagine a group of organizational leaders in the industry — the people who have the power to approve and fund projects. As a starting point, consider addressing topics connected to the themes you will develop this year in your program. For example:</p><ul><li>Failures of retaining walls  </li><li>Failures of suspension bridges  </li><li>Importance and justification of arches  </li><li>Role of surveying in engineering</li><li>Role of waterways and pipelines  </li></ul><p>You will work to convince your audience that your project is in need of undertaking and that you are the person to undertake it. The more specific and actionable your idea is, the more persuasive you are likely to be to influence your audience. Persuading audience members that disagree with you requires that you think about why they disagree with you, identify areas where these audience members can be moved, and speak to those areas in a way that highlights your shared interests.</p><p>You will then draft a short written version that follows the genre, norms, and conventions of engineering proposals (summarize problem, known information, explain why problem must be addressed). The project should be original work, even if the ideas you are exploring have already been researched by others.</p><p>The idea will likely change through the process of the subsequent assignments, but should be clearly situated within the field of civil engineering.</p><p>In addition to the textbook (particularly, Chapter Six: “Short Reports, Proposals, Technical Documents" pages 97-98), additional proposal formatting guidelines can be found at the University of Toronto Engineering Handbook (http://ecp.engineering.utoronto.ca/online-handbook/types-of- documents/proposals/). Note: Your proposal will be much shorter and condensed than the examples on the website. Use these resources to guide your organization and structure. Some adaptation will be necessary as you consider your audience and purpose for this task.</p><p>Notes on the assignment:</p><p>The oral pitch schedule will be posted the week before the presentations</p><p><strong>The written portion is due Week 5 at the start of class</strong></p><p>You will lose up to 10% if your presentation is more than 30 seconds under or over the target time</p></td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Progress Report</td><td><p><strong>Part 1: Technical summaries (Group Poster Presentation)</strong></p><p>Choose a key element (e.g. an important concept, a piece of machinery, a process) of one of your projects.</p><p>In groups of 2 or 3, you will provide a technical summary of that element for a public, non-specialist audience. You will present a summary of the project element as a poster presentation on a standard 24x36 inch poster board using a combination of written and graphic communication. You should provide references on the poster.</p><p>Consider both short written summaries (see Ch. 11 of Ewald), and technical graphics (see Ch. 10).</p><p><strong>Please tell me your groups by the end of 4th February</strong>, as I will put anyone who doesn’t have a group into a group at that time.</p><p><strong>Due Date: 25th February</strong></p><p>NOTE: We may be involved in a public displaying of the posters we create, alongside students from other sections of Engineering Communication on evening in February over in one of the Engineering buildings. It’s an opportunity to see what other students are doing and have people see your work and communication skills.</p><p>While attendance at the event is not mandatory, groups will get a 5% bonus on this assignment for attending the presentation night and displaying their poster.</p><p><strong>Part 2: Research Abstract</strong></p><p>In this assignment, you will continue the work you proposed in the first assignment, preparing a 2-3 page progress report in the form of a Research Abstract that summarizes and provides an update on your proposed solution. It will be both informative and persuasive.</p><p>The abstract should provide information relevant to solutions to the problem you articulated in your proposal and continue to advocate for a particular solution/recommendations. Provide updates on any setbacks, challenges, and changes that you can imagine having occurred.</p><p>Your audience for this report will be moderately technical—a panel of decision makers who know about as much as you do about engineering; however, other decision makers, such as executives, must also be able to understand your work and the progress on the project.</p><p>See the report guidelines discussed in class and found at the University of Toronto Engineering Handbook ( http://ecp.engineering.utoronto.ca/online-handbook/types-of-documents/short-reports/ ) as well as the textbook.</p><p>You should:</p><ul><li>Summarize what has been accomplished</li><li>Supply information about any problems</li><li>Describe actions you will take to resolve the problems</li></ul><p>Also, take into account the document design principles that we have discussed in class, in addition to using professional tone and following engineering conventions.</p><p><strong>Due: 4th March </strong></p></td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Recommendation Report</td><td><p>For the final project you will create a policy brief aimed at a clear stakeholder audience.  </p><p>A policy brief is a document that explains current research in clear terms for a non- expert, highlighting the most salient takeaways of the research and typically making one or more policy recommendations.</p><p>Instructions</p><p>Your paper or project will draw on your research, specifically 3-4 peer-reviewed research articles on civil engineering. You will be advising a specific policy-making audience on your recommendations regarding a particular relevant topic. In your solution and recommendation, you are encouraged to take into consideration ethical, legal, and societal issues that affect your stakeholders.</p><p>A formal policy brief includes the following sections:  </p><ul><li>Title</li><li>Executive summary</li><li>Intro/summary of problem  </li><li>Explanation of results  </li><li>Policy recommendation(s)  </li><li>Works Cited  </li></ul><p>Your project should:  </p><ul><li>identify and address a specific policy-making audience</li><li>synthesize the research on a topic (based on 3 research articles from major peer-reviewed journals)</li><li>explain the current research on this topic in clear, non-technical language  </li><li>highlight the features of the research most relevant for policy makers and stakeholders</li><li>make one or two recommendations based on your synthesis of the research  </li><li>In order to guide your research and your reports, think of your reports as answering this question: How should my audience (stakeholders) understand the topic and how should they respond?  </li></ul><p>We will discuss the required sections and formatting and analyze samples in class, but for this assignment please also see https://writingcenter.unc.edu/policy-briefs/.</p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>The assumption is that you will continue with the same topic you have been working on so far in the course.

Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors.

A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.
