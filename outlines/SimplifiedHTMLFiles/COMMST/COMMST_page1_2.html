  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>COMMST 100:</div>
<p>Focuses on the one-to-one, face-to-face communication in both the personal and professional realms. Such topics as verbal and non-verbal interactions, listening, and the better management of interpersonal communication will be studied.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>COMMST 100 is a course that explores interpersonal communication and how people make meaning in one-on-one situations. In this course, we will work to understand more fully how we communicate (and are communicated to) in the world we live in and to develop the tools to research, apply, and practice key interpersonal communication concepts in our everyday lives. Students will be encouraged to identify, negotiate, and challenge existing communicative norms as they explore a range of interpersonal and intrapersonal issues that include culture, identity, and power. Over the course of the term we will have the opportunity to gain a greater understanding, as well as build our skills, in such areas as listening, language, nonverbal communication, expression of emotion, conflict resolution, intimacy, and agency.</p><p>COMMST 100 will consistently allow students to connect what they are learning about interpersonal communication to the experience of communicating and maintaining relationships. Readings and discussions in this class may challenge your attitudes, your unconsciously held beliefs, or your positions or current understandings. This may feel uncomfortable at times, but discomfort can be an important part of learning. In order to ensure a safe and open space for all students to converse and learn productively, it is vital that we conduct our discussions with professionalism and respect.</p>

  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Understand the complexity of communication as a human process of shared meaning- making in the context of power, history, and culture</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Increase your capacity to recognize and enhance yours and others’ agency – the ability to make a difference in the world for yourself and others – and understand the implications of your communication behaviours for yourself and others</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Understand communication as a practice and improve your critical and creative communication competencies by developing your ability to use writing and other media of communication to create meaning</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Practice responsiveness to different audiences and express yourself intentionally to specific audiences. This means treating other people not as passive recipients but as active collaborators in shaping communication, and entails anticipating, reflecting, modeling, researching, and consulting with communities, publics, and individuals</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cultivate your curiosity, openness, and willingness to take on challenges. This entails opportunities for student-directed inquiry, challenge and risk-taking, and reflection on your roles and responsibilities</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reflect on your role in fostering the public good (the multifaceted well-being of individuals and groups), begin to imagine a better future, and make decisions in your communication that can transform the communities to which you belong</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Recognize diverse linguistic practices and modes of expression as resources for writers and speakers</td>

<td>Exceeds assignment guidelines; strong and consistently applied definition of audience and purpose; thoughtful and innovative adaptation of the subject to the audience’s needs; subject developed and organized at every level for listener comprehension; speaker uses language appropriately, effectively and even inventively; maintains relaxed, inviting delivery free of verbal fillers and distractions; cites sources appropriately both in spoken and written work; submits well prepared required materials.</td>
<td>A (80-100%)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Meets assignment guidelines well; purpose and audience clearly defined; format consistently appropriate to audience and subject; subject supported with specifics as well as generalities; speaker maintains an economy of expression; information provided is sufficient to audience needs and coherently explained; speaker makes appropriate word choices. Citations clearly stated both on the outline and during delivery; speaker submits all required materials. Delivery may demonstrate signs of nervousness (pace, reading, etc.) but not sufficiently to interfere with the audience’s comprehension. Minor revisions required.</td>
<td>B (70-79%)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Meets assignment guidelines; adequate use of format, organization, and content to meet audience needs; speaker demonstrates some problems with audience adaptation, content, organization, or format, but not to the extent that the presentation fails to meet minimal expectations. Citations adequately present; submitted materials may be poorly prepared. Delivery awkward in several categories, but again—meets minimal expectations. Considerable revision required.</td>
<td>C (60-69%)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Does not meet important requirements of the assignment; inadequate use of format; poor development of subject for audience needs; inadequate awareness of audience and/or purpose; problems with organization, content, logic, research and citations; ineffective use of language; delivery sufficiently poor to impede reception of presentation. Required materials poorly prepared or absent. Serious revision required.</td>
<td>D (50-59%)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fails to meet most of stated assignment requirements: lack of focus on a subject; unsatisfactory format; lack of audience awareness and/or purpose; inadequate content poorly developed; lack of logical connection between parts of presentation and/or ideas; ineffective and/or careless use of language; absence of prepared materials. While delivery may be adequate, revision is pointless: speaker should start a new assignment and take the course more seriously.</td>

<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Assignment</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td><td><strong>Value</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Journals: Six per term at 10% each with the lowest mark dropped</td><td><p>You will write six journal entries throughout the term. The lowest mark will be dropped. You have the opportunity to choose from the nine weeks of prompts given in the assignment guidelines, and you will  submit your journals between week two and week eleven (each journal is due on Thursdays at 11:59 pm of the week we take up the material in class). You may choose which prompts you respond to, although you <strong>MUST</strong> do <strong>either the Week 2 or Week 3</strong> journal (you cannot make up the grade for this journal even if you complete six other journals). I strongly encourage you to space your journals out so that you are not doing all of them at the beginning or the end of the course. <strong>The journals are to be submitted on the Thrusday after the lecture at 11:59 p.m.</strong> Your entries should be roughly two typewritten, double- spaced pages each although they can go slightly over. Divide your journal entry into two components: “theory/observation” and “reflection on self.” While the amount you write under each heading may change week to week, this format allows you to address each area regularly.</p><p><strong>Assessment</strong></p><p><strong>You are asked to participate in self assessment for these journals. When you submit your work, you will include your self assessment at the end of your submission. Once I have read your work, I will consider your assessment and mark accordingly.</strong></p></td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>Group Contract</td><td>You and your group will write a contract outlining your expectations for communication and sharing workload this term. List group members. Decide how often you will communicate and in what manner. Decide how you will divide the workload and handle conflicts. Each member of the group will hand in an identical contract—this indicates agreement. Handing in a clear contract will earn 5%. This is not a graded assignment; each person who hands it in gets full credit and each person who does not hand it in or who hands in an obviously careless contract will receive zero.</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Group Presentation 1: Talking Points</td><td>In the first weeks of class, you will have the opportunity to choose your working group. Working with your group, together prepare a short (roughly fifteen minute) discussion for the first part of class. The discussions will connect to the week’s reading but will not summarize the week’s reading. Instead, together you will choose one major idea that sparked interest and curiousity. For class engagement, you can ask pointed questions, ask the group to engage in a game, bring in a link to an easy-to access artifact (an advertisement, news article, etc.). Your job will be to engage the class and apply what we are reading to people’s own opinions, experience, etc. Sign up for this assignment is on a first-come/first-served basis starting during week two of classes. No more than two talking points will be scheduled per week. This is a shared grade between group members.</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Group Presenation 2: Final Presenation</td><td>You and your group will create a fifteen-minute videotaped presentation exploring a problem in interpersonal communication and proposing a solution for that problem. This presentation will involve research into a specific issue related to interpersonal communication and creating good reasons for following your proposed solution. We will show the video presentations in the last week of class and you and your group will answer questions surrounding your proposal. This is a shared grade.</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>Attendance and Participation</td><td><p>This evaluation category is based on your punctual arrival to class and on your active, enthusiastic, and respectful participation in class discussions and group activities. The expectations are that you attend all classes except in cases of illness, and you email me to let me know of illness in a timely fashion. Initiating conversation, risk-taking, cooperative behaviour, and the quality of contributions in class are important criteria. A good participation grade doesn’t necessarily mean that you speak more than anyone else in the class; it means that you come to class having done the reading and are prepared to speak;  you speak thoughtfully; you add real contributions; you respond to others’ contributions with care. If you are shy of speaking up, you can work on your grade over the term by getting to the point that you can speak once per class, and it helps to involve yourself in smaller group discussions. Disrespect and failure to meet class policies will severely impact this grade.</p><p>Note: if this class moves online or if conditions otherwise create difficulty for attendance, I will create discussion boards on Learn. Participation on discussion boards will then count towards your participation grade.</p></td><td>20%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p> </p>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as self reflection, critical thinking skills and interpersonal communication. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience.

However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.
