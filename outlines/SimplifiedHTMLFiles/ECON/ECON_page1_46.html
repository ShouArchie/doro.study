  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ECON 322:</div>
<p>This course covers the core topics needed to estimate linear models using ordinary least squares and to interpret estimates for cross-sectional data. Students will learn to interpret the coefficients of linear models for continuous and discrete regressors, to conduct reliable inference for different specifications of the error term, and to determine which model is the most suitable among the class of linear models. Students will be introduced to a statistical software package and will be required to complete regular computer-based assignments throughout the course using economic data.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Students will be introduced to a statistical software package and will be required to complete regular computer-based assignments throughout the course that either: (i)  simulate the statistical distribution of the least squares estimator under an assumed model; or (ii) estimate the parameters of an assumed model using a sample of data from the real world.</p><p>The statistical software package used in this course is R. It runs on Windows, Mac or Linux and can be downloaded for free at <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</a>. It is also available in any Arts computer labs. You will be trained to use it in class and in tutorial sessions. If you have a computer, you should go to the above link and install R before the first tutorial session. It is also recommended, but not required, to install R-Studio, which is also available for free at <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">https://www.rstudio.com/</a>. It is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R. It greatly facilitates the use of R.</p>

<p>I do not require you to purchase the textbook by Wooldridge. I will provide you with all the material needed for the courses. Note that you may need this textbook for ECON 323, so if you find a cheap option to purchase it, I recommend you go ahead. Also, having at least one textbook is useful if you are planning on taking more advance courses or looking for a jobs related to data analysis. </p><p>The second textbook is a good reference for using R. The best way to learn a software like R is to practice, and this textbook shows you how to reproduce everything you'll see in the Wooldridge textbook. I will, however, provide you with all the material needed for this course.</p>

<p><strong>Exams: </strong>Topics covered in all exams will be given in class. Practice questions are available for each topics and they come from past exams. Past exams with solution will also be provided. The best way to prepare for the exams is to come to class, read the notes and work on the exercises. If you have hard time understanding the material, do not wait too long before asking for help. I am available several hours a week to answer questions. A small proportion of the exams may also include questions related to R. The best way to prepare is to go to the tutorials and work on each assignment on your own. </p><p><strong>Assignments: </strong>All assignment must be produced by R-Markdown and students must upload the Rmd and PDF files on Learn to to get a mark. For some assignments, a minimum grade in quizzes is required in order to have access to the drop box. The TA will go through each quiz in the tutorial sessions. It is highly recommended to start each assignment as soon as possible, because it may be very challenging to try to complete them in a day or two.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
</p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Policy Regarding Assignments</h4><p>All assignments must be produced individually. It is encouraged to work in groups, but the final documents uploaded to Learn must be your own with unique coding and/or interpretation. Any similarity in the coding or interpretation will be reported as a violation of academic integrity. The following is considered academic misconduct and will be reported to the Associate Dean of Arts:</p><ul><li>Copying codes or interpretation from another student.</li><li>Give access to your answers to other students: If two copies are similar, both students are penalised even if only one of them copied.</li><li>Use codes from an online AI. This is very easy to verify, because it also recommend the same code. Anything that deviates from the codes provided in my note will raise suspicion. Because of this, I only accept codes from my notes.</li><li>Use  codes from any outside sources.</li></ul><p>Note that you are allowed to copy and paste the codes from my notes. </p><p>The marking scheme for assignments are</p><ul><li>0/10 if not submitted or have completed less than 50% of the questions.</li><li>5/10 if  completed between 50% and 75% of the questions.</li><li>7/10 if completed all questions, but I notice little effort answering them. This includes no effort in the interpretation (a few words or one or two short sentences when more is required), reproducing errors that were explained in previous assignments or not presenting the results in a well formatted document. We will explain what we mean by "well formatted" in class and tutorial sessions</li><li>10/10 If completed all questions in a satisfactory way.</li></ul><p>Nowhere I mention that the answers to the questions must be right. As long as I see effort trying to answer the questions, you get full mark. It is therefore useless to try to get answers from your classmates.  There is no benefit in terms of points, you learn nothing by doing it and it puts you at risk of violating academic integrity. </p><p>If you submit your assignment late, a penalty per day will be applied to your mark. The penalty starts after being 1 hour late according to the following rule: -3/10 if 1 hour to 24 hours late, -6/10 if 24.001 to 48 hours late -10/10 if more than 48 hours late.</p><h4>Accommodation for Missed Assessments</h4><p>If you miss a midterm and have an approved accommodation, the weight of the midterm will be shifted to the final exam. </p><p>All assignments must be submitted. Learning how to create reports using R is a mandatory component of the course. Therefore, you get 0 for any assignment you do not submit. If you cannot submit it on time due to illness or other extenuating circumstances and you have an approved accommodation, the deadline will be extended. </p><p>If the solution is posted before your new approved deadline, you may be asked to do a different assignment. </p><p>If the access to the drop box is conditional on obtaining a minimum grade in quizzes, you must complete this requirement before submitting the assignment. To avoid having to complete the quiz and assignment in a short time, I recommend you start working on them as soon as they are made available.</p><h4>Applications for Accommodation</h4><p>Students applying for accommodation due to illness or extenuating circumstances should submit their documentation (verification of illness forms, narratives concerning circumstances) to the Arts Undergrad Office using the form available at  </p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Accommodations for illness or extenuating circumstances | Arts (uwaterloo.ca)</a></p><p>Instructors have a VIF system window linked to Quest that lists students’ exemptions (including self-declared absences).  Both the category of exemption granted, and the relevant dates appear in the system.  This procedure is meant to protect student privacy.  For further information on the process, see the page listed above.</p><p>Discretion regarding the form the accommodation takes rests with the course instructor.  Guidelines are described in the course calendar,</p><p><a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">Undergraduate Studies Calendar | University of Waterloo (uwaterloo.ca)</a></p><h4>Economics Department Deferred Final Exam Policy</h4><p>All deferred Final Exam requests for economics courses are administered by the Economics Undergraduate Office.

However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as coding and interpreting results. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
