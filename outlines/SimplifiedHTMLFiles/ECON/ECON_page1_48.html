  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ECON 323:</div>
<p>This course covers the most important methods used in applied economics research beyond the least-squares estimator. It starts by exploring solutions to the endogeneity problem in detail, emphasizing proper ways of conducting causal inference. It extends the methods covered in ECON322 to the case in which the data are observed over time. Students will learn how to estimate and interpret dynamic models and how these models affect our ability to do inference. The course also covers methods for data in which the response variable is either qualitative, with or without multiple levels, or count data. For that purpose, it introduces students to maximum likelihood estimation, and the estimation of models by probit, logit, and Poisson regressions. Assignments have the same data-based focus as in ECON322.</p>

<h4>Midterm Weighing</h4><p>Your best midterm (individually) will count for 30% and your worst for 20%. Midterms will be held during regular class time.</p><h4>Policies concerning missed midterms</h4><p><br/>You will write your midterm during class time. If you cannot write the midterm with the class due to extenuating circumstances, please get in touch with me within two business days. Through email, we can evaluate what will be needed in terms of documentation (usually a self-declaration of illness form, VIF or other self-declaration as per UW's policies). For students with suitable documentation, the weight will be transferred to the final exam held in December.</p><h4>Policies concerning assignments </h4><p>All assignments are worth 5% each, for a total of 15%. </p><p>Collaboration on assignments is encouraged, but plagiarism is not. Stating who you worked with on the assignment is optional. You must hand in your own hand-written (except for the computer code and output) copy of the assignment either in person in class or on Crowdmark. Assignments will contain both an analytic and a computer-based part, for which you must use Stata or R. If you wish to use a different software package than Stata or R, you must obtain the instructor's agreement one week before handing in the assignment. The instructor and TAs will not support using software packages other than Stata and R. Stata can be used in Arts Computing Labs (PAS-1237) free of charge R can be downloaded onto your personal machine and used in the PAS-1237 lab.  </p><p>Assignments handed in after the correction in class will be given a grade of 0 unless a self-declaration of illness form (or similar suitable documentation) has been submitted  In cases where the student could not complete the assignment by the deadline due to documented extenuating circumstances, the weight will be transferred to the final exam held in December. </p><p>Please see below, under Administrative Policy, the policy relevant to generative AI for this class. The answers to the assignment produced by myself/the TA will generally be considered to be correct, over the ones produced by generative AI when they are different.  </p><h4>Policy on remarking of Tests</h4><p>If you feel that your test was not appropriately marked, you must advise the instructor within 10 calendar days of the test being handed back to the students in class.  Note that if you want your test re-graded, I will remark the entire test (your mark may go up or down as a result of this).</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Attendance Policy</h4><p>Although presence in class is not required, it is highly recommended to attend classes.  If you miss a class, you are responsible for making up for it, whatever the circumstances.  If you are ill or exhibit COVID-19 symptoms, please do not attend class and get in touch with me. I will give you access to asynchronous class recording I used in other online offerings of ECON 323 if the length of your absence warrants it. During the last 24 hours before a midterm or final, I will not answer questions concerning material covered in class if you were absent and did not make a reasonable effort to catch up.</p><h4>Electronic Device Policy</h4><p>You are welcome to use your laptop during class time. Students who use cell phones during class time will be asked to leave.</p><p>The use of recording devices is prohibited during class time.  If you have a disability documented by the AccessAbility Office that warrants the use of a recording device in class, this must be specified as part of your Accommodation plan.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations"><u>accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</u></a> under the<u> </u>Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i><u>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</u></i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  </p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website</a> </p><h4>Accommodating religious, creed, and spiritual observances </h4><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp"><u>accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</u></a> under the<u> </u>Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i><u>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</u></i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. Students can complete the Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest, which will inform their instructors of the potential conflict for certain dates. Students must consult with their instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. The self-declaration form for short-term absences may also be used by students requiring an absence of two days or less during the Formal Lecture Period.</p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><h4>Declaring Absences</h4><p>For all of the following categories of absence students are responsible for getting in touch with their course instructors as soon as possible to discuss possible accommodations for the missed course component(s). The course instructor will determine how the missed work is accommodated. Absences will be accommodated according to the<a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations"> academic regulations section of the undergraduate calendar</a>. </p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness or extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness Form</a> (VIF) that is completed and signed by a healthcare practitioner. The VIF indicates the determination by a care provider of the degree of incapacitation for a given period. The VIF should then be submitted by the student to the must be uploaded and submitted through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other"><u>Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</u></a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once approved, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  </p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  </p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  </p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.
