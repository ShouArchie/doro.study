<p>Microeconomics is the study of economic behaviour of individual consumers and firms, and the distribution of total production and income among them. It involves the determination of prices through the optimizing behaviour of economic agents, with consumers maximizing their wellbeing and firms maximizing their profits. Macroeconomics takes a wider view of the economy; it studies the overall performance of an economy including growth in incomes, changes in the overall level of prices and the employment and unemployment rates. This course offers an introduction to the basic theories in microeconomics and macroeconomics.</p><p> </p>

<p><strong><u>Midterm Exams</u></strong></p><ul><li>Midterm #1 will be held in class on Wednesday February 12, and Midterm #2 will be held in class on Wednesday March 19.
