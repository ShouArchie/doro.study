<p><strong>Course Introduction: </strong>Governments of industrialized countries take part in a wide range of economic activities. Much of economics seeks to uncover whether this extensive government involvement benefits or hurts these countries’ citizens. In this introductory microeconomics course, we study the key concepts and tools of economics through the lens of the question: How big should the government be? Economic rationales for government involvement in economic activity motivate our study of consumer choice, competitive and strategic interaction, markets, taxation, production, trade, and welfare measurement.</p><p><strong>Overview of Course Schedule:</strong> </p><ul><li>In week 1 we learn about how economists model behavior. The focus is the <u>rational behavior assumption</u> and marginal analysis.</li><li>By week 4 we will learn <u>why economists favor allocation of resources through markets</u> over allocation by command and control. The concepts covered during weeks 2-4 include indifference curves, budget constraint, the Edgeworth’s box, competitive equilibrium, Pareto efficiency, and the first welfare theorem.</li><li>By week 8 we will learn that <u>externalities are an important economic rationale for imposing taxes and subsidies</u>. The concepts covered during weeks 5-8 include the utility function, game theory, payoff matrix, best response, Nash equilibrium, extensive-form game-tree, subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium, backward induction, externalities, taxes, and subsidies.</li><li>By week 11 we will learn why economists believe that generally <u>more competition is good</u> for society, and why some business people believe that competition is for losers. The concepts covered during weeks 9-11 include production, production possibilities frontier, trade, absolute and comparative advantage, supply and demand model, consumer surplus, imperfect competition, monopoly, and oligopoly.</li><li>In week 12 we will return to the study economic rationales for government intervention in economic activity, focusing on <u>departures from rationality, asymmetric information, and inequality</u>.</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Problem Sets: </strong>Problem sets are distributed <u>weekly</u> through learn.uwaterloo.ca. <u>Students do not submit answers to the problem sets</u>; it is assumed that students make the best choices for themselves regarding the timely completion (or untimely completion or non-completion) of problem sets. Model answers to most problem set questions are distributed through learn.uwaterloo.ca.</p><p><strong>Class Slides and Notes: </strong>Class slides and notes are distributed through learn.uwaterloo.ca. The distributed slides do not include all slides shown in class. The notes are not a substitute for lectures. </p><p><strong>Textbook: </strong>My lectures and problem sets <u>do not follow a textbook</u>. No textbook is required for the Midterm Exams.  No textbook is required for the Final Exam. To the benefit of those who still would like to study using a textbook as well, I will mention some recommended textbooks in the first class. </p><p><strong>Additional Resources: </strong>All students are encouraged to study one or more of the following throughout the semester to improve their understanding of the economy, economics and economists:</p><ul><li><u>Read newspapers</u>, such as New York Times/Wall Street Journal/Washington Post/Globe and Mail/National Post. Search daily for articles that mention "economy", "economics" or "economist".</li><li><u>Follow economists</u> on a social media platform such as X, Truth Social, or Bluesky. Or read economics blogs such as www.marginalrevolution.com.</li><li><u>Explore new economics research papers.</u> NBER working paper series gives an easy weekly glimpse into what economists are working on: https://www.nber.org/papers (scroll down).</li><li><u>Explore any economics textbook.</u> All "Introduction to Microeconomics" textbooks cover the same material. ANY EDITION is fine as economic theory has not changed for 50 years. If you have a mathematical/analytical background, the best starting point is Hal Varian's "Intermediate Microeconomics: A Modern Approach" (any edition) is the best resource.</li><li><u>Use ChatGPT/Other LLMs.</u> Try to learn throughout the semester what economics questions LLMs can answer correctly and what they cannot.</li></ul><p><strong>ChatGPT/LLMs/GEN AI in Grading: </strong>ChatGPT/Other LLMs/Other generative AI maybe used to grade some parts of exams and quizzes. </p><p><strong>Midterm Dates: </strong>All midterm exams are in-class during regular class times </p><ul><li><strong>Midterm Exam 1: Tuesday, Jan 21</strong></li><li><strong>Midterm Exam 2: Tuesday, Feb 11</strong></li><li><strong>Midterm Exam 3: Tuesday, Mar 18</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Final Exam Date: </strong>Will be held during official UW exam period -- TO BE SCHEDULED BY THE REGISTRAR. </p>

Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.
