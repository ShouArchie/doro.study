  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ECON 212:</div>
<p>Game theory analyzes the strategic interaction between agents. It has applications in various fields including economics, law, political science, biology, and computer science. This course introduces the basic tools of game theoretic analysis and examines applications such as auctions, business strategy, and curbing carbon emissions. The course includes an experiential learning component where students play strategic games against each other.</p>

<p>Game Theory is the study of strategic interactions between agents where the outcome for an agent depends not only on her choice of action but also on the actions of other players. This course is an introduction to Game Theory. We will develop game theoretic tools that can be used to analyze all sorts of situations including a game of poker, negotiations, auctions, military strategy, or the inability of the world community to curb carbon emissions. We will develop methods for determining best strategies for the different players and for determining the equilibrium outcomes of games. </p><p>The course will also have an important hands-on component. You will put the theory into action by playing games against fellow students. These games will teach you to think strategically. But beware, theory and practice don’t always line up!</p>

<p><strong>Important Notes on Assessments:</strong></p><p>Students who write the midterm exam but do better on the final exam will have half of the weight of the midterm shifted to the final.  Thus, your final mark would be 35% Games, 10% midterm, and 55% final.</p><p>While the games are nominally worth 35% of the final mark, <strong>it is possible to score above 100% or below 0% in a given game!!</strong>  A negative grade on a game implies that not only do you get 0 on that game, you also lose grades from other games!  On the other hand, since you can get above 100% in a given game, games could in principle contribute more than 35% to your final mark.</p><p><u>Collusion in games</u>: Collusion in games is not allowed and is a breach of academic integrity. You are allowed, even encouraged, to discuss the game and broad strategies with your classmates, with friends, with family, etc.  But you cannot coordinate your strategies in any way. The games are designed so that there are limited opportunities for collusion anyway, and moreover, any attempt at collusion is likely to raise suspicion and a follow up from me. Please engage with the games in good faith.  And have fun!</p><p><u>Late submission of strategies for games</u>: Because of the nature of the games (each student submission plays against all others), late submission will not be accepted and will earn a grade of 0. Failure to submit will also earn a grade of 0 for that game.</p><p>That said, I understand that sometimes emergencies or other unexpected things happen. Therefore, I will "forgive" a single non-submission over the course of the term. There is no need for you to justify why you didn't submit a game - at the end of the term, I will transfer the weight of a single game that you did not submit to all of the other games (including any other non-submitted ones that earned 0). If you did not submit more than one game, the one worth most will have its weight transferred, and you will get 0 for the others. Also note that this forgiveness applies to your grade but not to the competition for Game Theory Grand Master.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p><p>You will be expected to know algebra well enough to solve systems of equations. Some calculus is strongly recommended but not absolutely necessary.</p><p><strong>My Expectations:</strong></p><ul><li>You will stay on top of the material</li><li>You will participate fully in the games and submit them on time</li><li>You will complete the assigned problems from the book</li></ul><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Absence from Exams:</strong></p><p>Failure to write an exam (midterm or final) results in a grade of zero. Exceptions will only be made under the most extreme circumstances, with a written note, and according to the policies of the department of economics and faculty of Arts.</p><p>If you miss the midterm due to illness or other excused absence, the 20% weight will be shifted to the final examination.</p><p>If you miss the final exam it is your responsibility to petition the department of economics as per the regulations for the opportunity to write a make-up exam.</p><p><strong>Course Outline:</strong><br/>The following is a tentative course schedule/outline and could be updated as we proceed<br/>through the course. The course content will primarily be delivered in class, but I may on<br/>occasion upload a lecture (slides with voiceover) to make more time in class to discuss games and or to make up for a missed lecture.</p><h4>Economics Department Deferred Final Exam Policy</h4><p>All deferred Final Exam requests for economics courses are administered by the Economics Undergraduate Office. Please consult the Deferred Exam Policy at </p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/economics/undergraduate/resources-and-policies/deferred-final-exam-policy.">https://uwaterloo.ca/economics/undergraduate/resources-and-policies/deferred-final-exam-policy.</a></p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>

Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
