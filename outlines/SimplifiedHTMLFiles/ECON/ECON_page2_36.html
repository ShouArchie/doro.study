<p>Innovation is the primary driver of economic growth and hence of improvements to our standard of living.  In this course we will study, both from a theoretical and empirical perspective, the incentives to innovate and how institutions and public policy shape these incentives.  We will examine the nature of ideas and innovation, intellectual property rights, technology clusters, knowledge spillovers and diffusion, whether immigration contributes to innovation, and numerous other topics. </p><p>Artificial intelligence is the disruptive technology of our age and has the potential to transform how we live and work. Therefore, much of the second half of the course will focus on the economics of AI. Through a combination of theory and empirical evidence, we will explore how to think about AI, how the technology is likely to transform the economy and society, its potential to increase productivity, and its likely impact on skills and jobs.</p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>The course will be divided into two roughly equal parts.  The first part will focus on the economics of innovation, primarily from a theory perspective, and will be lecture-based.  We will draw on Scotchmer’s textbook and other sources. </p><p> </p><p>The second part will be mainly empirical and in a discussion format. Every class we will discuss two empirical papers. You will be expected to read the papers ahead of time and take turns leading the discussion. Many of these sessions will focus on different aspects of artificial intelligence. </p><p> </p><p>The following is a tentative course outline and will be completed/updated as we proceed through the course.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Part 1: Economics of Innovation (Lectures)</u></strong></p><p><strong>Class 1: Introduction </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Class 2&amp;3: Innovation in Canada</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Class 4: Productivity in Canada</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Class 5: Efficiency in Markets for Innovation (Ch. 2)</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Class6: Incentivizing Innovation (Ch. 2)</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Class 7: Substitutable Ideas (Ch. 2)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Note: Assignment 1 is due at the beginning of class</strong></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Class 8: Intellectual Property Rights (Ch. 3)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Note: Assignment 2 is due at the beginning of class</strong></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Class 9: Optimal Patent Design (Ch. 4)</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Class 10: Uncertain Success (Ch. 4)</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Class 11&amp;12: Cumulative Innovation (Ch. 5)</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><u> </u></strong></p><p><strong>Class 13: Midterm</strong></p><p><strong><u> </u></strong></p><p><strong><u> </u></strong></p><p><strong><u>Part 2: Paper Sessions</u></strong></p><p><strong>Note: </strong>* starred readings are optional</p><p><strong><u> </u></strong></p><p><strong><u>Artificial Intelligence</u></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Class 14&amp;15: How to think about AI and its impacts (lectures)</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Class 16: AI and productivity I (Paper Session)</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Class 17: AI and productivity II (Paper Session)</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Class 18: AI TBD (Paper Session)</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Class 19: AI and jobs/skills (Paper Session) </strong></p><ul><li>Acemoglu, D. and P.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
