  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ECON 657:</div>
<p>This course will review the application of the tools and theory of economics to environmental problems.  The normative foundations of economic analysis will be discussed including efficiency, intergenerational equity and sustainability.  The design and implementation of environmental policy will be analyzed including the use of command and control regulation, market-based instruments, and legal liability.  Applications to various environmental issues may include global warming, trans-boundary pollution, and trade and the environment.</p>
