<p>This course is lecture based. There is no required text book for this course. The lecture slides cover a variety of standard macroeconomic topics. The acronyms and mathematical notation used in this course follows that of Abel, Bernanke and Smith's "Macroeconomics" text book. Should you wish to consult this text book, recent and previous editions are available for purchase, and a copy of the 2003 Abel, Bernanke &amp; Smith is available at Dana Porter library. However, this course was designed for learning directly from attending lectures, taking notes, and following the lecture slides, without the need for a text book.</p><p>CAUTION: the notation and even the macroeconomic models presented can vary subtly across textbooks. It is easy to become confused. </p><p>As such, I DO NOT recommend learning models or using study guides from alternative text books. </p><p>After you have completed the course, if you are interested in deepening your knowledge of Macroeconomics, or reading more about Macroeconomics in different frameworks, you might look into Mankiw and Scarth's "Macroeconomics,"  Krugman and Wells's "Macroeconomics," Ragan's "Macroeconomics," or for more advanced reading: Romer's "Advanced Macroeconomics." Even though the latter is 'advanced' it is very readable and enjoyable.  All of these texts have been in circulation for some time, and library copies or used versions should be readily available.</p><p>My own personal preference, once you have a solid understanding of the basics, is to learn from a variety of sources to improve perspective and reduce unintentional biases in the way you think about and analyze subject matter. Differences in approach and thought can also help to better understand the benefits and drawbacks of different economic theory and methods.</p>

<p><strong>General information about ECON 102 Mid-Term and Final Exam:</strong></p><ul><li>The Mid-term will be held in-class on February 12, during the class period. The format of the mid-term will be multiple-part short-answer questions.</li><li>The Final Exam time and location will be determined by the Registrar's office and posted with the official examination schedule. The format of the Final Exam will be similar to the Mid-Term Exam and will be cumulative.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>ECON 102 Policies:</strong></p><p> </p><p><i>Assignments-</i></p><ul><li>Assignments must be submitted on LEARN by the assigned due date and time. Late assignments receive a grade of zero.</li><li>Although students are encouraged to study and work together, but each student must submit their own assignment.  Assignments should be unique and any assistance should be cited. Any two or more students who submit identical assignments are in violation of Policy 72 and disciplinary measures may be imposed under Policy 71.</li><li>Late or missing assignments will receive a grade of zero, with the exception of approved medical documentation (see Declaring Absences section below). The instructor retains the right to accept non-medical documents at their discretion.</li></ul><p> </p><p><i>Attendance -</i></p><ul><li>Attending classes, asking relevant questions, and participating in the class improves understanding of the course material for you and for your classmates. When interacting in the class, I expect that you treat everyone with respect, and are supportive of the learning environment.</li></ul><p> </p><p><i>Missed Mid-Term-</i></p><ul><li>The weight of a missed mid-term will shift automatically to your final exam. No make-up will be held.</li><li>It is in your best interest to write the mid-term because I will automatically shift the weight of your mid-term to the final exam if you do better on the final. The mid-term is good practice for the final.</li></ul><p> </p><p><i>Missed Final Exam Policy -</i></p><ul><li>All deferred Final Exam requests for Economics courses are administered by the Economics Undergraduate Office.  A student who misses the final exam must follow the Deferred Final Exam Policy procedures found at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/economics/undergraduate/resources-and-policies/deferred-final-exam-policy"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/economics/undergraduate/resources-and-policies/deferred-final-exam-policy</u></a></li><li>The deferred exam will be substantially different than that written by the rest of the class.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Instruction Goals and Support:</strong></p><ul><li>My objective is to support your own individual learning goals, whether by answering questions during class/office hours/appointments/e-mail, or pointing you to further resources that will strengthen your ability to achieve your goals. Because achieving your goals is not just about effort. The appropriate tools, strategies, resources, and support systems are also important.</li><li>In order to achieve a healthy balance between work hours and personal life, there will be a finite amount of time I can dedicate to appointments and emails. I will do my best to respond quickly to emails and appointment requests; but, be aware that I may not have the time resources to meet all requests. I encourage you to plan in advance to avoid heavy demand times (e.g. test dates).</li><li>Many students at UW worry that they were admitted by mistake, that they aren’t smart enough, or feel that they do not belong. You are not alone in this feeling, and it should pass, but I want you to know that however you got to UW, we are glad you are here. Whether you have failed past courses or current tests, you are smart enough. You belong here, and I look forward to being a part of your learning process. More than that, different levels of understanding and diverse perspectives enrich the learning experience for all of us, I look forward to learning from you as well.</li><li>When determining your own learning goals, keep in mind that it may take more time or effort or support to achieve specific learning goals particularly if the goals are very high, or if you have not had the same level of preparation or experience as other students. Be kind to yourself, and know that most people will be adjusting their goals as the semester progresses. Also know that I am here to support your learning goals, whether they be to understand a subset of the econometric tools, to pass the course, or to achieve a high grade. Support does not mean simply handing out grades of course! Part of my job is to assign an appropriately earned grade for each of you in this course, but I am not here to judge you, and I do not equate lower grades with lower intelligence or worth (we all have different interests and goals in our learning and education journeys).</li><li>Finally, note that struggles are an important part of the process of learning and growing your abilities. Learning from our struggles helps us not only survive, but also thrive.</li></ul><p> </p>

The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p><p> </p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><p> </p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations. </a>Learn more about the <a href="https://www.anishinabek.ca/education-resources/gdoo-sastamoo-kii-mi/who-are-the-anishinaabeg/">Anishinaabeg</a>, <a href="https://www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com/">Haudenosaunee</a>, <a href="https://www.sixnations.ca/">Six Nations</a>, and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/knowledge-building/territorial-acknowledgement">territorial acknowledgement</a>. Another venue for learning, from Indigenous (Turtle Island) artists, writers, activists, scholars and leaders, is the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/about/indigenous-speakers-series">Indigenous Speaker Series</a>.</p><p> </p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>.
