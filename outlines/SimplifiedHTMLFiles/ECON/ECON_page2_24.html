  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ECON 637:</div>
<p>This course demonstrates the usefulness of economic analysis to the study of global governance.  Topics include the economic analysis of international trade, foreign direct investment, and international finance. Students with more advanced economics background (as a minimum, at least one economics course above the 100 level that focused on international economics or an equivalent applied course such as development economics, environmental economics) are recommended to replace 637 with one of a list of courses, including internationally oriented economics courses, some of the PSCI international political economy courses, or Faulty of Environment courses that include significant international political economy content.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is the core economics course for the graduate program in Global Governance, targeted to students with little previous background in Economics. The class will take a dual approach: approximately half of each week’s work will be dedicated to understanding economic concepts (Part I), while the other half will discuss economic approaches to global governance issues (Part II).</p><p>Part I: An understanding of basic economics, numerical literacy, and cost-benefit analysis are useful for an effective, evidence-based decision process by policymakers and policy analysts. The first part of each class will discuss the usefulness of economic concepts, theories, empirical approaches and elements of cost-benefit analysis to inform policy decisions. </p><p>Part II: The policy section of the class will begin by covering the basic theories of international trade and international finance, as essential stepping stones for an informed analysis of global economic issues. The inefficiency of the lack of cooperation in international trade policy-making and the importance of multilateral negotiations have long been recognized. However, there is still a significant amount of debate concerning the evolving needs the multilateral trading architecture needs to respond to. The importance of coordination on monetary and financial issues is emphasized by the fragility of the current system, showcased by the frequency and rapid global contagion characterizing modern financial crises. Persistant underdevelopment in many areas of the world is also recognized as a global issue requiring global solutions, while international coordination is becoming increasingly regarded as a precondition for effectively addressing environmental issues ranging from transboundary resource depletion to global warming. These will constitute the main topic areas explored in the policy sections of the course. </p>

<h3>Study Materials and other resources: </h3><p> </p><p>The course aims to achieve two main goals: to introduce important economics concepts, theories and empirical results, and to put them in a global-governance relevant context. No textbook exists for such a specific pedagogical goal, so we will rely on a variety of sources. </p><p><i>Weekly readings will be posted on UW Learn. </i></p><p> </p><p>However, we will refer repeatedly to free online CORE Econ resources, which are <strong>REQUIRED</strong>:</p><p>CORE Econ Education (2017).

There are several different reading materials due every week. That said, please use your judgment when allocating your time. The following <i>hints</i> may help:</p><p>- if it’s a relatively short piece: carefully read all of it and be prepared to discuss the main points.</p><p>- if the chapter/article/report is 100 pages long: skim-read it all and read the parts that communicate the substance of the work and sections that are interesting to you more thoroughly.</p><p>- if it’s a dense, jargon-heavy paper: try to get the main picture from the abstract, intro and conclusion and do not focus on any obscure technical points (unless you are into that kind of thing).</p><p>Most materials will be available online. Many of the weekly readings are journal articles, available online via the University of Waterloo Library website or VPN. </p><h4>Schedule:</h4><p>All students are required to read the materials for every section. </p><p>The course webpage on LEARN will provide the actual detailed list of readings used each week this term, including links to many readings additional to the textbooks. The LEARN Readings page will be updated (at least) weekly. </p><p>Normally a campus (or off-campus proxy via the UW library) internet connection may be required for free access to electronic journals. </p><p>I will make clear in class which of the readings are <i>mandatory</i>, which are <i>optional</i> or for <i>reference </i>only, and which are the subject of the following week’s position papers.</p>

<h2>Course Requirements, Expectations, and Standards: </h2><p><strong>Attendance: </strong>Students are expected to attend all weekly meetings and be actively involved in class throughout the term. </p><p><strong>Participation: </strong>Students are expected to fully engage with the readings and participate in all (synchronous and asynchronous) class discussions every week. Students should aim to cover all required readings before each class meeting. Each student should take an informed and reasoned position based on each of the reading materials, and a component of your grade will reflect this. (see below)</p><h2>Requirements and Evaluation: </h2><p>Consistent participation in discussions (10%), weekly response papers (10%), lead class discussion of one article (15%), a midterm exam (20%), a class presentation (15%) + a referee report (5%), and a final paper (25%) will make up your final grade. </p><h4>Participation + weekly response papers: 10%+15%</h4><p>This grade will be based on your weekly contributions to class and online forum discussions. A discussion forum will host students’ weekly response papers (see below). The expectation is that each student initiates at least one discussion post, reads and briefly responds to at least one other discussion post <i>each week</i>.</p><p>Readings for class discussion and short written assignments will be assigned each week. <u>One critical analysis item based on these readings</u> written up in a response paper (1 page max, double spaced) should be posted in the assigned discussion forum. This material will also constitute the basis for the in-person discussion part of each weekly meeting. Do not summarize the papers. Pick one or two issues you strongly agree/disagree with and discuss critically. These weekly position papers will be marked on a binary (completed=1 or not completed=0) scale, amounting to 10% of your grade. Additionally, two of the response papers will be randomly picked at the end of the term to be marked for content, for an additional 5% (2*2.5%).</p><h4>Midterm: 20%</h4><p>An in-class written assignment will include a few short-answer questions and several multiple-choice questions synthesizing the material covered to date. Tentative date: <i>Thursday, February 27th</i>.</p><h4>Discussion Leading: 15%</h4><p>Each student will act as Discussion Leader in one week of regular classes, except for the first week. During the first week: please <u>email me your top 5 topics (from Topic 3-Topic 11)</u> in decreasing order of preference. Discussion Leaders are responsible for both the <i>mandatory (M)</i> and the <i>optional (O)</i> readings for the week, and will lead the class discussion of the respective articles/chapters, by posing questions that stimulate discussion. </p><p>A guide for formulating useful questions can be found<a href="https://uvic470ecology.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/4/4/12445281/470_howtoleaddiscussion.pdf"> here</a>. </p><h4>Presentation + annotated bibliography + referee Report: 10% +5%+ 5%</h4><p>The last two classes are dedicated to student presentations. Each student will discuss the core argument of their final essay in a short class presentation and will submit an annotated bibliography. Each paper presentation will be assigned a <i>peer referee</i>, who will receive the material ahead of time (normally at least 3 days before) and will provide comments on the paper following the presentation. The intention is for each of you to receive <u>constructive feedback</u> on your work from your peers (referee and the rest of the class) <i>before</i> writing up the final papers.</p><h4>Final Essay: 20%</h4><p>This is a policy research paper on a specific topic relating your global governance interests to the broad themes of the course. Apply an economic lens to a (small) area of your Global Governance topic of interest. A maximum one-page proposal must be submitted to the instructor for approval as early in the term as possible, and no later than the <i>Reading Week.</i> An annotated bibliography is due at the time of the presentation. The final essay will be due on <i>April 10<sup>th</sup></i> and will consist of approximately 15 double-spaced pages. </p><p><i>Some guidelines: a minimum of 5 peer-reviewed academic sources should be used. There is no required citation style, just pick the one you are most familiar with and apply it correctly and consistently. More information on the final essay will be provided in class.</i></p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.
