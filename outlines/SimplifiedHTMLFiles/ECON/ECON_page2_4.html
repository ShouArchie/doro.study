<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ECON 412:</div>
<p>This course builds on ECON392 to give students a broader exposure to game theory. Possible topics include extensive games with imperfect information, evolutionary games, repeated games, as well as applications of game theory such as auctions and negotiations.</p>

<div>
<p>This course provides an in-depth exploration of strategic decision-making with uncertainty and its applications in economics, computer science, and beyond. The journey begins with <i>games of incomplete information</i>, introducing solution concepts such as Bayes-Nash equilibrium. We then delve into <i>higher-order beliefs</i>, belief hierarchies, and the framework of common knowledge. The course then transitions to <i>mechanism design and market design</i>, emphasizing their mathematical underpinnings and practical applications.</p><p>Key topics include single-agent models addressing <i>hidden characteristics</i> (adverse selection) and <i>hidden actions</i> (moral hazard). For multi-agent environments, we explore <i>dominant strategy and Bayesian implementation</i>, applying these concepts to real-world settings like <i>auction design</i>, <i>matching markets</i>, and <i>school choice problems</i>. This advanced treatment blends theoretical rigor with practical insights, equipping students with tools to analyze and design strategic interactions in complex settings.</p><p>Prerequisites: Econ 392 or equivalent. Familiarity with undergraduate-level calculus, statistics, and optimization is expected. Contact the instructor if unsure. </p>

<p><strong>Lecture notes</strong> are designed to be self-contained, and students are expected to attend class and take their own notes. Students proficient in LaTeX are encouraged to typeset their notes and share them with classmates to facilitate collaborative learning.  </p><p>For students interested in further exploration, the following optional readings can be useful:  </p><p><strong>Game theory</strong>: Martin Osborne's ``An Introduction to Game theory'' (2004, Oxford University Press) is a classical reference for undergraduate game theory. For a graduate-level treatment, consider Fudenberg and Levine's ``Game Theory'' (1993, MIT Press)</p><p><strong>Auctions</strong>: Paul Milgrom’s ``Putting Auction Theory to Work'' (2004, Cambridge University Press) is a seminal text that provides a comprehensive and practical approach to auction theory. It covers core concepts like revenue equivalence, optimal auction design, and applications across various market environments.</p><p><strong>Matching</strong>: Alvin E. Roth and Marilda A. Oliveira Sotomayor’s ``Two-Sided Matching: A Study in Game-Theoretic Modeling and Analysis'' (1992, Cambridge University Press) offers an in-depth examination of matching markets, including the stability of matchings, mechanisms like the Gale-Shapley algorithm, and applications to real-world problems such as school choice.</p><p>These texts are optional and intended for students with a strong interest in these specialized topics.  </p>

<p><strong>Class Participation:</strong><br/>You will be randomly asked to sign a name list without prior notice. Active participation is also expected, which includes paying attention, asking and answering questions, and helping classmates. Full participation marks will be awarded if you meet both criteria. If you only meet the first criterion (signing the list), you can expect a score of 70%. Since this is a small class, I can easily track everyone’s participation and progress.</p><p><strong>Problem Sets:</strong><br/>There will be three problem sets covering different topics, including Bayesian games, single-agent models, and multi-agent models. Grading will be based on completion on a 0-1 scale. Solutions will be posted on Learn and discussed in class. </p><p>Due dates and time will be announced on Learn in advance. Unless otherwise specified, the due time is Friday 5pm. Late submission will not be accepted under any circumstances. If an assignment is missed, its weight will be automatically redistributed to the final exam.</p><p><strong>Midterm:</strong><br/>The midterm will take place during the week after the term break. The exact date will be announced on Learn in advance. There will be no make-up test. Students who miss the midterm without a valid medical certificate or documentation will receive a mark of zero. Students with valid documentation will have the weight of the midterm redistributed to their final exam.</p><p> </p>

<div>
<h4>Classroom Environment</h4><p>This class is committed to maintaining a respectful and inclusive environment. Harassment, abuse, discrimination, or threats in any form—whether in person, via email, or through any other form of communication—will not be tolerated under any circumstances. Violations will be addressed in accordance with university policies.  </p><h4>Office Hours and Other Communication</h4><p>Students are required to schedule appointments with the instructor in advance via email before attending office hours. In the email, provide a brief description of the questions or topics you wish to discuss. This allows both the student and the instructor to prepare in advance, ensuring productive and meaningful discussions while making efficient use of time.  </p><p>Emails requesting special favors, unfair treatment, or those that violate the course policies outlined above will not receive a response. Students are expected to communicate professionally and adhere to course guidelines in all correspondence.  </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. </p><p>Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information">Quest</a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory">CAUT Guide to Acknowledging Traditional Territory</a>.</p>

<div>
<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken.
