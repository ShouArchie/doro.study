<div>
<p><strong>Course Materials on LEARN</strong>: I will post class announcements, problem sets and other course materials on LEARN. Students are responsible for staying updated with the course's LEARN page. </p><p><strong>Office Hours</strong>: Wednesdays 10h30-12h00. My office is located in HH131. There will be additional office hours before midterms, and these will be announced in class and on LEARN.</p><p><strong>Email Policy</strong>: Office hours and lectures are the appropriate venue for asking questions about the material from the course. Email is an inefficient method for communicating course content, and I will not respond to detailed question about the material other than during class or office hours. Email is appropriate for matters related to course administration, like questions about missed lectures, assignments or exams. </p>

<div>
<p>There is no required textbook for this class, and my lectures will be based on my own notes. Students are responsible for obtaining notes for lectures that they do not attend. </p><p>A very good online (and free) textbook is <i>Models in Political Economy, </i>by Martin Osborne, which is available on his website: </p><p>https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/</p><p>I will base some of my notes on sections of this book. This being said, the level of this textbook is closer to the graduate level, and is above the level at which I will teach this course. As you will see from browsing the textbook, there is an immense variety of topics that can be covered by a course in political economy and a single course cannot address them all. </p>

<p>-There are <strong>two</strong> assignments, each due a week or so before each midterm. The aim of assignments is to help you integrate the material from class and prepare you for the midterms. Teamwork is expected (and to some degree recommended), although each student must hand in their own, independently written, assignment. The assignments will consist of questions drawn for the course's problem sets, available on LEARN. The exact questions covered by the assignments will be announced on LEARN at least one week before the assignment's due date. Assignments must be submitted <strong>on paper and in person</strong> in the lecture on the date on which it is due.   </p><ul><li>Assignment 1, due in class Tuesday January 28.</li><li>Assignment 2, due in class Thursday March 6.</li></ul><p>Each assignment is worth 5% of your final grade. <strong>Late assignments will not be accepted. </strong></p><p>-In <strong>five </strong>instances during the term, I will ask an in-class participation question. Students will have 10-15 minutes to answer this question. Students will be encouraged to discuss among themselves before writing down their answers, which must be handed in at the end of that class. Each in-class participation question will be graded on a 0-1-2 basis. <strong>Each student can only hand in ONE sheet with their answer to the in-class participation question. Handing in a sheet for an absent classmate is an academic offence. </strong></p><p><strong>After receipt of suitable justification (see "Faculty of Arts Procedures for Declaring Absences" below), the weight of any missed assignment or in-class participation question is shifted to the next midterm.  </strong></p><p>- <strong>Midterm 1</strong> will be held in class on Thursday February 6. The material covered by the midterm will be specified in class and on LEARN prior to the test. </p><p>- <strong>Midterm 2</strong> will be held in class on Tuesday March 18. The material covered by the midterm will be specified in class and on LEARN prior to the test.</p><p><strong>A student who misses a midterm must file a suitable justification (see "Faculty of Arts Procedures for Declaring Absences" below). After this is done, a student must contact me to schedule a makeup exam. Midterm weights will not be shifted to any other course component.  </strong></p><p>-The remaining 40% of your grade consists of a <strong>final project/paper</strong>. There, I want you to use some of the tools from the course to build your own political economy model on a question you care about. I will break this up into steps.</p><ol><li>Come up with a <strong>question</strong> you want to address in a formal model. You must submit this in the relevant dropbox on LEARN on Monday February 24 at 17h00. This should not exceed one page, but you need to clearly lay out what your question is and why it is interesting and/or important. </li><li>Write down a simple <strong>model</strong> in which you can answer your question. Step 2.1: you must <strong>present</strong> your question along with your model in the lecture times reserved for this at the end of the term. Step 2.2: you must submit the <strong>written</strong> version of your question and model in the relevant dropbox on LEARN on Sunday April 6 at 17h00. At this point there is no analysis required, but the model must be complete and ready to be analysed. </li><li>Your <strong>final paper</strong> will be short: it must consist of a clear and compelling question and justification (updated from part 1); a simple model (updated from part 2); along with an answer to your question derived from within your model, accompanied by a brief discussion of its main strengths and shortcomings. You must submit this in the relevant dropbox on LEARN on Friday April 18 at 17h00.</li></ol><p>Basically, you want to think of this paper-writing exercise as coming up with your own problem set question and solution for some topic related to this course. You are strongly encouraged to think about your paper throughout the course and to come talk to me about it in office hours; this will make for a stronger final product. </p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought.

Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.
