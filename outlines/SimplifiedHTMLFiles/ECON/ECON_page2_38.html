  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ECON 701:</div>
<p>This course builds on the models and the techniques developed in Microeconomic Theory I.  Topics may include general-equilibrium analysis, game theory, the economics of information, mechanism design and applications of bargaining theory to the theory of markets.</p>

<div>
<p>Two Nobel prizes have been awarded in general equilibrium: Kenneth Arrow in 1972 and Gerard Debreu in 1983. It began as a key pillar of microeconomics, and now manifests itself in almost all of theoretical macroeconomics. Its earlier focus was on commodity markets, and has more recently shifted to financial markets. What makes the equilibrium “general” is the simultaneous consideration of two or more markets; for example, peanut butter and jelly or a bond and a stock. We will consider perfectly competitive markets; prices will be set in such a way to ensure market clearing. Common questions we will answer in these settings concern the existence and Pareto efficiency of equilibria.</p><p>There are two things you need to do to be successful in this course: come to lecture and do your homework (well, these are necessary but not sufficient conditions). Unlike other courses you may be used to, there will be very little reading. Why? I will cover some advanced topics directly from a combination of books and papers, which I list below but do not expect you to read. Lecture notes should be sufficient for full understanding of the course material. Try to expose yourself to the course material in as many ways as you can; this includes asking questions in lecture, emailing questions, coming to office hours, and forming study groups.</p>

<p>I have picked out what I think are the “main pillars” of general equilibrium and listed them in the course outline below. There will be a lot of problem solving, as these are theoretical/ mathematical models. I will be using calculus and linear algebra without review; expect a rigorous treatment of these topics below.</p><p>Positive theory (finish this before Midterm 1)</p><ul><li>Edgeworth box</li><li>Walras’ Law</li><li>Fixed points</li><li>Existence</li><li>Anything goes</li></ul><p>Normative theory (finish this before Midterm 2)</p><ul><li>First fundamental welfare theorem</li><li>The core</li><li>Externalities</li><li>Production</li><li>Second fundamental welfare theorem</li></ul><p>Incomplete markets</p><ul><li>Arrow securities</li><li>Fundamental theorem of asset pricing</li><li>Existence</li><li>First fundamental welfare theorem</li><li>Production with incomplete markets</li></ul><p>Presentations</p><ul><li>Rational expectations</li><li>Default</li></ul><p> </p>

However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Economics Department Deferred Final Exam Policy</h4><p>All deferred Final Exam requests for economics courses are administered by the Economics Undergraduate Office. Please consult the Deferred Exam Policy at </p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/economics/undergraduate/resources-and-policies/deferred-final-exam-policy.">https://uwaterloo.ca/economics/undergraduate/resources-and-policies/deferred-final-exam-policy.</a></p><p><strong>Applications for Accommodation</strong></p><p>Students applying for accommodation due to illness or extenuating circumstances should submit their documentation (verification of illness forms, narratives concerning circumstances) to the Arts Undergrad Office using the form available at  </p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Accommodations for illness or extenuating circumstances | Arts (uwaterloo.ca)</a></p><p>Instructors have a VIF system window linked to Quest that lists students’ exemptions (including self-declared absences).  Both the category of exemption granted, and the relevant dates appear in the system.  This procedure is meant to protect student privacy.  For further information on the process, see the page listed above.</p><p>Discretion regarding the form the accommodation takes rests with the course instructor.  Guidelines are described in the course calendar,</p><p><a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">Undergraduate Studies Calendar | University of Waterloo (uwaterloo.ca)</a></p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spaces/">multi-faith spaces</a> that students can use for faith-based practices. that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.
