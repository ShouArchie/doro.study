Once undertaken, managers must decide how to finance the projects, for example, by debt or equity. The course develops both the conceptual framework and the tools required for these decisions. The course assumes prior familiarity with probability, expected values, and variance.</p>

<p>The course grade will be based on review quizzes, two midterm exams, and a final examination, which will be held during the Official Examination Schedule<strong>. </strong>The midterm with the better mark will be worth 30% of your final grade, while the second-best midterm will be worth 25% of your final grade. The final exam will constitute 35% of your final grade and will be comprehensive (i.e., cover all course material from beginning to end). </p><p>Please note that the Learn website does not have an option to adjust weights for each student individually. I will set constant weights for each student of 25% for the first midterm and 30% for the second midterm in Learn, but I will be adjusting those weights individually in my Excel sheet when calculating final grades at the end of the semester. <br/><br/>There will also be a bonus grade up to 2% for participation (more on participation below under <strong>Participation</strong>). </p><h4>Review Quizzes</h4><ul><li>The purpose of the review quizzes is to help students identify and understand key concepts covered in the lectures and in the textbook.</li><li>The format of the quizzes will mainly be multiple-choice questions, but there may also be some true-false questions, or short answer questions.</li><li>The quizzes will be done online through the LEARN system.</li><li>There will be a limited, but a reasonably long, time window set up in LEARN during which each quiz will be available for completion. There are two attempts for each quiz available and the better attempt counts.</li><li>Quizzes that are not submitted on time will automatically receive a grade of zero.</li></ul><h4>Participation </h4><p>Participation is recommended, and it will be rewarded through bonus marks up to the total of two percentage points (2%) that will be added to the students’ final grade. Participation will be monitored through an online tool Learning Catalytics. The primary purpose of this tool in this class is to enhance the feedback mechanism between students and the instructor so that we can identify areas that may require special focus. You will be able to submit answers to in-class questions using Apple or Android smartphones and tablets, laptops, or through text message. Your participation grade will <i><strong>not</strong></i> depend on the correctness of your answers to the in-class questions. </p><h4>Learning Catalytics </h4><p>We will be using the Learning Catalytics classroom response system. Included with the purchase of a new text is a subscription to Learning Catalytics (through MyLab), which is a web-based student response system. </p><p>If you do not have a new text or code to MyLab, codes can be purchased separately through the bookstore, as it is the cheapest option - <strong>$17.25 CND for 12 months.</strong></p><p>Through the Learning Catalytics website the cost is $12 <strong>USD </strong>(6 months) or $20 <strong>USD </strong>(12 months).  </p><p>To resister please visit <a href="http://www.learningcatalytics.com">www.learningcatalytics.com</a>.  </p><p>Please reference the step-by-step login document for detailed instructions. Under the Training &amp; Support tab, you will find helpful information including technical support.  </p><h4>Midterms and Final Exam</h4><ul><li>The format for midterms and the final exam will be a mix of multiple-choice questions, numerical calculation questions, and written problems.</li><li>The final exam period for the Winter Term 2024 is April 9 - April 25 inclusive. More on the UW Final Examination policy can be found here: <a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Assignments-Tests-and-Final-Exams">http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Assignments-Tests-and-Final-Exams</a></li><li>The final exams will be scheduled by The Registrar’s Office. The default time for the completion of the final exam is any 150 minutes.</li><li>Only the Registrar’s Office can issue final grades.</li></ul><p>This grading policy will be implemented strictly for all students in the course (with the exception of verified illnesses or self-isolation due to COVID-19 – see below). </p><h4>Missing a Midterm Due to Illness During the Term</h4><ul><li>Missing a midterm will automatically result in a grade of zero for that midterm. If the illness can be documented<sup>1</sup>, with approval, you may transfer the weight of the missed midterm to the final exam. This remedy is a privilege and not a right.</li></ul><h4>Missing a Midterm Due to Self-Isolation </h4><ul><li>If the self-isolation can be documented, with approval, you may transfer the weight of the missed midterm to the final exam. This remedy is a privilege and not a right.</li></ul><p>Missing the Final Exam Due to Illness</p><ul><li>Missing the final exam is a serious matter, which automatically results in a grade of zero for the final exam and possibly a failing grade for the course. Please carefully read the Economics Department policy on deferred final exams for instructions.</li><li>Students are permitted to self-declare illness due to COVID-19 but will require a virtual Verification of Illness Form if they missed an exam due to mental health or non-covid-19 related illness.</li><li>The Undergraduate Associate Chair will determine whether a deferred exam will be granted if required.</li><li>No deferred final exam will be provided for students who missed all the exams (including the final exam) in this course</li><li>Elective arrangements (such as travel plans) are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an accommodation.</li></ul><p> </p>

However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p><h4>Economics Department Deferred Final Exam Policy</h4><p>All deferred Final Exam requests for economics courses are administered by the Economics Undergraduate Office.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests.
