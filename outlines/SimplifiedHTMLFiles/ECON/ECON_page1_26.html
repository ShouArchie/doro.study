<p>Learning in this course results primarily from lectures, in-class discussions, home readings, and practice problem sets. Students learning and progress in this course will be evaluated on individual basis.</p><p><strong>Please Note:</strong></p><ol><li>For some chapters selected portions will be covered as a part of the course material.</li><li>If a student misses a lecture for any reason, it is student’s responsibility to obtain class lecture notes and other relevant material.</li><li>There will be no make-up midterms.</li><li>If a midterm exam is missed, given proper documentation, the weight will be transferred to the final exam.</li><li>All exams, midterms and final, are individual and closed-book.</li><li>Both the in-class midterms and the final exam will consist of a mix of short answer questions, analytical problems, numerical calculations, mathematical derivations, true-false, multiple choice, and fill-in-the-blank questions, and will draw on material covered in the lectures.</li><li>It is mandatory that students bring their UW student ID card to the midterms and the final exam.</li><li>Your grades on midterms will be posted on LEARN. Please immediately report to the instructor any discrepancy between the posted and actual grades.</li><li>Only the Registrar’s Office can issue final grades. Hence, marks for the final exam will not be posted on LEARN.</li><li>Missing the final exam is a very serious matter which automatically results in a grade of zero for the final exam and possibly a failing grade for the course. Please carefully read the Economics Department policy on deferred final exams for instructions.</li><li>No deferred final exam will be provided for students who missed all the exams (including the final exam) in this course. For instructions on the deferred final exam policy please refer to the Deferred Final Exam Policy, located at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/economics/undergraduate/resources-and-policies/deferred-final-exam-policy"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/economics/undergraduate/resources</u></a>.</li><li>You are encouraged to contact course instructor or course TA for any questions on the course material and outlines, evaluation scheme, and the final exam.</li></ol><p> </p><p><strong>Communication and Feedback:</strong></p><p>I will be using LEARN to post relevant course material. Students are encouraged to contact with instructor or TA to seek help or to discuss course related matters. Instructor’s office hours are listed on page 1. If scheduled office hours conflict with your schedule, you can request an appointment with me via email (<a href="m4karimz@uwaterloo.ca">m4karimz@uwaterloo.ca</a>). Please ensure that your email has subject line starting with “ECON 206” this will minimize the risk of your email being overlooked or perceived as spam.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Guidelines and Expectations:</strong></p><p>For getting the most out of this course grade wise and in terms of learning, active participation on your behalf is essential. In order to make this journey successful, each student’s cooperation, diligence, sincerity and above all a great deal of interest and involvement in learning the course material are important. This will ensure that we receive the maximum value added from the course.</p><p>I will deliver my lectures using slides. The slides will be distributed through LEARN. I will also use the blackboard/whiteboard to cover additional material. The slides are not lecture notes. They are mainly providing outlines of what will be discussed in class. I will set the lecturing pace based on the assumption that you have copies of the slides with you in class.</p><p>Students are assumed to have read the material ahead of the lectures. Please refer to the Tentative Course Schedule on page 2 for reading schedule. Students should NOT expect me to talk about every single textbook page. The lectures will focus on the most important and challenging parts of the material. More basic material will be left for the students to study on their own. I will refer to this more basic material in the lectures, hence the need to read ahead to understand the lectures.</p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.

Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
