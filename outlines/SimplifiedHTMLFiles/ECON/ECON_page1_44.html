<p><strong>Course Materials on LEARN</strong>: I will post class announcements, problem sets, lecture notes and other course materials on LEARN. Students are responsible for staying updated with the course's LEARN page. </p><p><strong>Office Hours</strong>: Mondays 15h30-17h00. My office is located in HH131. There will be additional office hours before midterms and the final exam, and these will be announced in class and on LEARN.</p><p><strong>Email Policy</strong>: Office hours are the appropriate venue for asking questions about the material from the course. Email is an inefficient method for communicating course content, and I will not respond to detailed question about the material other than during class or office hours. Email is appropriate for matters related to course administration, like questions about missed lectures, assignment or exams. </p>

  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ECON 306:</div>
<p>This course introduces students to the analysis of inter-temporal trade-offs in macroeconomics and macroeconomic policy. Its main objective is to show how economists use economic theory to analyze the role of incentives and general equilibrium considerations in the macro-economy. Applications include national savings and investment, business cycles, and monetary and fiscal policy.</p>

<p>I will track my notes closely during lectures. However, reading through my notes is not a good substitute from coming to class and taking notes. In class I can devote more time to interpretations, and I can give additional details about derivations in response to questions. I can also present examples and other exercises in class that are not in the notes, and could end up on midterms or the final exam. Students are responsible for keeping up with the material I present both in the notes and in class. </p><p> </p>

<p>-There are <strong>four</strong> assignments, due throughout the term. The aim of assignments is to help you integrate the material from class and prepare you for the exams. Teamwork is expected (and to some degree recommended), although each student must hand in their own assignment. The assignments will consist of questions drawn for the course's problem sets, available on LEARN. The exact questions covered by the assignments will be announced on LEARN at least one week before the assignment's due date. Assignments must be submitted in the relevant dropbox on LEARN, in a single pdf file, with proper page orientation and ordering.  </p><ul><li>Assignment 1, due Friday January 24, 17h00</li><li>Assignment 2, due Friday February 28, 17h00</li><li>Assignment 3, due Friday March 21, 17h00</li><li>Assignment 4, due Friday April 4, 17h00</li></ul><p>Each assignment will be graded on a 0-1-2 basis (this will be scaled up so that each assignment is worth 2.5 points of your final grade). <strong>Late assignments will not be accepted. </strong></p><p>-In <strong>five </strong>instances during the term, I will ask an in-class participation question. Students will have 10-15 minutes to answer this question. Students will be encouraged to discuss among themselves before writing down their answers, which must be handed in at the end of that class. Each in-class participation question will be graded on a 0-1-2 basis. <strong>Each student can only hand in ONE sheet with their answer to the in-class participation question. Handing in a sheet for an absent classmate is an academic offence. </strong></p><p>-Midterm 1 will be held in class on Thursday January 30. The material covered by the midterm will be specified in class and on LEARN prior to the test. </p><p>-Midterm 2 will be held in class on Thursday March 6. The material covered by the midterm will be specified in class and on LEARN prior to the test. </p><p><strong>There is no makeup exams for missed midterms; their weight will be shifted to the final exam, after you have filed a suitable justification (see "Faculty of Arts Procedures for Declaring Absences" below). </strong></p><p><strong>The weight of any missed assignment or in-class participation question is automatically shifted to the final exam. No justification is required. </strong></p><p>-The final exam will be held during the university's exam period. This exam is cumulative. </p>

<h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p><h4>Economics Department Deferred Final Exam Policy</h4><p>All deferred Final Exam requests for economics courses are administered by the Economics Undergraduate Office. Please consult the Deferred Exam Policy at </p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/economics/undergraduate/resources-and-policies/deferred-final-exam-policy"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/economics/undergraduate/resources-and-policies/deferred-final-exam-policy</u></a> </p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors.

A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
