<h2><u>Course Requirements and Assessment</u></h2><p> </p><p>The two individual assignments in this course will each be worth <strong>20%</strong> of your final grade. The two online quizzes will be written on the dates specified below and the results will be worth <strong>15% </strong>of your final grade for each quiz.  The Term Paper Proposal will constitute <strong>5%</strong> of your final grade. Your Term Paper will be graded as <strong>25%</strong> of your final grade.</p><p>The course grade will be based on the weighted sum of the two assignments, the two online quizzes, your Term Paper proposal, and the completed Term Paper. The breakdown is as follows:</p><p> </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Assessment </strong></td><td><strong>Date of Evaluation</strong></td><td><p><strong>Weighting</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td>Online Quiz #1</td><td>February 11</td><td><p>15%</p></td></tr><tr><td>Online Quiz #2</td><td>March 28</td><td><p>15%</p></td></tr><tr><td>Assignment #1</td><td>due on February 14</td><td><p>20%</p></td></tr><tr><td>Assignment #2</td><td>due on March 31</td><td><p>20%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Proposal</p><p>Term Paper</p></td><td><p>due on January 31</p><p>due on April 4</p></td><td><p>5%</p><p>25%</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td> </td><td><p>100%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p> </p><p>Notes</p><ul><li>All quizzes and exams for the course will be conducted online via LEARN during the 24-hour window beginning at 12:01am and ending at 11:59pm on the dates listed.  Please note that all times listed are for the eastern time zone.</li><li>The format for both the online quizzes will be a potential mix of multiple-choice questions and written problems.</li><li>The final exam period will be posted on the Final Exam Schedule. Students are expected to be available during this time.

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Policy on Missed/Late Assignments and Tests</strong></p><p>Any assignment that is not submitted by the date and time at which this assignment is due will be penalized at a rate of 10% per day (up to a maximum of 5 days). If the assignment is more than 5 days late, then it will receive a grade of zero.</p><p>Any Term Paper that is submitted after the due date will be penalized at a rate of 10% per day (up to a maximum of 5 days). If the Term Paper is more than 5 days late, then it will receive a grade of zero.</p><p>No make-up attempts will be provided for the quizzes. Students who miss a quiz and do not have a relevant medical certificate will receive a mark of zero. Students with a valid medical certificate will have the weight of the relevant quiz added to their term paper weighting.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Economics Department Deferred Final Exam Policy</h4><p>All deferred Final Exam requests for economics courses are administered by the Economics Undergraduate Office. Please consult the Deferred Exam Policy at </p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/economics/undergraduate/resources-and-policies/deferred-final-exam-policy"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/economics/undergraduate/resources-and-policies/deferred-final-exam-policy</u></a> </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as research methods and in-depth policy analysis. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Declaring Absences</h4><p>For all of the following categories of absence students are responsible for getting in touch with their course instructors as soon as possible to discuss possible accommodations for the missed course component(s). The course instructor will determine how the missed work is accommodated. Absences will be accommodated according to the<a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations"> academic regulations section of the undergraduate calendar</a>. </p><p>If you are unable to complete a course component due to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#public-health"><u>self-declared COVID-related reasons</u></a> or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences"><u>a two-day short-term absence</u></a> then you should submit a self-declaration of absence through <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students"><u>Quest</u></a>.  </p><p>If your absence is due to an <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#VIF"><u>illness not pandemic-related</u></a>, then a<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#VIF"><u> UW Verification of Illness form,</u></a> completed by a health professional, must be uploaded and submitted through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other"><u>Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process.</u></a> The VIF is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness.

However, you are responsible for contacting instructors to discuss accommodation arrangements.</p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6.</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website</a> </p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

  University Policy

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
