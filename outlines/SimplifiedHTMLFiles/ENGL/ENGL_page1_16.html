<div>
<p>This course teaches students the skills they require to write in an acceptable, academic manner. We will address issues of style, argument, and the presentation of information. Above all, the course is designed to teach the practices needed to participate in written discourse in an academic environment. Frequent written exercises and participation in oral discussions will be required. We will be studying the foundations of writing, including issues of grammar, basic sentence construction, and proper citation. We will also be performing more complicated critical thinking processes, such as the construction and assessment of an essay, personal reflections, comparison of contrasting arguments, and original research. In fact, the small scale grammar and big scale composition are closely related: the foundations of writing require the ability to think critically about what you are writing, and critical thinking is significantly degraded without the ability to present your ideas in a clear and precise manner. There will also be an emphasis on assessing contemporary media artifacts, such as podcasts, social media, and YouTube videos. Ideally, this course should be more than fulfilling an English credit; it should be the development of skills valuable to both an learning-oriented career and thinking deeply about what we encounter in our everyday lives.</p>

<p><strong>Weekly Readings</strong></p><p>For most weeks, one lecture will be on issues of writing and one will involve a close study of or more videos, podcasts, or readings relating to the topic for the week. As such, students are expected to come to class prepared for discussion, and having gone through the assigned texts (In English studies, “text” can refer to anything we analyse, not just the written words!). Students are encouraged to make their own suggestions for possible texts as well; if there is a text that I think is of high enough quality, I may substitute it into the course, or suggest it for the assignments. The purpose of these texts and the subsequent discussions is to develop critical analytical skills. We're going to take the composition skills we learn in the more writing-focused class, and explore how we can apply them. Students are not only to respond to the content of the texts, but also to their structure, and how that structure supports (or fails to support) the larger piece. The readings will cover a wide variety of topics, sometimes controversial; if you feel uncomfortable discussing a particular topic in a classroom setting, please let me know, and we can talk about alternatives. Similarly, while contentious opinions are permitted and to an extent encouraged, students are instructed to remain civil, and to be aware that no hateful or abusive language will be tolerated.</p><p><br/> </p><p><strong>Participation – 15%</strong></p><p>Your participation consists of two main parts—draft posting and feedback, and participation during in-class discussion.</p><p><br/> </p><p>Part of the participation mark will be <i>participation in all three of our draft classes. </i>For these classes, you are to bring a full draft of your assignment to class (or rather, post it to the class discussion board). And by full draft, that means at least 2/3 of its prose portion length written out (and Works Cited and title page don't count towards that length), with a point form for the rest of the paper, and a Works Cited page, when relevant. You are also to read and comment on at least two other students' paper, under a format that will be discussed later. The participation mark here depends both on submitting a proper draft, and commenting in detail in your feedback. If you have some sort of emergency, exceptions are possible, but they must be granted by me in advance of the draft submission deadline.</p><p><br/> </p><p>Additionally, there will be<i> a classroom participation</i> component. Occasionally, students will be given be small assignments involving minor exercises and activities that are conducted in class. Students will not be graded on these assignments, but completion will contribute to participation mark. The participation mark will also be a measure of participation in classroom discussions. If you feel uncomfortable participating in such discussions, that’s fine—not everyone excels under the same conditions, and there are certainly circumstances where I’m not comfortable speaking in group situations either. Instead, post your response to the course discussion board online. Ideally, your course participation will be a combination of posting to the discussion board and talking in class.</p><p><br/> </p><p><strong>Attendance</strong> -- I will be keeping track of attendance for the in-person classes, and using it to gauge leeway when it comes to extensions and other such issues. Further, you can’t participate if you’re not present (unless, again, you’ve made other arrangements). If you miss more than three classes over the term, you should post to the discussion board in response to class exercises for the classes you've missed over the three. So for example, if you miss four classes, you would required to post for at least one of those four. This posting is <i>in addition </i>to any posting you want to do to boost participation, and must be done within two weeks of the missed class.</p><p><br/> </p><p>As students, you are under a lot of pressure and will not always be able to attend class; I recognize that, and would appreciate a head’s up if you can’t make it class, particularly for multiple absences or a continual lateness. If you're ill or have any reason to suspect that you might have COVID or any other illness—I hope this goes without saying, but <strong>don't come to class! </strong>Your own health comes first, and there will never be any penalty for taking the responsible choice of self-isolation. If you can't make it to an in-person class, let me know, and we'll find a way to make up for it, and get you the information you need.</p><p><br/> </p><p><strong>Assignments</strong></p><p>Further information regarding each of the four major assignments—the reflection, the comparison essay, the annotated bibliography, and the research essay—will be provided on LEARN. In essence, each one has you approach critical arguments in different ways. For the reflection, you are showing your ability to accurately interrogate your experience and present it a coherent fashion. For the comparison, you are demonstrating that you can show how two arguments differ or build on each other. For the annotated bibliography, you are compiling a set of critical perspectives around a subject. And for the research essay, you are putting all of these skills together to construct your own, unique argument. The concept behind these assignments is called <i>scaffolding</i>: like the scaffolding of a building, each assignment will give you skills that will help with the next one.</p><p><br/> </p><p><strong>Reflection essay:</strong> students provide a brief reflection on a past event that was important for their personal development.<br/><strong>Comparison Essay</strong>: Students argue some thesis based on at least one of the texts from the course.</p><p><strong>Annotated Bibliography:</strong> Students present an annotated list of sources, four academic and two non-academic, related to a topic chosen for the research essay.<br/><strong>Research Essay:</strong> Students argue a topic based in part on the readings and in part on independent research, optionally/ideally using the sources gathered in the annotated bibliography.<br/><br/> </p><p><strong>Late assignments will be deducted 2% per school day. However, I will be generous with extensions, provided they are asked for 24 hours before the assignment is due, and a draft of required length is brought (when appropriate) to peer review days. Failure to do so will result in a penalty for the associated assignment. </strong></p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Declaring absences </strong><br/>Please see the Academic Regulations section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work.</p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong><br/>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.</p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness</strong><br/>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process. Submission through the Absence Verification System, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students should not submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong><br/>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances to the Absence Verification System for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness </strong>Students can self-declare an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason </strong>Students can self-declare one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and no documentation is required. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Recording lecture</strong></p><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p><p><strong>Late Work, Missed Assignments Policy</strong></p><p>For the assignments and introductory posts, the late penalty is 2% per school day. However, I tend to be pretty generous with extensions, and with late penalties occurred because of unforeseeable circumstances—emergencies and technical difficulties included. If you ask me for an extension, I'm likely going to grant it. The catch is that you need to contact me. Contact me if you want an extension, and contact me if you want to explain a late submission. I'll contact you as well at a certain point, but the responsibility here is on your end. Again, I know you're under enormous pressure, so I will be willing to work out alternative arrangements. In general, I'd prefer if extensions are requested at least 48 hours before the final due date of an assignment.</p><p><strong><u>Academic Integrity</u>: </strong>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. [Check <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/"><u>www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/</u></a> for more information.]</p><p><br/> </p><p><strong><u>Use of Generative AI in this course</u></strong></p><p>There are still a lot of ethical and legal issues regarding generative AI that are in the process of being settled. In general, I would recommend against using it for any purpose in this class, whether that be for discussions or assignments; part of the purpose of a writing-intensive course is to help you develop the ability to draft and organize arguments on your own, and an outside tool can be detrimental to that development. If you do use any form of generative AI for any submission (including assignments, discussion posts) you need to ask me first, provide screenshots of the prompts you used and the output you received, and illustrate significant editing in crafting the output to your own original ideas. I expect to see a lot of work in editing and expanding in any AI-assisted efforts. Do not enter any text or image into a generative AI that you don't have legal authority to distribute.</p><p><br/> </p><p><strong>Mental Health Support</strong></p><p>All of us need a support system. The faculty and staff in Arts encourage students to seek out mental health support if they are needed.</p><p><br/> </p><p><strong>On campus supports</strong></p><p>For counselling (individual or group) reach out to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/students/health-and-well-being/counselling-appointments"><u>Campus Wellness and Counselling Services</u></a>.
