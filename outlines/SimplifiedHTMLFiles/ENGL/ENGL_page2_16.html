<div>ENGL 294:</div>
<p>This course introduces students to the field of humanities-based game studies. Topics may include the debate between ludological (rules-based) and narratological (story-based) approaches, procedural studies, platform and software studies, gamification, games and adaptation studies, and games as rhetorical objects.</p>

<p>Welcome to Critical Game Studies! Together we will be stepping into the world of game studies, a relatively young academic field that was founded in the late 90s early 2000s. In this course, we will explore the social elements of play and learn to read games as social texts.</p><p>What defines play or games is nebulous and often difficult to pin down, so it is not surprising that activities that qualify as a game take on many forms. However, if we are to read them as literary texts, each of these forms need to be explored, analyzed, and evaluated so that we may better understand the social and psychological acts we take part in to play them.</p><p>The first thing that needs to be understood and accepted is that games are narratives. They are stories told throughout our culture and as such require a degree of cultural literacy to be productively understood and engaged with. You will find that each time you do so your cultural literacy is further reinforcing your understanding of both games and our culture. </p><p>The second thing that needs to be understood is that games are about community. Like all forms of storytelling, when we play, we are actively engaging with one another under a set of shared rules and taking part in similar socio-cultural practices that humanity has done for millennia. </p><p>That being said, I would like this class to challenge your previous understandings of your favourite games. I would like you to challenge yourselves in how you approach the subject matter and apply the work of game studies scholars. But like a good game, I would also like this to be a rewarding experience for all of you. I hope that these new perspectives you take on will enrich your future engagement with both games and culture.</p>

<p><strong><u>Course Assignments</u> </strong></p><p>For the assignments in this course, there will be two ongoing written assignments that will become a weekly practice for us. These will amount to a Discussion Question Portfolio and a Gaming Journal of 11 entries each. Additionally, there will be a final Choose Your Own Adventure Assignment of 6-8 pages in length.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Weekly Writing Assignments:</strong></p><p><strong>Discussion Questions Portfolio</strong></p><p>Each week on Tuesday, our class will discuss a course a concept during our discussion we will investigate our own reading of the games they apply to critically. I will end of the discussion by posing a question to the class which will be responded to as a weekly writing response. These questions will differ from week to week, but you will receive them live in class, so make sure you attend. Your response should be 300 words in length, and you will submit it before the next Monday on Learn. Not every piece needs to be polished but you should be able to take pride in what you are handing in. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Gaming Journal</strong></p><p>Each Week on Thursday, you will be playing a game with your assigned play group. After this play session I ask that you make a journal entry of your experience in relation to your thoughts, feelings, ideas, or readings that we went over. This will require you to have attended class on Thursday to acquire the play experience, so make sure you attend. This entry should be 500 words in length but you may cover any niche or broad considerations you have during your play experience. Once again, you will submit it before the next Monday on Learn.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Choose Your Own Adventure Assignments:</strong></p><p>Here I provide you with a choice, you must complete at least one of the following projects as your final assignment. You can do more than one if you so choose for extra credit but at least one must be complete to the full extent of your abilities, so that it is something you would be proud to hand in.</p><p>These projects can be based on work that was revised for each discussion question submission, if you so choose. So, don’t throw anything out if you think it can be of use here. Halfway through the course, on <strong>Friday, February 14<sup>th</sup></strong>, you will submit a two-page plan detailing what you would like to do for your project, and I will check to make sure you are on the right track. More specific information will be provided in the grading contract for how the grading will work.</p><p>Each project should be <strong>6-8 pages in length, double-spaced, in Times New Roman, and 12-point font</strong>. Each will <strong>include your full name, your student number, the assignment name, the class name and number (ENGL294), the instructor’s name, and the date</strong>. A title page can be included if desired. </p><p><strong>Please feel free to use the citation style that you are most comfortable with but I expect at least three of our readings to be cited in your work. </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>The Queen of Bored, Game Design</strong></p><p>Her majesty, Queen Alexandria Battagino, has grown weary with the world of political debacles She is forced to take part in day after day. She has requested you, the developers of Her kingdom, to craft a thought provoking yet relaxing game for Her to play in her down time to take her mind off the dreary politicians’ ramble. When designing ensure that you are applying the course concepts we took up in our readings and include a document, 6-8 pages in length, detailing an explanation and breakdown of your design.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Teach the Tinker, Game Review and Analysis</strong></p><p>Tom the Tinker has a fascination with moving parts, and he is always excited to learn new game mechanics, but he never has time to do it by himself. He has commissioned you to find a worthwhile game where he can observe how the mechanics work together and craft the play experience. He is especially interested in theme, positioning, engagement, and mechanical synergy.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Trial of the Sage, Creative Essay</strong></p><p>Mephistopheles, master of arcane arts, sits up on the hill in silent meditation. It is said that they will only break their silence for those who can teaching them something new. In exchange for this gift of knowledge they will impart their wisdom unto you. They have not been an active member of society for the past 500ish years so you will have a good chance of breaking their silence with arguments involving newer games. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, will be to craft an original argument about game studies concepts from this course.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Deadlines</strong></p><p>While I do have soft deadlines in place, see the Course Timeline below, all assignments can be submitted up until a week after the final day of class at <strong>11:59 PM, Thursday, April 10<sup>th</sup>.</strong> After this point, work will not be accepted, unless there are extenuating circumstances. Just know that I will not be able to provide you feedback for any assignments submitted later than a week after the soft deadlines. This feedback might benefit your work in the final CYOA Assignment, so it is in your best interest to meet the deadlines and ask for the feedback you think will benefit you.</p><p>I would prefer you submit the assignments electronically in LEARN, but if you have been working with physical copies then I will accept physical submissions on the day of class that they are due. I will not accept submissions by email if for some reason LEARN is not working for you,<strong> but if you email me the copy, I can confirm that you did attempt to submit on time.</strong></p><p> </p><p>I believe strongly that a student should not be assessed solely based on the quality of their work. As such, I present you, my students, with this grading contract that guarantees you 75% in this course, so long as you complete your work to satisfaction, come to class on time, and show a critical reflection on your efforts. I find this the most equitable way for grading students as there are many situations in which some students might have unfair advantages over others. In cases where English is not the first language, some students might fall behind in terms of spelling or grammar but in the classes where spelling and grammar are not the learning objectives, like this one, this is an inequitable means of assessing students. If I am trying to aid my students in learning concepts that have nothing to do with prose, I do not want their attention to be focused on spelling and grammar errors but rather composing an argument or take that can be understood and that shows their learning in the course. To this end, this grading contract ensures that students will not need to worry about marks that have nothing to do with the scope of the learning objectives.</p><p>In my class, I don’t want the grade to be on your mind more than your learning. I don’t want you to be concerned with pleasing/fooling me enough to give you a good mark. I don’t want you to feel like you need to either work with me or against me to get the mark you deserve.</p><p>I do, however, want you to take risks with your writing and ideas. If the punishment for taking risks is a failure, then few students are going to be willing to take risks. I have taken risks before and received a failing grade as a result. It broke me to feel like I was being constrained to only put out work that the teacher approved of. I want to give you the opportunity to make mistakes in a consequence-free environment and encourage you so that you don’t feel the need to hide part of yourself from your teacher and peers. </p><p>For these reasons, I cannot, and will not, in good conscience fall back on the traditional grading schemes for this course. Other teachers might not take the same position as me in their classes, but in my class, I will never be responsible for giving a student a panic attack because they think they might fail the course. While you are free to make mistakes, I don’t intend for any of you to fail, so long as you take this class seriously.</p><p>To quote Asao B. Inoue in his grading contract,</p><p>So, if you’re looking to game the system, and do the least amount of work to get the highest possible course grade, this is NOT the class for you. You’ll only be frustrated, even angry. Things will seem unfair at times. But if you wish to learn and improve yourself as a writer and reader, are willing to do the work to reach those goals, accept the idea that your labor will be rewarded and not the quality of your work (although we will discuss quality and it is important to your success, but not important to your course grade), then this is the class for you. (<i>Antiracist Writing Assessment Ecologies</i> 332)</p><p>By taking on this grading contract, I hope that you will feel the freedom to develop yourself in ways that are not confined to a numerical number. As I mentioned above, the default grade for doing all the assigned work in the manner and spirit that it is asked of you will be 75%. The only ways that this will be decreased is if you are absent from class, don’t participate, or don’t complete the assignments. Below are some defining factors for qualifying your default grade.</p><ol><li><strong>Attendance/Participation.</strong> To receive your credit for attendance and participation for your default grade, you must attend a minimum of 21 out of the 24 classes we have this semester. Any absence due to a university-sponsored group activity (e.g., sporting event, band, etc.) as well as being sick or having a family emergency will not count against you. I say this but expect it to be within reason, if you miss more than three classes because of these exemptions, then additional considerations will need to be made for your participation. There will be ample opportunities to participate in each class with discussion, play groups, etc. If for some reason you don’t appear to be participating in the class, I will reach out to you to address the issue.</li><li><strong>Lateness.</strong> To receive full attendance credit, you must also be on time. Ten minutes after class has started is late. One or two times is understandable but don’t make a habit of it. Being late for more than five classes will be considered during your assessment.</li><li><strong>Respect and Co-operation.</strong> Be polite and courteous with your classmates. For the default grade, a wholehearted attempt must be made to be a co-operative classmate. Be sure to help your peers to develop themselves further as scholars, <strong>when asked for it</strong>. I have <strong>zero tolerance</strong> for any discriminatory behaviour and won’t feel bad about reporting any student who is making my classroom feel like an unsafe space. This will also be reflected in your grade when considering participation.</li><li><strong>Incomplete Assignments.</strong> An incomplete assignment is an assignment that is not done appropriately. If you are asked to do an essay between 6-8 pages and you hand in 4 or 5 pages, this would qualify as incomplete. If you are missing a Work Cited page for an essay, then that will also be considered incomplete. Regarding the weekly writing assignments, they will be considered incomplete if you do fewer than 9 of the 11 entries/discussion questions responses. Do the work to the best of your abilities but make sure that all your work is complete in accordance with something you would be proud to hand in.</li><li><strong>Missed Assignments.</strong> Any assignments that have not been handed in by <strong>11:59 PM, Thursday, April 10<sup>th</sup></strong> will be considered missed assignments. Additionally, the weekly writing assignments will be considered missed if you do fewer than 7 of the 11 entries/discussion questions responses. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, these will be grounds for a reduced grade.</li></ol><p> </p><p><strong>Lower Grades</strong></p><p>I am aiming to make sure that everyone is able to attain a grade of at least 75% and I hope no one will settle for anything less. In any case, this is the Breakdown I will be using to determine lower grades based on the above considerations. Minus considerations for participation.<strong> </strong></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Grades</strong></td><td><strong># of Absences</strong></td><td><strong># of Missed Assignments</strong></td><td><strong># of Incomplete Assignments</strong></td></tr><tr><td>&gt;75%*</td><td>3 or fewer</td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>75%</td><td>3 or fewer </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>60-74% </td><td>4</td><td>1 </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>50-59%</td><td>5</td><td>2 </td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;50% </td><td>6 </td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>*Students who were able to meet the grade requirements for the default 75% will be given the opportunity to negotiate for a higher grade (See below).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Higher Grades</strong></p><p>The default 75% grade in this course depends first and foremost on your ability to complete the work assigned to you in accordance with the above considerations. At the end of the course, I will reach out to the students who have done all the work required of them to acquire the default grade and give them the opportunity to grade themselves.</p><p>This grading I use will give you the opportunity to assign yourself the grade you think you deserve. For this, you will write a reflection of a length that you deem acceptable. In your reflection, you will consider what you have been doing throughout the course, how you were able to accomplish it, and what lessons/experiences you will be taking with you beyond the limits of the course. There are many ways that you can claim the work you did for this course was worth more than the default grade. If you want to claim that you put more hours or more effort into the work you did, feel free to do so. If you want to claim that the quality of your work was top-notch, feel free to do so. If you want to claim just how much you have improved throughout the course because of the work you did, go for it. Give yourself a percentage mark in accordance with your own evaluation.</p><p>I find this the most equitable way to administer grades above 75%, as grades of 80% or higher should be given to outstanding contributions. However, how that work is outstanding is a point of debate even among expert education scholars. If I deem work as outstanding purely on quality, then I am falling back on the normative grading schema. It is in this manner then that I allow you to make your own case for your outstanding grade. This provides you with your own autonomy in the case of your final evaluation.</p><p>Do note, I would appreciate your honesty and realistic perspective of the work you put into the course. 75% is the average mark for a typical English course and, in my experience, there are only usually a few students that get grades above 80%. I have never heard of anyone getting 100% as a final mark in an English course and marks above 90% are extremely rare. I will reserve the right to adjust the mark you give yourself if I think you have either significantly undervalued or overvalued your own work. This will be something we can discuss after the fact if you take issue with it.</p><p>By continuing to take this class and attending it, you agree to hold yourself to this contract in the manner concerning your final grade. In accordance with the contract, I will also hold myself to it, as it is written and intended. </p><p>- Giuseppe Femia</p>

<p><strong><u>Students’ Right to Their Own Language</u></strong> </p><p>In solidarity with students who wish to use African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), or another dialect of English, I pose this quote to affirm my intentions to recognize their language as an acceptable method of communication.</p><p>We affirm the students' right to their own patterns and varieties of language -- the dialects of their nurture or whatever dialects in which they find their own identity and style. Language scholars long ago denied that the myth of a standard American dialect has any validity. The claim that any one dialect is unacceptable amounts to an attempt of one social group to exert its dominance over another. Such a claim leads to false advice for speakers and writers, and immoral advice for humans. A nation proud of its diverse heritage and its cultural and racial variety will preserve its heritage of dialects. We affirm strongly that teachers must have the experiences and training that will enable them to respect diversity and uphold the right of students to their own language. -CCCC, 2972</p><p><strong><u>Sources Citation Styles</u></strong></p><p><a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/avoiding_plagiarism/guide_overview%20.html">Style Guide Overview - Purdue OWL® - Purdue University</a></p><p> </p><p><strong><u>A Word on generative AI</u></strong></p><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific writing and revision skills.
