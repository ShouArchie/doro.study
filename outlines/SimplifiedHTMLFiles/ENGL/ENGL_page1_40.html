</div>
<div>
<p>In this course you will learn about effective written, oral, and visual communication in the physical sciences. You will have the opportunity to shape these communication skills through iterative design processes that emphasize attention to your audience, the purpose of your communications, and student agency. You will work individually and collaboratively to craft messages for internal and external audiences, including scientists, government stakeholders, affected communities, or broader publics. You will learn a variety of genres such as research reports, grant proposals, conference abstracts, conference posters, public talks, blog posts, and podcasts. Overall, this course will help you enhance your capacity to conduct research and report research findings, communicate ethically, and thereby effect important change.</p>

<p>NOTE: There is no exam in this course.</p><p><strong>HOW AND WHERE TO SUBMIT WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS</strong></p><ul><li>Electronic format: Microsoft Word or PDF online through LEARN.</li><li>Paper format is acceptable but will only be graded if you physically hand it to me.</li></ul><p><strong>ASSIGNMENT FORMAT</strong></p><p>All assignments must adhere to the following format:</p><p>Filename: Lastname_Assignment # (e.g. Chan_Assignment1.docx)</p><p>Identification: Top left of first page must include: course number, name, student #, assignment #, date. See formatting below:</p><p>All assignments must adhere to the following layout: </p><p>Double-spaced</p><p>12 pt. font (Calibri or Times New Roman font)</p><p>Page numbers on the top right of each page</p><p><strong>LATE WORK, MISSED WORK, GRADE CONCERNS, EXTENSIONS ETC.</strong></p><p>Extension requests: These must be requested 48 hours in advance, and you must provide a reasonable justification. </p><p>Late Submissions: 2-point penalty per day unless the late submission is justified by medical documentation. (e.g. a grade of 15/20 will become 13/20 if handed in 1 day late.)</p><p>Late/absent for presentation: 2-point penalty per day while presentations are still being delivered. Once each presentation’s phase is complete, you will not be able to submit the presentation for grading and will receive a zero. </p><p>Missed in-class contributions: These cannot be made-up. There are many opportunities to earn these marks, but you will miss out on these if you do not come to class.</p><p>Grade challenges: You may resubmit an assignment for re-grading only if you provide a detailed letter explaining why the concepts and the criteria of the course justify a different grade. </p><p>Incomplete courses: I will not grant an “incomplete course.” All coursework is due by the final day of lectures.</p><p><strong>OTHER IMPORTANT COURSE INFORMATION:</strong></p><p> <strong>TOOLS</strong></p><p>You will need a notebook and pen/pencil for in-class writing activities. </p><p><strong>EMAIL</strong></p><p>Me: During the work week, I will answer emails within 48 hours. I will not answer email on the weekend but will work to respond in a reasonable timeframe. It is worth noting that I do not have my uwaterloo.ca email downloaded onto my phone so last-minute questions before a deadline are not advisable.</p><p>You: All email must come from your official uwaterloo.ca address. You must have a specific subject line that beings with ENGL 193 and references your query. Please use a professional salutation to greet me (i.e. ‘Dear’ or ‘Hello’), write a specific message, and sign your name. </p><p><strong>ATTENDANCE &amp; TARDINESS</strong></p><p>Attendance is crucial to your final grade because a large portion of your marks are participation-based and because our in-class activities are geared towards learning how to complete your assignments. Two absences will be granted, penalty free, but after this you will lose a point per day absent. The same rule will apply for being late to class. </p><p><strong>ELECTRONICS</strong></p><p>We are all adults in this classroom and self-regulation with regards to electronics is expected. Please put your phone away during class. Also, you will be required to write longhand and shut your laptops so be prepared for this. However, you should talk to me if this method poses a problem for you. </p><p><strong>ACCESSIBILITY</strong></p><p>Please bring accessibility concerns to AccessAbility Services, or speak with me directly and we will work together with AccessAbility Services to ensure an equitable learning experience.  https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/</p><p><strong>PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOUR</strong></p><p>Because we will be sharing work in this class, and offering one another feedback, first, and foremost, I expect decorum and respect among your peers and in the classroom at large. I also expect kindness. </p>

However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p>
