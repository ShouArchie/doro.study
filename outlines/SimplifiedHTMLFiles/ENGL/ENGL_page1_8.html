<p>In the contemporary era of expansive international economic and cultural connections now known as globalization, literature also holds an important place in the flow of global political-economic and cultural ideas and networks. The term “global literature” implies the dissemination of literature from and to countries across the globe.  Global or World literature, in the modern sense, therefore, refers to literary works that have been translated into multiple languages and circulated to an audience outside their country of origin. As new ways emerge of delivering literature to readers worldwide, literary scholars are beginning to examine the impact that these works have on global culture and the ways that cultures can, and have transformed the world, especially by offering us new insights into other forms of human experience. This course, thus, examines the ways in which modern global literatures can be an amazing instrument for analyzing globalization. Drawing from both writers and filmmakers from different regions of the world, we will examine how modern cultural producers capture the intricacies of our globalized world and how their works circulate within that world to find their own audiences. Our study of global English literatures aims to demonstrate how that genre functions as a powerful cultural tool for understanding globalization. </p>

<p><strong>Stress and Other Related Issues</strong></p><p>Life at college can get very complicated. Students sometimes feel overwhelmed, lost, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with relationship difficulties or diminished self-esteem. However, many of these issues can be effectively addressed with a little help. Student Counselling Services (SCS) helps students cope with difficult emotions and life stresses. Student Counselling Services is staffed by experienced, professional psychologists and counsellors, who are attuned to the needs of college students. The services are FREE and completely confidential. Find out more at Student Run Services: <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/</a>. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Accessibility Statement</strong></p><p>Any student needing to arrange a reasonable accommodation for a documented disability and/or medical/mental health condition should contact Student Access and Accommodation Services at 200 University Ave West, Student Life Centre, Room 1116, Waterloo, ON or visit the <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-supports/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-supports/</a>. </p><p> </p><p><strong>UWaterloo LEARN:</strong></p><p>We will be using LEARN (the online learning management system at Uwaterloo. Students should be aware that when they access the electronic components of this course, private information such as first and last names, usernames for the ISU e-mail accounts, and program affiliation may become apparent to all other students in the same course. The available information is dependent on the technology used. Continuation in this course will be deemed consent to this disclosure. If you have any questions or concerns about such disclosure, please discuss this with the course instructor. We will use ‘LEARN’ to distribute additional information about course assignments and expectations, including hand-outs and assignment guides, so you should make a point of accessing it frequently (at least twice per week) to keep up-to-date with our course. Any announcements about changes to assigned readings, office hours, or class cancellations will also be made through ‘LEARN.’ Students who are unfamiliar with the ‘Sakai’ system should familiarize themselves with it as soon as possible; if you have any questions please seek immediate assistance by calling technology support during office hours, or review the online tips and help available by visiting the Tech. Support webpage: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/learn-help/">Home | LEARN Help | University of Waterloo (uwaterloo.ca)</a>. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Important Notes and Terms of Enrolment:</strong></p><p>Please note that continuation in this course will be deemed agreement to adhere to the terms of enrolment outlined in this course outline. If you have any questions or concerns about these terms, please contact me immediately. <strong>Important Notes:</strong> </p><p> </p><p>A). <strong>Course Policies: </strong></p><p>You are expected to be cautious and polite while speaking in class. Even if you disagree with others in class, you must do so within respectable limits. Students are expected to hand in their assignments on time. Assignments will only be accepted in hard copy or through LEARN (NOT THROUGH EMAIL). Appropriate arrangements must be made for a late submission prior to the due date. Failure to do this will result in a 10% loss of the said assignment or maybe be rejected completely by the professor. <strong>Cell phones must be turned off and put away at the beginning of every class. It is important that you remember this caution! Laptops are only permitted for taking notes.</strong> For my position on the use of laptops, see Darren Rosenblum’s recent article in the <i>New York Times</i>: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/opinion/leave-your-laptops-at-the-door-to-my-classroom.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/opinion/leave-your-laptops-at-the-door-to-my-classroom.html?_r=0</a><u>. </u></p><p> </p><p><strong>b. Email Policy:</strong></p><p>For the purposes of this course, all email communication sent from students to me must originate from the student's own University of Waterloo email account. This policy protects confidentiality and confirms the identity of the student. I will delete emails that do not originate from a UWaterloo email account. Take as much care with your email communications as you do with written assignments. Be sure to write clearly and to proofread and edit your messages. Avoid abbreviations and other texting shortcuts. Please remember that in email messages, as in your verbal communication with your professor, your tone should be polite and respectful. </p><p> </p><p><strong>c</strong>. <strong>Occasional Changes</strong> </p><p>The professor and the university reserve the right to adjust segments of the course during the term. If these changes become necessary, appropriate, and timely notice will be sent out to students. It is the responsibility of students to check their email and course website to note such changes.</p><p> </p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
