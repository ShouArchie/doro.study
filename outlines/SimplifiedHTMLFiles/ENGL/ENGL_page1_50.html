<p>In this course you will learn about effective written, oral, and visual communication in the physical sciences. You will have the opportunity to shape these communication skills through iterative design processes that emphasize attention to your audience, the purpose of your communications, and student agency. You will work individually and collaboratively to craft messages for internal and external audiences, including scientists, government stakeholders, affected communities, or broader publics. You will learn a variety of genres such as research reports, grant proposals, conference abstracts, conference posters, public talks, blog posts, and podcasts. Overall, this course will help you enhance your capacity to conduct research and report research findings, communicate ethically, and thereby effect important change. </p><p> </p>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  For all major assignments:<br/>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students’ submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/ or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin® in this course.<br/><br/>

<p><strong><u>Territorial Acknowledgement</u></strong></p><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous"><u>Office of Indigenous Relations</u></a><u>.</u></p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the </p><p><a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory"><u>CAUT Guide to Acknowledging Traditional Territory</u></a></p><p><strong><u>Intellectual Property </u></strong></p><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as: </p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof); </li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint </li></ul><p>slides); </p><ul><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and </li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or used by the instructor with permission of the copyright owner). </li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository). </p><p>Permission from an instructor or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights. </p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent). </p><p><strong><u>Mental Health Support </u></strong></p><p>All of us need a support system.

Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/"><u>website</u></a><u>.</u></p><p>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo.</p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33 -- Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6.</p><p><strong><u>Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) </u></strong></p><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may not be used during class unless explicitly permitted by your instructor. Use of AI tools to complete assignments, if permitted, must be done in accordance with Policy 71. If you decide to use AI tools, keep the following in mind:</p><p>• AI tools must not be used to plagiarize. Using AI to generate text (whole or modified) that you are presenting as your own is a Policy 71 violation. If you don’t know if something you’re doing might be considered plagiarism, ask your TA, your instructor, or your librarian. Remember that “I didn’t know I was plagiarizing” is not considered a defense of plagiarism and could still result in a Policy 71 violation.</p><p>• If using AI-generated text, remember to cite like you would any other source. While attribution rules are still evolving, here are the “official-for-now” APA guidelines you should follow for this course: https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt. See also https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai/aigeneratedcontentcitation</p><p>• Be prepared to show your work! If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor to provide evidence to support the assertion that the work is yours. If through this process there remains questions about whether you’ve submitted your original work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>• Be aware that AI-generated answers may be incorrect and may not meet the requirements of the assignment. GenAI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. In addition, be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative- artificial-intelligence. </p>
