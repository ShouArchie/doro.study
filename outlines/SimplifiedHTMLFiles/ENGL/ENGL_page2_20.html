<p>This course is an introductory workshop on digital sound recording and design. We will approach digital sound design as a creative, iterative, and collaborative process. My background is in oral history-based theatre and performance. Drawing on that background, our focus of investigation will be the impulse of telling true stories in digital sound. We will consider various genres and forms to inform your creative process, including sound art, oral history, radio and documentary, podcasting, music, and film. We will explore issues and debates in sound studies and related fields through the discussion of regular readings; we will also hone our skills in class through projects and assignments. After completing this course, you will be able to conceive, research, and produce your own sound projects and situate them within the longer histories and debates within which you are working.</p>

<p><i><strong>Reflective listening essay.</strong></i></p><p>This written assignment is meant to scaffold your understanding of what might be some of the functions of genre and media in the creation and reception of sound works (see Learning Outcomes). You will be expected to reflect on your experience listening to a podcast episode or other digital audio work featuring real-life stories. You will find a list of suggested programs in LEARN to choose from. However, if you follow a podcast or know of one that catches your attention, you may also use it as a case study for your reflection. In your discussion, respond to prompt number 5 and any other three of the following prompts:</p><ol><li>Why did you choose it?</li><li>When and how did you listen to it? (conditions of reception)</li><li>Whose voices are heard, and why are they relevant to the topic at hand?</li><li>What specific moment catches your attention as a listener, and why?</li><li>In your own words, describe its overall sound design. For instance, what other sounds beyond voice are part of it, and how does the workflow feel/land on you?</li></ol><p>Feel free to use poetic or creative language. I will be looking less at your writing style and more at the depth and honesty of your personal thoughts. I Also expect you to inform your reflections with any idea taken from the mandatory readings for Week 1. A rubric in LEARN will give you a sense of how I will grade your essay. Submit via Dropbox by <strong>January 24, 2025, 5:00 p.m.</strong> I recommend you submit earlier than that. Your submission should be between <strong>750 - 1000 words.</strong></p><p><i><strong>Site-specific audio journal</strong></i></p><p>Go to a place that calls your attention or evokes any personal memory in Waterloo. Using a field recorder, record sounds that characterize that place. You may record the sounds as you walk about that site if it feels appropriate.  Later, in a quiet space (ideally a recording studio),  record a personal narrative sharing your memory evoked by the site or the emotions or reasons for being there. Speak in the first person singular and the present tense. For instance: "I am standing next to the first building where I slept when I first landed in Canada." Or, "This is the walk-in clinic where a doctor saw me when I had terrible abdominal pain and did not have a family doctor." You may write your narrative first, rehearse it and then say it loud and record it. Use some of the recorded sounds and your voice as ingredients to compose a 2-3 minute digital audio project using Audacity or the DAW of your choice. Although I will not assess your skills as a storyteller, a clear story will be a bonus. To grade your work, I am looking at the quality of your recordings, the relationship between the sounds, the place and the story, and how you mixed and edited them to engage your audience. Submit a short written statement (1-2 pages, doubled space, font Times Roman size 12) reflecting on your experience of recording and editing the material. Apply knowledge from mandatory course readings to reflect on any aspect of your creative process. Submit three files -the Audacity project file; the final (exported) audio sound file; and a word document- through OneDrive by <strong>Monday February 10, at noon. ( I will share the OneDrive folder later)</strong></p><p> </p><p><i><strong>Peer feedbacks (2)</strong></i></p><p>For the first and second projects of the term, you will offer and accept constructive feedback and produce brief analyses of your peers’ digital sound designs. A more specific brief and a rubric will be posted on LEARN in due time. </p><p><i><strong>Sound for visual</strong></i></p><p>Create a "soundtrack" for a short film clip (2 - 3 minutes long) of your choice. Most of the sounds in your soundtrack should be recorded by you. Do not use ready-made music or sound effects. You may use 'foley' sound, experimental sound, or a mix of both. You are not expected to add the sound to the video using video editing software. Submit the audio file along with a Word document in which you give a link to the short video clip (if possible) and a short statement (1-2 pages, doubled space, font Times Roman size 12) of what you intend to achieve by adding your sound to the clip. Submit three files -the Audacity project file; the final (exported) audio sound file; and a word document- through OneDrive by <strong>Monday March 10, at noon. ( I will share the OneDrive folder later)</strong></p><p><i><strong>Final audio project</strong></i></p><p>Produce a sound work that integrates technical and theoretical ideas covered in class. The genre and approach are open. Your project must be recorded and produced specifically for this course, but you are welcome to build on non-course, creative work. Along with the recording, you will submit a statement (2 pages, double spaced, font Time News Roman, size 12) detailing your intentions, recording and editing process, and connecting your project to concepts from any of the mandatory readings and concepts from the course. Submit three files -the Audacity project file; the final (exported) audio sound file; and a word document- through OneDrive. <strong>( I will share the OneDrive folder later)</strong></p><p><strong>Weekly activities and participation</strong></p><p>There will be small weekly individual and group activities. These will generally be either (1) reflective assignments in which you respond to material discussed in class; (2) a presentation; (3) technical tasks; or (4) a research task.</p><p>Participation: to achieve the highest grades for participation, you must attend all classes; show up having done the assigned readings; and actively engage in discussions and activities in ways that enhance learning for yourself and others. If for unexpected reasons you cannot attend a class, effective participation also includes communicating your absence timely and showing care for the impact of your absences or lateness on the group dynamic.</p>

In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website</a> </p><p> </p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p> </p><h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>.
