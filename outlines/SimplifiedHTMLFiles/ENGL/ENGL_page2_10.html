  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ENGL 242:</div>
<p>This course will study literature and rhetoric in dialogue with the visual arts, including potential materials such as paintings, photography, illustrations, sculpture, monuments and memorials, installation art, multimedia and digital media. Course material will draw on a variety of literary and rhetorical genres, historical periods, and forms of visual art.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Detailed Description: </strong></p><p>This course puts into relation three intimately connected yet distinct fields of study. In particular, in contemplating how literature and the visual arts make meaning, we will be focussing on how these artistic forms function rhetorically, namely how they argue and how they persuade. As you will see in our course schedule, we will work through four units of material (plus an intro to reading/interpretation), two that engage us in questions of form (in other words, questions about how texts create meaning; units 1 and 3) and two that allow us to explore the power of constructing meaning in intermedial ways (units 2 and 4). All told, through this course, you will develop a critical vocabulary and a means of assessing the rhetorical effect of literary and visual texts. Even more importantly, you will develop an understanding of the social power that the literary and visual arts can wield. </p><p>Expect our class meetings to involve a combination of lecture, discussion, and written and/or verbal tasks. This course will require your active presence and expect that you participate effectively amidst the community of learning that we will be building (though do remember there are many ways to contribute well; active/attentive listening, professionalism, and small group participation are all great ways to show your engagement, even if you tend to be quieter in full class discussions). </p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Course Schedule: </strong></p><p>We will follow this schedule as closely as possible, but occasionally one week’s topic/readings may carry over into the next week or we may face an extenuating circumstance where a class meeting must be cancelled and our readings delayed. <strong>Your responsibility is to complete your reading by the start of the class in which we are discussing it. </strong>Your best strategy would be to complete your readings for the week before Monday’s class meeting. Note too that there will be texts read/viewed and discussed in class that were not pre-assigned readings, but that will be available as part of our lecture slides. <strong> </strong></p><p>Readings marked with an * will be available exclusively via Course Reserves (see link on LEARN). The play by Clements/Leistner (Weeks 5-6) and memoir by Troeung (Weeks 7-8) ideally should be purchased so that you can take notes most effectively, but they can be accessed via library course reserves (please note that the Clements/Leistner text is available via the SJU library solely in hard copy; there is, I believe, only one copy available).</p><figure><table><thead><tr><th><p><strong>Week</strong></p></th><th><strong>Date</strong></th><th><strong>Readings</strong></th><th><strong>Important Dates</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td>Week of Jan. 6<sup>th</sup></td><td><p><strong>Orientation</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction </strong></p><p>Setting Up Our Approach: How do we read/interpret?

<p>While other editions of the Clements and Troeung books would be fine, recall that you would not be guaranteed that your page numbers are the same as what I will be referring to in class. As such, it could take you longer to find the passages referenced in our discussions. </p><p>Our other shorter required readings are to be found via <a href="https://www.reserves.uwaterloo.ca/ares/ares.dll">Course Reserves</a>. </p><p>Please note that our course requires active reading practices, meaning that you should be marking up your texts substantially – noting important themes, concepts, ideas; asking questions; etc. If you can do that kind of active reading with e-versions, then that’s great, but if you’re doubtful that you’d be an active reader while reading on a screen, I’d recommend using print copies of our two longer texts and printing the course reserves, conserving on paper as you are able, of course. (Note: if you do print all of the course reserve readings and if you are using campus printers, expect to print a total of 221 pages, which could cost approximately $22.10). </p><p>Regardless of your chosen format for your readings, I’d recommend gathering all your readings at the start of term. Make yourself a e-folder or hard-copy-folder so that you have all your course materials together and ready to go (and also so that you're not fully dependent upon the internet on the off chance that there's an outage just when you need to be consulting your readings). </p><p> </p>

<p>Please see the <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/le/content/1106691/Home">Assignment Guidelines</a> section of LEARN for information regarding these assignments. </p><p>Note too that a bonus of 2% is available for this course. See information on LEARN. </p><h4><strong>Course Policies re: Assessments:</strong></h4><h4>A Note on Ethics in Writing </h4><p>Although you may, of course, discuss your work with others, your assignments must reflect your own abilities. Remember that “study help” sites are not your friends. <strong>Your job in our course is the creation of knowledge, not the regurgitation of what others have already thought and communicated.</strong> So, do your own thinking!</p><p>Furthermore, while peer-review can (and often should) be part of any writing process, soliciting someone “to correct” or “edit” your writing is NOT allowed. There is a fine-line between peer-review and academic misconduct (peer reviewers point out potential problem spots and make suggestions that the writer can then take or discard; peer-reviewers should not do the “correcting” for the writer). If you have any questions about ethics in the preparation of assignments, please ask!</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as developing research questions, assessing rhetorical situations, interpreting literary and visual texts, and communicating in ways appropriate to audience and purpose. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, <strong>is not permitted </strong>in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Late Assignments</h4><p>Late assignments will be penalized at the rate of <strong>three percent (3%) per day</strong>, including weekends (e.g. an assignment due on Feb. 28th that is submitted on Feb. 5th is 5 days late; hence, that assignment will be penalized by 15%). </p><h4>Extensions                                                                                                                 </h4><p>All extensions must be requested <strong>by the Monday</strong> of the week of the assignment’s due date (e.g., if an assignment is due on Feb. 28th, then a request for an extension would need to be made by Monday, Feb. 24th). A request made after the Monday, will be granted only if accommodations are secured through proper processes (e.g., self-declaration of short-term absence, VIF, other relevant documentation). Remember that a request for an extension may be denied. No extension will be granted after the original due date has passed, outside of an individual having met the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">conditions for securing accommodations</a>. </p><h4>Assignment Format and Submission</h4><p>All assignments (except for the in-class assignments, if relevant) are to be submitted via LEARN using the appropriate dropbox.</p><p>Citations of sources should follow formatting guidelines as per <i>The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers</i> (9<sup>th</sup> ed.) </p><p>Specified assignment lengths are approximate and based on proper MLA formatting (1 inch margins, Times New Roman (or equivalent) 12 point font). Exceeding the page limit by up to approximately one page is completely acceptable. Not meeting suggested page or word counts is not acceptable and most often can significantly affect the quality of your assignment, hence your grade.</p><h4>Considerations/Accommodations</h4><p>Remember that the university is a professional place, so demonstrating your professionalism is essential, and that means many things in our uncertain times, including but not limited to the following: </p><ul><li>Showing your commitment to the class and missing class only when you must due to an extenuating circumstance like illness (Please remember it can be extra work for others when you ask, “<a href="https://canpoetry.library.utoronto.ca/wayman/poem5.htm">Did I Miss Anything</a>” (I’ve linked to Tom Wayman’s sardonic poem there!), so take your attendance seriously;</li><li>Taking responsibility for any necessary absence by making arrangements in a timely manner for anything that you’ve missed;</li><li>Ensuring that you understand <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">university expectations</a> and course policies regarding the pursuit of accommodations and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#:~:text=How%20do%20I%20self-declare%20an%20absence%20%28undergraduate%20students%29%3F,the%20Student%20Absence%20Declaration%20link%20on%20the%20left.">how to self-declare</a> an absence appropriately (see boiler plate re: accommodations below); </li><li>Following health and safety protocols with exactness and consistency and thereby doing your part to prevent the spread of illness. </li></ul><p>We do have various assessments that occur during our class meetings (weekly portfolio in-class activities and the 3MT presentations/discussions); our course already has some possibility of accommodation built-in to its design (e.g., you have 10 opportunities to complete 8 portfolio in-class activities; you have an ability to ask for extensions). If further accommodations are required, we will adhere to university policies (which may mean that further accommodations are possible, but it also might mean that they are not).</p><p>And one final note: Of course, I too may be impacted by illness or other extenuating circumstances. Depending upon what’s most appropriate to the situation, we would be able to catch-up on any missed lecture material in a later in-person class, meet synchronously on-line, or be able to put to use recorded narrated slide presentations.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  No assignment screening will be used in this course.<br/><br/>I do not use TurnItIn out of concerns that it stores submissions on servers outside of Canada (namely, on U.S. servers) and that it may compromise the privacy of students. In that I am taking an ethical stand in not subjecting students to these risks, I expect that students in my courses also take an ethical stand by upholding the principles of academic integrity. Any suspected case of academic misconduct will be handled through the processes specified in Policy 71.

  Administrative Policy

<h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>St. Jerome's University and the University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p><p>As the instructor of this course, I acknowledge that I am a settler scholar whose current work and other activities take place within this same territory as St. Jerome's University and the University of Waterloo. I grew up in Hamilton, Ontario, which is part of the Dish With One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabeg to share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes, and I also was nurtured by time spent on and around Rice Lake, which exists on the lands of the Michi Saagiig Anishnaabeg traditional territory covered by the Williams Treaties. I encourage you to pause over your own relationship with the lands that have nurtured you and come to know their complex histories. In your journey, you might consider partaking in various activities and events on campus wherein Indigenous ways of knowing are celebrated and shared. For instance, you might keep your eye out for upcoming events in the Faculty of Arts's <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/about/indigenous-speakers-series">Indigenous Speakers Series</a>.  </p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. </p><p>Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information">Quest</a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system. The faculty and staff in Arts encourage students to seek out mental health support if they are needed.</p><p><strong>On campus supports</strong></p><p>For counselling (individual or group) reach out to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Campus Wellness and Counselling Services.</a> Counselling Services strives to provide a secure, supportive environment for students of all orientations and backgrounds.

Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details.

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
