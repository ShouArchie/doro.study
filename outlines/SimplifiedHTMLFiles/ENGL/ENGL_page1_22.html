<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Late Work </strong></p><p>Assignments must be submitted in the appropriately labelled LEARN dropboxes by 11:59pm on the indicated submission date. Work that is submitted late will be graded with a reduction of 2% per day (including weekends). If you require an extension, and have a good reason, you are welcome to request one from the instructor. However, Activities submitted late will not be subject to deductions and will instead receive an automatic grade of zero.</p><p><strong>Statement on the Use of Generative AI</strong></p><p>The use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in this course to complete assignments is heavily discouraged, including but not limited to ChatGPT and CoPilot. ENGL 109 is designed to provide you fundamental skills in writing, communication, critical thinking, and research methods. GenAI offers shortcuts to these valuable skills that can stunt your intellectual and professional growth–like using a calculator before learning how to solve basic math problems. Moreover, the use of GenAI has negative environmental, economic, and legal impacts on our society that must be taken into account with each use. <br/><br/>If you decide to use GenAI despite the above concerns, you are expected to properly cite your usage of it with a co-author credit, in-text citations, and in your reference page. In addition, with any assignment you complete with the help of GenAI, you must also submit a 1-page (double-spaced) reflection detailing why you decided to use it, what you used it for, and what ways it was an effective/ineffective tool for the assignment. If you choose to prioritize convenience over learning, it is appropriate that you at least critically engage with what you are doing.<br/><br/>However, AI use is strictly prohibited for the In-Class Activities. These activities are marked based on attendance and effort. Visible struggles to respond to the activity prompt will not be penalized. The main thing I’m looking for is that a genuine attempt to complete the activity was made and that GenAI was not used. <br/><br/>Uncited use of GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of Policy 71 (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Uncited work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (ICAI, n.d.).<br/><br/>If the use of GenAI is suspected where not correctly cited, you may be asked to meet with your instructor to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.<br/><br/>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:<br/>     •        Student Success Office for help with skills like notetaking and time management<br/>     •        Writing and Communication Centre for assignments with writing or presentations<br/>     •        AccessAbility Services for documented accommodations<br/>     •        Library for research-based assignments</p><p><strong>Using the Class Teams</strong></p><p>The class is synced to Microsoft Teams. You are invited to post general questions about the course and assignments on Teams as the answers might be helpful for other students to see. For your group projects, Teams will be the place for you to communicate with your fellow members. Private channels will be made for each group. Teams is not intended as a means to contact the course instructor privately. I will only respond to messages over email.</p><p><strong>Email Response Policy</strong></p><p>I will try to respond to your emails as soon as I can. With that said, I will not check my inbox after 6:00pm on weekdays or on weekends. If you need to contact me about something (especially assignment related), please do not wait until the last moment.</p><p><strong>Office Hours</strong></p><p>Office hours are scheduled from 4:00-5:00pm on Wednesdays and 3:00-4:00pm on Fridays. These in-person meetings will take place inside the Games Institute (EC1). Please email me (or ask me in class) about scheduling an appointment before office hours begin, as I will have to meet you in front of the GI. If the office hour times don’t work for your schedule, you are welcome to request a meeting at an alternative time over email. </p><p><strong>Electronic Device Policy</strong></p><p>Students are welcome to use their electronic devices during class. However, students found to be distracting themselves or others during In-Class Activities, or using GenAI to complete the work, will be penalized for doing so.</p><p><strong>Attendance Policy</strong></p><p>Students are expected to attend every class of the semester, and the instructor should be notified of any expected absences before the beginning of a class. Absences for Peer Review activities will result in a 0 for the activity grade. Absences for other In-Class Activities will result in a 0.5/1.5 (33%) deduction. </p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>
