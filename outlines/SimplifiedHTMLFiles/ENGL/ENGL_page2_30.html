<div>ENGL 335:</div>
<p>Designed to assist students with an interest in developing their creative writing skills in various genres, this course consists of supervised practice, discussions of craft, and peer critiques.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>What makes a piece of writing grab your attention? What makes it stay with you long after you’ve read it? Why are others almost instantly forgettable? Through a series of creative investigations, students will explore how poems and stories affect us, looking for tools to make their own writing burrow into the reader’s skin. </p>

<p><strong>POLICY ON LATE WORK, MISSED ASSIGNMENTS, AND MAKE-UP TESTS</strong></p><p>With workshop draft submissions and workshop feedback sheets, late submissions will lose 10% per day to a maximum of 3 days. No assignments will be accepted later than this and a grade of zero will be awarded. Any arrangements for extenuating circumstances are at the discretion of the instructor. </p><p>With all other assignments, I am amenable to a one-week grace period. Further extensions are only available with advance instructor approval. </p><p><strong>ATTENDANCE POLICY</strong></p><p>Students are expected to attend<strong> all </strong>classes. If you are unable to attend class, please contact me as soon as possible, preferably before class.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of writing skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.
