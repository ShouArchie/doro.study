  Course Description

<div>
<div>
<div>ENGL 309A:</div>
<p>A study of rhetorical theories from antiquity through the Renaissance to the 18th century, with an emphasis on how these theories reflect changing attitudes towards language, society, and the self.</p>

<div>
<p>The systematic study of effective composition, argument, and persuasion—the art of rhetoric—dates back at least to the epics of Homer and flourishes today in countless academic disciplines and spheres of social life. In fact, the historical "empire" of rhetoric is so vast in historical and geographical scope that it "digests regimes, religions, and civilizations" (Roland Barthes). With this context in mind, this course introduces students to the basic concepts, issues, and controversies in the history and theory of rhetoric by analyzing selections from key texts from antiquity to the eighteenth century. After tracing out the origins and development of rhetoric in ancient Greece and Rome, the course charts the metamorphoses of the <i>ars rhetorica</i> through the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Enlightenment. In addition to demonstrating the centrality of rhetoric to a variety of academic disciplines and social fields (law, politics, philosophy, literature, feminism, and others), the course will also show that rhetoric is not merely an art of stylistic ornamentation but an inventive, critical, and multidisciplinary enterprise that continues to shape our social reality.</p>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>This course requires regular access to the Waterloo LEARN course site. Your instructor will use this site for communicating important information concerning course matters, returning graded assignments, etc. A reliable internet connection and regular checking of the course site (at least twice a week) is therefore mandatory.</p><h3>Course Policies</h3><h4>Essay Extensions and Grace Days</h4><p>Given the unique challenges of life as a university student, it may not be possible to meet all deadlines for essay assignments. For this reason, I am willing to accommodate you wherever possible. Please do strive to submit your essays on time. However, if you cannot meet the assigned deadline, I will provide a <strong>5-day grace period</strong> after the deadline during which you may hand in your essays without penalty.</p><p>Should you require more time beyond the 5-day grace period, please get in touch with me so we can negotiate a further extension. Again, I am happy to accommodate you in any way possible. If you do not get in touch with me by the end of the grace period to discuss an extension, your late essay may be subject to a penalty of <strong>2% per day</strong>.</p><p>Please note, however, that the reading responses must be submitted on time, and that the drop-box will close after the response was to be submitted.</p><h4>Collegiality</h4><p>Students are expected to be informed, attentive, and collegial.</p><h3>Intellectual Property</h3><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h3>UW Generative AI Policy</h3><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as collecting, synthesizing, and analyzing information; developing and practicing writing skills; and creative expression. Therefore, the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment, is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity, including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage.</p><p>If I suspect an essay has been written using AI, I will use AI tools to analyze the essay. </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources">Student Success Office</a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students">Writing and Communication Centre</a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students">AccessAbility Services</a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide">Library</a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h3>Mental Health Supports</h3><h4>Accommodations and Mental Health Support</h4><p>University students often experience issues that may interfere with academic success, such as stress, insomnia, illness, unforeseen life events, relationship concerns, or feelings of anxiety, hopelessness, or depression. These issues may be even more severe at this time because of the challenges posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, many of us are dealing with disabilities and other mental and physical challenges. Please know that I am committed to treating all of these issues with the utmost seriousness and will strive to accommodate you in any way possible. If you are struggling in this class or in other classes at the University of Waterloo, I strongly encourage you to get in touch with me via email so we can collaborate to find the best way to support and accommodate you.

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
