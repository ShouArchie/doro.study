<p>Traditional literary study began as the study of the literature of nations. The study of British, American, and Canadian literature attempts to define what is unique about a nation´s literary output. While this is certainly a valuable course of study, much literature does not neatly fit national boundaries or express a unified national identity because it arises from the movement of and exchange between different communities. In this course, we will study American narratives (primarily novels) that have arisen from conditions of migration and intercultural exchange. These include narratives about slavery, immigration, border conflicts, colonization, and global capitalism. We will focus on topics including the fluidity of identity, the idea of race and racial hybridity, colonialism, and intercultural exchange.</p>

<h3>Course Policies</h3><h4>Integrity</h4><p><strong>Turnitin.com:</strong> Text matching software (Turnitin®) will be used to screen assignments in this course. For details, see the University Policies section below.</p><p><strong>AI: </strong>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Failure to do so is a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71-Student Discipline</u></a>. <strong>Your instructor will advise you regarding permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI for your assignments. </strong></p><p>The Writing and Communication Center offers the following <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/Resources-AI-Overview"><u>guidelines for using AI productively and ethically</u></a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Productive</strong> means that your use of GenAI is helping you learn. It is supporting you in developing your thinking, processing, language, and writing skills. <strong>Productive use of GenAI means using it as a tool to help you as you are completing work and not as a substitute for you doing the work</strong>. Much depends on your learning stage and learning goals, since too much reliance on GenAI, even as a tool, can be unproductive for learning.</li><li><strong>Ethical</strong> means that you have permission to use GenAI and <strong>you are transparent about how and where you have used GenAI in your work through documentation and citation</strong>. You explain when you used GenAI as a tool, what it contributed to your work, and what you did with the information it provided. Citation of GenAI use is one part of this."</li></ul><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>Library</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>Copyright Advisory Committee</u></a>.</p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI.</p><h3>Assignment Specific Policies</h3><h4>Policies Regarding Late or Missing Assignments</h4><p>The following policies apply to equally to everyone. No exceptions will be made except in the case of medical or mental health emergencies that are documented by a medical or mental health professional. You are responsible for using best practices to back up your work; personal computer problems do not constitute an emergency.</p><p><strong>Discussions: </strong>Discussion posts and responses will not be accepted after the due date.</p><p><strong>Comparative Analyses: </strong>Reflection papers will receive a 3% deduction for every day late, including weekends.</p><p><strong>Essays: </strong>Essays will receive a 3% deduction for every day late, including weekends.</p><h4>Final Exam</h4><p>The final exam date and time are firm. No alternative arrangements will be made except in the case of documented medical or mental health emergencies.</p><p>No late assignments will be accepted after the last day of exams.</p><h3>Intellectual Property</h3><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student's educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner's permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA, and/or University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous"><u>Office of Indigenous Relations</u></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
