<p>This course provides an overview of Shakespeare’s works across his histories, comedies, tragedies, and romances. By reading, discussing, and performing elements of these texts, this course will provide you a deeper understanding of the way these works were perceived and performed by their original audiences, as well as provide you with the tools to better critique and examine their performance potential for our own modern audiences.</p>

<h2>Attendance Policy</h2><p>Success in the course requires consistent attendance and engaged participation; please plan to attend all classes (barring illness or emergencies). I expect you to arrive on-time, stay for the full class, and be attentive to the content we are covering and respectful of your peers and instructor during discussions. Any unexcused absence over three will incur a full letter-grade deduction (10%) on your Participation score. At 6 absences, your score will drop by 20%, etc. </p><p>Furthermore, if you have been absent from classes for two weeks or longer, whether by illness or extenuating circumstances, you MUST follow-up with your individual instructor and academic advisor to assess whether completing your classes is still viable. Until a plan has been set in motion, you will not have assignments graded. Students who miss more than 50% of classes will automatically fail the course.</p><h2>Extensions and Late Policy</h2><p>Assignments in this class are iterative – they build upon the work of earlier drafts, activities, and previous assignments. That means that you need to hand in materials by deadline to get the most out of the assignment structure and give yourself time to develop future work. <strong>In general, late work will result in 5% late penalty per day.</strong></p><p><strong>Short Extensions</strong>: I recognize, however, that many unexpected events can happen over the course of the term. To provide some flexibility during small-scale interruptions, you have five grace days that you can use on any one activity or assignment or spread them out across a number of assignments with no questions asked, and no late penalty. If you would like to use this extension, indicate in the LEARN dropbox comment field that you are using you’re a grace day extension and the number of days you would like to apply. </p><p><strong>Longer Extensions</strong>: If there are extenuating circumstances that will significantly impact your ability to continue in the class or complete work on time, please reach out to me as soon as possible so we can discuss alternate arrangements. </p><p><strong>Exceptions</strong>: There are a few exceptions to this policy: Drafts, and Peer Reviews. There are no late submissions accepted for draft material or peer review material. Other students depend on timely submissions to complete the peer review and editing process. If you do not upload a draft and complete the peer review by the associated deadlines, you will not receive marks for the draft and peer review portions. Please contact me if you have concerns or questions. </p><p><strong>Kindness is our Policy</strong>. Generally, kindness will be our default policy when it comes to instruction, late assignments, the inability to participate on an activity, and other aspects of the course.</p><p>See LEARN outline for additional information about each assignment, group-work policies, etc. </p>
</div>
<a></a>
<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4><strong>Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)</strong></h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may not be used during class unless explicitly permitted by your instructor. Use of AI tools to complete assignments, if permitted, must be done in accordance with Policy 71. If you decide to use AI tools, keep the following in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>AI tools must not be used to plagiarize.</strong> Using AI to generate text (whole or modified) that you are presenting as your own is a Policy 71 violation. If you don’t know if something you’re doing might be considered plagiarism, ask your TA, your instructor, or your librarian.  Remember that “I didn’t know I was plagiarizing” is not considered a defense of plagiarism and could still result in a Policy 71 violation.</li><li><strong>If using AI-generated text, remember to cite</strong> like you would any other source. While attribution rules are still evolving, here are the “official-for-now” APA guidelines you should follow for this course: https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt. See also https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai/aigeneratedcontentcitation</li><li><strong>Be prepared to show your work!</strong> If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor to provide evidence to support the assertion that the work is yours.  If through this process there remains questions about whether you’ve submitted your original work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</li><li>Be aware that AI-generated answers may be incorrect and may not meet the requirements of the assignment. GenAI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. In addition, be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence.</li></ul><p>Additional resources for students considering using Gen AI may be found through the UWaterloo Library.</p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system. The faculty and staff in Arts encourage students to seek out mental health support if they are needed.</p><p><strong>On campus supports</strong></p><p>For counselling (individual or group) reach out to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Campus Wellness and Counselling Services.</a> Counselling Services strives to provide a secure, supportive environment for students of all orientations and backgrounds.

<div>
<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates.

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions.
