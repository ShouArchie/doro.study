<div>
<div>ENGL 109:</div>
<p>The course will explore a variety of issues in academic writing such as style, argument, and the presentation of information. Frequent written exercises will be required.</p>

<div>
<p>English 109 is designed to get you comfortable writing in an academic context, at the university level. You will learn about different forms of academic writing, as well as the processes that great writers engage in to create their best work. You will read texts to learn more about how they were written, and thus to improve your own writing. If you can do well in this class, you should be able to do well in all of your classes, because writing is always going to be a big part of what you do, regardless of your major. Even programs like engineering, or accounting, or geography include major writing assignments, especially in upper years, in part because they recognize that careers in those fields require far more writing than students might expect. </p><p>Because we value learning as a social activity, and thus recognize that writers and readers learn from one another, much of your work in English 109 will involve different kinds of collaboration with your peers. You will learn to give helpful feedback on your peers' writing, and consider how to revise your own work based on the feedback you get in return. You will get to revise all of your writing times in response to feedback, and reflect on your strengths and challenges as you develop your skills as a writer.</p><p>We believe that this work of writing and reading rhetorically is an important process that takes place over time, so helping you develop a writing process plays an important part in this course. We will lead you through a series of activities to help you develop your major assignments, and you will receive marks for completing those activities as well as for the major assignments you submit.  </p>

<p>In every unit, there will be a series of small process activities designed to familiarize you with genre conventions and get you started on your own writing and revisions. These activities will generally be completed in discussion forums or in your PebblePad portfolio. You will receive points for these activities based on how thoroughly you complete them, and those points will be calculated into your "Writing Process Activities" grade. Doing these activities also prepares you to do well on your major assignments. The major assignments, on the other hand, are assessed mainly for the calibre of the work, not just whether or not you included various elements. Just because you got full marks on the activities does not mean you can expect full marks on the assignment.  </p><p>Success in this class depends on meeting all of the requirements, the quality of your written work, and your willingness to try new perspectives, to revise and rethink, and to take risks.</p><p>Many course pages also include activities embedded throughout the lecture content. These quick interactive elements provide opportunities to test your understanding of course concepts but are not graded. </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Standard of Work</h3><p>This is a university-level course, and you are expected to be comfortable with the mechanics of writing; that is, to understand and use proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation in order to communicate effectively. One of the course textbooks (<a href="https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/wrd/back-matter/grammar-and-style/"><i><u>The Word on College Reading and Writing</u></i></a>) includes a section to help you with these mechanics, and there are lots of other such resources available. If you need extra assistance with the basics of writing, it is your responsibility to seek help from appropriate sources.</p><p>It is expected that any writing you submit is original and completed for this course <strong>in this term</strong>. You can't reuse writing from other courses or anything you may have written for a previous attempt at this course.</p><p>ENGL 109 is a course for you to practice and sharpen <i>your own skills </i>as a thinker and a writer. Using predictive or generative AI tools to help you create assignment content not only cheats you out of the opportunity to practice a crucial skill, it also constitutes academic misconduct if you submit any portion of an AI's work as your own writing or ideas without attributing it properly. </p><h3>Rights and Responsibilities Agreement</h3><p>Every member of this course—instructors as well as students—has rights and responsibilities to ensure a pleasant and productive experience for all. We are all answerable to University policies governing ethical behaviour (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour</u></a>) and academic integrity (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71 – Student Discipline</u></a>), as well as to those outlining grievance or dispute procedures (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70"><u>Policy 70 – Student Petitions and Grievances</u></a>).</p><h3>Online Etiquette</h3><p>We want the class environment to be a positive one for everyone. Together we will create an online space that promotes mutual respect, positive discussions, the free exchange of ideas, and the productive use of time.</p><h3>Late Work</h3><p>All assignments are due at the date and time specified. However, you can have up to <strong>five (5)</strong> penalty-free extension days ("flex days") to use however you wish throughout the term <strong>for</strong> <strong>major written assignments (not writing process activities)</strong>.* You can use all five days on one assignment, spread them out over several assignment due dates, or not use any at all. Don't use these days as an excuse to procrastinate; they are intended to give you a little breathing space if you unexpectedly run up against one of life's little glitches. If you choose to use any flex days, you don’t need to ask permission or provide documentation other than a note with your submission stating how many days you are using and how many you have left. It's your responsibility to keep track of those numbers. Once you use up your flex days, late assignments will incur a deduction of 2% per day, including weekends.</p><p>Exemptions from late penalties can only be given where there are significant extenuating circumstances. In such cases, you must contact the instructor before (or immediately after) the assignment or activity deadline, providing appropriate documentation.</p><p>Check the <strong>Course Schedule</strong> for all assignment and activity due dates. </p><p><strong>All major assignments must be completed—you will fail the class if any of the major assignments is not completed and submitted. </strong>Missed major assignments will be accepted (with appropriate late penalties) until 5 days after the due date for the final project. No work will be accepted after that date.</p><p>Writing process activities may not be available to complete or submit if you miss a due date and will not earn points towards your activity grade if completed late. Peer review activities are particularly vital for your writing process. It is very important that you make the time to properly engage in the <strong>peer review workshops</strong>, posting your own drafts and providing feedback to your peers in a timely manner. In addition to impacting your assignment and activities grades, <strong>a pattern of missed or insufficient peer review activity will result in failing the course</strong> if warranted.</p><p>* <i>Major assignments</i> are worth a percentage of your grade; <i>writing process activities</i> are worth points towards your Weekly Activities grade. When you use flex days for a major assignment submission, they will also apply to the two writing process activities <i>directly associated with the submission</i>, i.e. the Revising and Reflecting activities; otherwise, all writing process activities must be completed by their scheduled due dates.</p><h3>Submitting Work</h3><p>All work must be submitted according to the submission instructions provided with the assignments. Instructors and TAs do not accept assignments by email under any circumstances.</p><p>If this isn't your first attempt at the course, make sure that you are only using the PebblePad workbook for the current semester. Any previous versions of PebblePad workbooks will not be visible to your instructor or TAs this semester.</p><p>See the "Instructions for Submitting Assignments and Activities" page each week for more detailed information on how to submit your work.</p><h3>Course Concerns</h3><p>If you are experiencing issues with the course or with the marking, you should first discuss your difficulties with your TA via email if applicable. If the issue persists or there is no TA for your course, then you should contact the course instructor via email.</p><p>Students who believe that they have been wrongfully or unjustly treated or penalized have the right to grieve; refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70"><u>Policy 70 - Student Petitions and Grievances</u></a>.</p><h3>Intellectual Property</h3><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h3>Generative AI</h3><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as generating ideas, using feedback and revising, researching, and writing prose. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>We acknowledge that we are living and working on the traditional territory of the Attawandaron (also known as Neutral), Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes ten kilometres on each side of the Grand River.</p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory"><u>CAUT Guide to Acknowledging Traditional Territory</u></a>.</p>

<div>
<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
