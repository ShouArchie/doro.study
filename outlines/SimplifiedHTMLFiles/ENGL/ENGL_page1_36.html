<p><strong>Summary of Assignments &amp; Other Course Requirements</strong></p><p>You will be given assignment sheets and rubrics for all formal writing and presentation projects. You are expected to submit the projects to the appropriate LEARN drop box on the day listed as due on your schedule. <br/><br/>Assignment sheets will explain what you are being asked to do and give you the context surrounding the assignment. Rubrics will show you how your work will be assessed and help you understand how to demonstrate your learning. In-class activities and instructions will help you construct the parts of assignments and develop the necessary skills to complete the assignments.<br/><br/><strong>Class Activity: Architectural Engineering Article Analysis; 6 – 10 minutes</strong></p><p>You will apply your learning of the Swales model of introductions from engineering documents to examine the introduction from a recent peer-reviewed article in Architectural Engineering. Then, you will work with a group to design a highly instructive presentation in which you report how and where the article applies the Swales model and synopsize the work and contributions of the article. <strong>Due: January 23</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment 1: Architectural Engineering Pitch Email</strong></p><p>You will write a cover letter e-mail message that demonstrates your specific learning of the conventions of email authoring and storage used in the engineering profession. Your objective is to communicate your suitability for a specific position with an architectural engineering company as well as your potential assets and ideas for an architectural engineering project. You will also need to convince readers that your project is worth the investment of company resources. <strong>Due: January 28</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment 2: Progress/Status Report; 2-3 pages</strong></p><p>As you are developing your project, you will complete an engineering style progress report to update your team/project lead on your progress, any setbacks, and any changes to budgets or timelines. <strong>Due: February 6</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment 3: Architectural Engineering Technical Evaluation; at least 2 pages</strong></p><p>You will research and analyse a building material, product, service, design, and/or method of construction from one or several manufacturers, producing a high-quality Technical Evaluation Report (code compliance evaluation report). This report will provide clients, design professionals, and building officials a higher level of confidence in the certified product. <br/><strong>Due: March 3</strong></p><p><strong>Assignment 5: Technical/Recommendation Report; 6 – 10 pages</strong></p><p>You will draft a technical report for internal stakeholders in the profession. Your report will summarize known information about a problem, support this description with research from credible sources, and articulate why and how the problem must be addressed. Your concepts and report must show specific research and all original work. Your idea can change and grow over the process, but your objective is to meet the emerging needs of the company and the field of architectural engineering. <br/><strong>Due: March 28 (Submit on LEARN)</strong><br/> </p><p><strong>Assignment 6: Oral Proposal Presentation to Engineers; 5 – 8 minutes</strong></p><p>As you develop your project report or proposal, you will build a presentation that explains the project to your colleagues and supervisors. You must persuade them that the project is feasible and valuable, and that the architectural engineering firm should fund your project. Your colleagues will ask questions to evaluate the feasibility and value of your project. <br/><strong>Due: March 27 through April 3</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment 7: Semester Reflection; 1 – 2 pages</strong><br/>You will create a concise report that surveys and explains the new skills and perspectives you have encountered in your previous co-ops and in this course to your employer (DrJ) and potential employers in post-graduation positions. Consider how these new skills and perspectives have influenced (and will perhaps continue to influence) your understanding of architectural engineering, engineering communication, and your role within the architectural engineering community. <br/><strong>Due: April 7</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment: Contributions</strong></p><p>Engineers work in teams to review each other’s work and suggest improvements. You will do the same. To do so, you must contribute to our common lessons in this training, and you must participate professionally, enthusiastically in all class activities. I will use rubrics to grade you for your participation in in-class activities and your responses in our lessons. You can earn contributions grades in the following ways:</p><p> </p><ol><li>Participating in class discussion</li><li>Showing professional courtesy to colleagues</li><li>Peer reviewing other students’ work</li><li>Quizzes</li><li>Helping others succeed<br/><br/> </li></ol><p><strong>Attendance</strong> <br/>This will be an interactive class, and so it is vital that you attend class consistently and that you come properly prepared. Your attendance will have a significant impact on your participation grade. If you miss a class, you will lose the marks linked with the activities performed during that class. </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Course Policies</strong><br/><strong>Equipment you need:</strong></p><p>Your note taking methods – paper/pencil, pens, laptop, etc.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Professional Behaviour:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Attendance:  </strong>every lesson specifically supports your program and career; think of your attendance like attendance at a job.</li><li><strong>Punctuality:  </strong>everyone gets delayed occasionally but try to be on time to class the same way you would for a job. If you are unavoidably late, come in quietly and minimize your disruption.</li><li><strong>Emergencies:  </strong>communicate with me as soon as possible.</li><li><strong>Electronic Devices: </strong>no headphones in class unless directed otherwise by me for class activity. All devices are to be used only for class work.</li><li><strong>E-mail:  </strong></li></ol><ul><li>All e-mails must come from your official uwaterloo.ca address. </li><li>You must have a specific subject line that begins with “ENGL 191.”</li><li>Use a professional salutation to greet me, write a specific message, and sign your name as you would complete a letter.</li><li>Expect a formal reply to your queries within twenty-four hours between Monday and Friday. But keep in mind that last-minute questions are unlikely to produce timely responses.</li></ul><p><br/><strong>Late or Missing Assignments and Incompletes</strong> <br/>You must submit and participate in all communication projects to pass the class. You will only be given an incomplete if the university approves of it.<br/><br/>In general, I will not accept late assignments, but if you need to, you may request an extension of up to 48 hours on any formal assignment. You must make such a request 48 hours before the due date; otherwise, I will not consider it. Should you need further accommodations, you should speak to me. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I cannot include peer reviews and team projects in this policy. If you miss the deadline for peer reviews or team projects, you will simply receive a zero. <br/><br/>Assignments submitted any time after stipulated deadlines will be penalized 5% per day, including weekend days.</p><p> </p><p><strong>UW Policy Regarding Illness and Missed Tests</strong></p><p>The University of Waterloo Examination Regulations (www.registrar.uwaterloo.ca/exams/ExamRegs.pdf) state that:</p><p> </p><ul><li>A medical certificate presented in support of an official petition for relief from normal academic requirements must provide all of the information requested on the “University of Waterloo Verification of Illness” form or it will not be accepted. This form can be obtained from Health Services or at uwaterloo.ca/health-services/student-medical-clinic/services/verification-illness.</li><li>If a student has a test/examination deferred due to acceptable medical evidence, he/she normally will write the test/examination at a mutually convenient time, to be determined by the course instructor. </li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>The University acknowledges that, due to the pluralistic nature of the University community, some students may on religious grounds require alternative times to write tests and examinations.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Elective arrangements (such as travel plans) are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time.</li></ul><p> </p><p><br/><strong>Additional Information</strong></p><p><br/><strong>Academic Integrity</strong></p><p>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo and its Federated University and Affiliated Colleges are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.</p><p> </p><p>All students registered in courses at UW are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offences, and to take responsibility for their actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course professor, academic advisor, or the Associate Dean. When misconduct has been found to have occurred, disciplinary penalties will be imposed under University Academic Discipline Policy and UW Policy 71 – Student Discipline.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The following are some examples of academic misconduct:</strong></p><ul><li>using work from students who have taken the class previously</li><li>using work that you have written for other classes</li><li>having someone complete part of an assignment</li><li>not signalling the author or source when you are quoting, summarising, or paraphrasing</li></ul><p><br/><br/><strong>Warning against Plagiarism with A.I.</strong></p><ul><li>A.I. tools should not be used to plagiarise. <br/><br/> </li></ul><p><strong>The following are all examples of Policy 71 violations or plagiarism:</strong></p><ul><li>Using A.I. to generate writing that you are presenting as your own</li><li>Modifying A.I.-generated answers to evade plagiarism detection</li><li>Unwittingly integrating A.I.-generated text/ideas into your own work</li><li>If you are unsure whether something you are doing might be considered plagiarism, ask your class instructor, an instructor at the Writing Centre, or a librarian.</li><li>Remember that “I didn’t know I was plagiarising” is not considered a defence of plagiarism and could still result in a Policy 71 violation.</li><li>If you use AI-generated text, be sure to cite it as you would do if you with any other source. </li><li>Rules for citing on A.I. tools are still evolving, but here are the “official-for-now” APA guidelines you should follow for this course: https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt.</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Academic Integrity website (Arts)</strong></p><p>http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/arts/ugrad/academic_responsibility.html</p><p> </p><p><strong>Academic Integrity Office (UW)</strong></p><p>http://uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/</p><p> </p><p><strong>Counselling Services</strong></p><p>Counselling Services provides support free of charge and protects your privacy.
