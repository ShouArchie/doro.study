<h4><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: THE FULL, OFFICIAL COURSE SYLLABUS WILL BE POSTED ON THE LEARN WEBSITE. THE OUTLINE WEBSITE WILL CONTAIN ONLY A BASIC/SHORT VERSION NOT KEPT UP-TO-DATE. </strong></h4><p> </p><p><strong>COURSE DESCRIPTION AND DESIGN </strong> <br/><strong>Description:</strong> Welcome to English 193! In this course, you will learn about effective professional, oral, written, and visual communication skills in the life sciences. You will have the opportunity to shape these communication skills through iterative design processes that emphasize attention to your audience, the purpose of your communications, and student agency. You will work individually and collaboratively to craft messages for internal and external audiences, including scientists, government stakeholders, affected communities, or broader publics. You will learn a variety of genres such as research reports, grant or pitch proposals, conference abstracts or posters, public talks, blog posts, or video podcasts. Overall, this course will help you enhance your capacity to conduct research and report research findings, communicate ethically, and thereby effect important change.  <br/><strong>Design:</strong> This course is synchronous, meaning that students need to attend every lecture in-person on Tuesdays and Thursdays at their section time and classroom location (see above); in other words, class attendance is mandatory. This course is also paced, meaning that content such as major assignment prompts and rubrics, assigned readings, videos, or worksheets, and other course materials will be gradually released in LEARN to ensure both a steady pace and overall cohort success. The instructor has designed this course from an active learning (i.e. student-centered) approach—while there are still traditional lectures (e.g. lessons, slides, etc), students will also participate in hands-on learning through many in class activities, discussions, workshops, and other exercises that encourage practical skill development to actively participate in their own learning process within the classroom.</p>

<p><strong>MATERIALS AND RESOURCES  </strong><br/>There is no textbook to purchase for this course. Instead, assigned readings, videos, and the like will be open access and/or uploaded to LEARN as either hyperlinks or PDFs (i.e., courtesy of ‘the usage right for library licensed content’ labelled ‘LEARN use permitted—Yes’ or as ‘fair dealing’ permits for educational purposes). There may be some costs associated with the Group Poster Presentation major assignment. Specifically, groups will need to create a research poster for the Science Communication Showcase event held on April 3 by printing it via W Print (see link: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/print-and-retail-solutions/w-print"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/print-and-retail-solutions/w-print</u></a>); W Print’s ‘academic poster printing’ option in matte costs $72 + tax or about $82, which comes to $16.40 total per member for a group of five. (At the time of writing this note, there is also a second option of printing a poster via the Waterloo Public Library—Eastside Branch, which has a large-format printer [see link: <a href="https://www.wpl.ca/services/wifi-printing-photocopying/"><u>https://www.wpl.ca/services/wifi-printing-photocopying/</u></a>]; the Eastside Branch’s ‘large-format printing’ option costs about $10–$20, which comes to $2–$4 total per member for a group of five.) Students are asked to bring their laptop or tablet and headphones to type up lecture notes and complete any activities the instructor assigns during class or for homework. Students should use only free software/templates (e.g., Canva, Google Docs, Microsoft Word, etc) to draft their original work.</p>

<p><strong>COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND ASSESSMENTS </strong><br/><strong>Requirements: </strong>A passing grade in this course is 50%. That said, students are encouraged to aim for grades at least in the B-level range (70–79%) and ultimately the A-level range (80–100%) to demonstrate either an advanced or expert proficiency level in their communication skills. Students must complete all course assessments by the specified due dates. Major assignments must be submitted online via the ‘Dropbox’ tool in LEARN (from the Course Home page in LEARN, click Submit &gt; Dropbox); rough drafts and peer review comments must be posted or uploaded in the discussion boards in LEARN (from the Course Home page in LEARN, click Connect &gt; Discussions); knowledge checks may take different forms (e.g., an online workshop, pitch proposal, quiz or reflection, etc), but can only be completed in class on the specified due dates, and must also be submitted to the dropbox in LEARN (for which the submission cutoff time is 11:59pm). To maintain academic integrity, students must submit their original work; however, the use of GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) is allowed under certain conditions (see ‘GenAI use allowed under certain conditions’ below). Students are also expected to follow discipline-appropriate style guidelines (i.e., APA or MLA) for both paper and citation formatting (e.g., the title page, in-text citations, the references page, etc). There is no midterm or final exam in this course; instead, students will be assessed through a combination of: class attendance and participation activities, knowledge checks, peer review workshops, and three major assignments. Full instructions (i.e., prompts and rubrics) for the major assignments will be posted in LEARN typically near the beginning of a unit but no later than a week prior to their respective due dates, allowing students enough preparation time (from the Course Home page in LEARN, click Content &gt; Major Assignment Prompts and Rubrics). Students are expected to complete a Course Evaluation (i.e., an anonymous, online survey about the course design and teaching) by the last day of classes this term. <strong>Assessments: </strong></p><p><strong>Class Attendance and Participation Activities (13%) - Due: Throughout the Term </strong> <br/>Class attendance is mandatory and worth 10% of your final grade; students must attend every lecture in-person, on time, and demonstrate respectful behaviour (see ‘attendance policy’ below). Again, students are asked to bring their laptop or tablet and headphones to type up lecture notes and complete any activities that the instructor assigns during class or for homework. Beyond attendance, these completion marks are also calculated through students’ timely completion or submission of all participation activities, worth (0.5% x 6) 3% of your final grade, including but not limited to: the Career Goal Statement (CGS) worksheet (due <strong>January 9</strong>), the Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) workshop (due <strong>January 30</strong>), the Speech Outline worksheet (due <strong>February 6</strong>), the Research Intro workshop (due <strong>March 4</strong>), the Group Contract worksheet (due <strong>March 6</strong>), poster printing and presentation rehearsal (due <strong>March 27</strong>), etc. Other exercises (e.g., class discussions; fill-in-the-blank worksheets; online workshops, etc) may also be assigned in class. Note that each student’s ‘class attendance and participation activities’ grade will likely be tallied at the end of term, not throughout it. The participation activities will enhance students’ ability to work well individually, as part of a group, and meet deadlines.  </p><p><strong>Knowledge Checks (3 x 2% = 6%) - Due: January 28; February 27; April 1 </strong> <br/>Toward the end of each unit, students will gauge their understanding of the course materials (e.g., lessons, readings, slides, videos, worksheets, etc) by completing a knowledge check in class on the specified due dates, and must remember to bring their laptop or tablet and headphones. While the knowledge checks may take different formats (e.g., a workshop, pitch proposal, or quiz or reflection), each is worth 2% of your final grade; the knowledge checks are to be completed in class and are designed for students to earn a perfect score on them (i.e., they are marked for completion only). To ease academic stress, the knowledge checks will be open book, meaning that students are authorized to access the course materials while working on them. The content and instructions for each knowledge check will be revealed in class on the specified due date. The knowledge checks will require students to apply or discuss what they have learned in each unit, drawing on the course materials in their answers, and completing them by the end of the class session. To prepare, students are advised to type up point-form notes during the lectures for easy reference during the knowledge checks.  </p><p><strong>Peer Review Workshops (3 x 2% = 6%) - Rough Drafts and Peer Review Comments Due: January 23; February 25; March 25 </strong> <br/>Students will actively participate in 3 peer review workshops held in class. Each peer review workshop is worth 2% of your final grade and marked for completion only (i.e., 0.5% for posting your rough draft on time; 1.5% for posting three peer review comments during the workshop). In general, students will be asked to upload the rough draft of each major assignment in the discussion board in LEARN before the start of class on the specified due dates, and then post constructive feedback (e.g., a paragraph-length reply) on at least 3 of their peers’ rough drafts after reading them (from the Course Home page in LEARN, click Connect &gt; Discussions; scroll down to your class section number [i.e., 010, 011, or 012] and then click on the peer review workshop discussion board for the unit that you are working on [i.e., # 1, # 2, or # 3]). The peer review workshops will enhance students’ ability to give, receive, and implement constructive feedback.  </p><p><strong>Mock Job Application (25%) - Unit 1 Major Assignment Due: January 30 by 11:59pm </strong> <br/>For this major assignment, students will prepare for their future career in STEM by creating a mock job application (approximately <i>10 components/pages long</i>), comprised of various job seeker documents, email templates, interview answers, and more that highlight their professional skills, experiences, and qualifications. Please create one document, single-spaced (this time only), with each of the following required components beginning on a new page: (1) title page, (2) table of contents, (3) chosen job advertisement, (4) cover letter, (5) resume, (6) application or hiring manager email template, (7) answers to three common interview questions, (8) interview follow-up email template, (9) salary negotiation email template, and (10) memo to the instructor. Note that <i>this is only a mock exercise</i>, meaning that students will not actually be applying for a real-life job and should limit the personal information that they share with the instructor and their classmates; for example, they could input a placeholder like 123-456-7890 instead of listing their real phone number. This major assignment will be graded fairly using a holistic rubric. It is imperative that students follow the instructions in the major assignment prompt closely and adhere to deadlines by uploading their rough draft in the ‘Peer Review Workshop # 1’ discussion board before the start of class on January 23 (from the Course Home page in LEARN, click Connect &gt; Discussions) and submitting their good copy, as well as any ‘process documents’ (i.e., rough work; e.g., career goal statement [CGS] worksheet, rough draft[s], etc), in PDF or Word format to the ‘Mock Job Application’ dropbox by 11:59pm on Thursday, January 30th, 2025 (from the Course Home page in LEARN, click Submit &gt; Dropbox). This major assignment will enhance students’ ability to communicate professionally, persuasively, and for a variety of audiences or contexts.  </p><p><strong>Oral Presentation Video (25%) - Unit 2 Major Assignment Due: March 4 by 11:59pm </strong> <br/>For this major assignment, students will (1) choose a STEM-related topic to conduct online research on, (2) write a speech (or a script) about it <i>tailored to a non-expert audience</i> (minimum 1,000 words in length, which equates to approximately 5 minutes of speaking time; that minimum word count excludes any title, references, appendix, or other such pages), and then (3) record a video (podcast) of themselves delivering their speech in one, continuous take (using Canva, PowerPoint, or another free software). In essence, students can choose between<i> two options</i>: either write a traditional speech and record a simple video of themselves delivering it while standing up OR write a podcast-style script and record a video of themselves sitting down that incorporates some creative elements too (e.g., free music clips, visual aids, or other engaging features). The style of writing and the type of video will depend on the option chosen; in either case, <i>the instructor must be able to see and hear the student clearly in the video recording</i>—not just audio of them speaking, but video of them as well, to evaluate body language (e.g., eye contact, hand gestures, movements, etc). To continue, full speech memorization is advised, but students should aim for partial memorization at the least (i.e., students are only authorized to glance at a copy of their written speech or script, whether on cue cards, printed out, or on their smartphone; other memory aids are unauthorized, including but not limited to: floor, laptop, or wall notes; online or physical teleprompters; etc). This major assignment will be graded fairly using a holistic rubric. It is imperative that students follow the assignment instructions closely and adhere to deadlines by uploading a rough draft of their written speech or script (not their video, which they will record a bit later) in the ‘Peer Review Workshop # 2’ discussion board before the start of class on February 25 (from the Course Home page in LEARN, click Connect &gt; Discussions) and submitting a good copy of their written speech or script in PDF or Word format <i>and</i> their video recording in MP4 or MOV format (i.e., <i>upload two files</i>), as well as any ‘process documents’ (i.e., rough work; e.g., speech outline worksheet, rough draft[s], etc), to the ‘Oral Presentation Video’ dropbox by 11:59pm on Tuesday, March 4th, 2025 (from the Course Home page in LEARN, click Submit &gt; Dropbox). Students are expected to use the ‘record video’ tool within that assignment’s dropbox in LEARN for the purpose of creating their oral presentation video; however, if a tech glitch occurs when using that ‘record video’ tool, then students may record their video using the webcam on their laptop, smartphone, or tablet instead. This major assignment will enhance students’ ability to research, cite, and produce written communications on a STEM-related topic and deliver effective oral presentations.  </p><p><strong>Group Poster Presentation (25%) - Unit 3 Major Assignment Due: April 3 in-person and by 11:59pm </strong> <br/>For this major assignment, students will (1) work as part of a small group to write a research report <i>tailored to an expert audience</i> (minimum 2,000 words in length; that word count excludes any title, references, appendix, or other such pages) on a STEM-related topic that allows them to <i>advocate for positive change</i>, (2) create and print one academic poster based on their written research report (such as by summarizing its key sections and findings), and then (3) deliver a (5–10-minute) group poster presentation together at the Science Communication Showcase event held on Thursday, April 3rd, 2025 in STC 2001 (the second floor foyer) at our regularly scheduled class time. Each group member is expected to contribute their fair share of the work; for example, if each member of a 5-person group writes 400 words, then that produces a 2,000-word research report. It is important to note that all members of a group will receive the exact same grade on this group project, unless it can be proven to the instructor that there was ‘total non-participation’ by a group member (i.e., if they do not write a section of the research report or are absent on the presentation day). This major assignment will be graded fairly using a holistic rubric. It is imperative that students follow the assignment instructions closely and adhere to deadlines by uploading their rough draft (as a group) in the ‘Peer Review Workshop # 3’ discussion board before the start of class on March 25 (from the Course Home page in LEARN, click Connect &gt; Discussions &gt; Peer Review Workshop # 3) and submitting a good copy of their group poster presentation (e.g., the written research report, a clear photo of the printed poster, etc), along with any other assignment-related files or ‘process documents’ (i.e., rough work; e.g., the completed group contract worksheet, poster layout/design sketch, rough draft[s], group evaluation forms, etc), in PDF or Word format to the ‘Group Poster Presentation’ dropbox by 11:59pm on Thursday, April 3rd, 2025 (from the Course Home page in LEARN, click Submit &gt; Dropbox &gt; Group Poster Presentation). All groups must deliver their poster presentations on time and <i>in-person</i> on Thursday, April 3rd, 2025 at the Science Communication Showcase event and then promptly <i>hand-in the printed poster to the instructor</i>. This major assignment will enhance students’ ability to research, cite, and produce written and visual communications on a STEM-related topic, work well as part of a group, and deliver effective oral presentations.</p>

<h2>
  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Notice of Recording </strong> <br/>One or more activities or assignments in this course involve recording, in partial fulfillment of the learning goals and outcomes. Students will receive notification of recording either within the Learning Management System (i.e., LEARN), through this message from the instructor written in the course syllabus, or by another means. Audio, image, text, video, etc, which has been recorded may be made available by the University to the instructor for the sole purpose of assessment (i.e., assessing the student’s oral presentation video). Recordings will be managed according to the University records classification scheme, WatClass, and will be securely destroyed when no longer needed by the University. A student’s personal information is protected in accordance with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, University policies and guidelines, and may be subject to disclosure where required by law. The University will use reasonable means to protect the security and confidentiality of the recorded information, but cannot provide a guarantee of such due to factors beyond the University’s control, such as recordings being forwarded, copied, intercepted, circulated, disclosed, or stored without the University’s knowledge or permission, or the introduction of malware into a computer system which could potentially damage or disrupt the computer, networks, and security settings. The University is not responsible for connectivity/technical difficulties or loss of data associated with a student’s hardware, software, or Internet connection. By engaging in course activities that involve recording, students are consenting to the use of their appearance, image, text/chat messaging, and voice and/or likeness in the manner and under the conditions specified herein. If a student chooses not to be recorded, this notice serves as confirmation of their understanding that they must email the instructor before the start of Unit 2 on oral communication skills to discuss the possibility of an alternate assessment. Recordings are available only to authorized individuals (i.e., the instructor) who have been directly provided the above instructions/link for their use. Review the University’s guidelines for faculty, staff, and students entering relationships with external organizations offering access to course materials for more information on obligations with respect to keeping copies of course materials.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>COURSE POLICIES: </strong></p><p><strong>Attendance Policy </strong> <br/>Class attendance is mandatory. This means that students must attend every lecture in-person, on time, and demonstrate respectful behaviour (i.e., anger, aggression, bullying, etc, toward your instructor or classmates will not be tolerated). The instructor will take attendance every class/lecture session, recording on their attendance sheet if a student is present, absent, extremely late, etc. Excessive absences from class (i.e., more than 2) will adversely impact a student’s understanding of the course material and their ‘class attendance and participation activities’ grade will then be impacted (i.e., up to 1 mark may be deducted from a student’s ‘class attendance and participation activities’ grade per absence from class beyond 2; that same mark deduction may also apply if a student is repeatedly extremely late to class). However, the instructor understands that unforeseen circumstances (e.g., appointments, co-op interviews, illness, etc) may arise, and thus each student can have up to 2 absences from class excused this term without penalty; out of courtesy, students are asked to inform the instructor of an absence via email, preferably before their class section time begins but at least on the day of. If the instructor is ill, then class that day will be cancelled, and students will be notified of said cancellation via a course announcement posted in LEARN before their class section time begins, though any homework tasks would still be in effect. If in-person class sessions are no longer possible due to a COVID-19 lockdown, then they will shift online to an asynchronous delivery mode via LEARN; here is the general UW COVID-19 information page: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/</u></a>. Students are welcome, but not required (at the time of writing this note), to wear a mask in class. The consumption of food may or may not be permitted within a specific classroom but, in general, students bringing a non-alcoholic beverage with a lid (e.g., coffee, tea, water, juice, etc) and/or a snack to class hereby understand that they are solely responsible for any clean-up of, or damage caused by, their spilled beverages or food items. If students need a washroom break during a lecture, then they may simply leave the classroom for a few minutes and quietly return. Note that Reading Week is from February 15–23 (i.e., there are no classes, office hours, email replies, etc, during that scheduled time off in the term). Our last class session is on April 3 (i.e., the Science Communication Showcase event); the last day of classes in the winter 2025 term is April 4.  </p><p><strong>Late Policy </strong> <br/>Students must complete all course assessments by the specified due dates (see the ‘extension policy’ below). Major assignments must be submitted to the dropbox in LEARN (i.e., no paper or email submissions). Major assignments submitted late may incur a penalty of 2 marks deducted (e.g., as a general example, a grade of 19/25 [76%] on a major assignment would become a 17/25 [68%] with the late penalty applied), and will only be accepted up to one week after the specified due dates (i.e., original deadlines)—except in the case of the Group Poster Presentation major assignment, for which late submissions will likely not be accepted due to its highly collaborative nature. Major assignments that are missing from the dropbox in LEARN more than <i>one week</i> after the specified due dates (i.e., original deadlines) will be graded as <i>zero</i>. Late participation activities, knowledge checks, rough drafts, peer review comments, etc, will not be accepted because many of these components are interactive or have strict deadlines.  </p><p><strong>Grading Policy </strong> <br/>Each of the three major assignments will be graded fairly using a holistic rubric. This means that, in addition to a numerical score, students will also receive an overall comment (i.e., a paragraph or more of feedback) from the instructor on each of their three major assignments that highlights its quality, including strengths and areas for improvement. If the instructor has been assigned a teaching assistant for that particular term, then major assignments will typically be marked within 2–3 weeks; however, if the instructor has not been assigned a teaching assistant for that particular term, then major assignments will typically be marked within 3–4 weeks, occasionally longer (i.e., 5 weeks). Note that the instructor will not ‘negotiate’ any grades with students because they assess the quality of your work with great care. Below is the grading system/process for University of Waterloo courses:  </p><figure><table><thead><tr><th>Assigned Letter Grades</th><th>Percentage Values</th><th>Average Calculation Values</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A+</td><td>90–100</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>85–89</td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>A-</td><td>80–84</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>B+</td><td>77–79</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>73–76</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>B-</td><td>70–72</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>C+</td><td>67–69</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>63–66</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>C-</td><td>60–62</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>D+</td><td>57–59</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>53–56</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>D-</td><td>50–52</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>F+</td><td>42–49</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>F</td><td>35–41</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>F-</td><td>0–34</td><td>32</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p> Now, here is a brief explanation of that same grading system/process, as applied to this specific course (related to communication skills proficiency) and the instructor’s use of holistic rubrics for the major assignments: </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Exceeds Expectations: A numeric grade in the 80–100% range corresponds to the A-level and indicates that the quality of the student’s work exceeds standard expectations for the major assignment. The student demonstrates excellent communication skills (i.e. expert proficiency) with only a minor amount of room for improvement.</td></tr><tr><td>Meets Expectations: A numeric grade in the 70–79% range corresponds to the B-level and indicates that the quality of the student’s work meets standard expectations for the major assignment. The student demonstrates good communication skills (i.e. advanced proficiency) with a moderate amount of room for improvement.</td></tr><tr><td>Approaches Expectations: A numeric grade in the 60–69% range corresponds to the C-level and indicates that the quality of the student’s work approaches but does not fully meet standard expectations for the major assignment. The student demonstrates adequate communication skills (i.e. intermediate proficiency) with a major amount of room for improvement.</td></tr><tr><td>Misses Expectations: A numeric grade in the 50–59% range corresponds to the D-level and indicates that the quality of the student’s work misses standard expectations for the major assignment. The student demonstrates marginal communication skills (i.e. beginner proficiency) with a massive amount of room for improvement.</td></tr><tr><td>Fail: A numeric grade in the 0–49% range corresponds to the F-level and indicates that the quality of the student’s work fails to meet the bare minimum expectations for the major assignment; for example, the student did not submit the assignment or it is largely incomplete. The student demonstrates poor communication skills (i.e. novice proficiency) with an intensely critical need for improvement.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br/>(If a rubric section is only scored out of one, two, or three marks, then it will simply be assessed as ‘pass, needs improvement, or fail.’ For example, the ‘Formatting’ section of the Mock Job Application major assignment rubric currently uses this other grading scheme.)  </p><p><strong>Extension Policy </strong> <br/>Requests for extensions must be made in writing (i.e., emailed to the instructor) at least 48 hours before<i> </i>a major assignment due date; again, extensions will not be granted for other assessment items, such as the participation activities, knowledge checks, rough drafts, peer review comments, etc. Note that extensions for the Units 1 and 2 major assignments, which are individual projects, will be much easier to administer than for the Unit 3 major assignment, which is a group project, so please think ahead. In general, the instructor is open to discussing the possibility of a short extension with you (e.g., 1–3 days of extra work time beyond the original deadline) if you email them at least 48 hours before an assessment due date. In general, extensions on the Group Poster Presentation major assignment (or beyond the last day of classes this term [i.e., April 4]) will likely not be granted. Incomplete (INC) grades will also not be granted in this course (i.e., the last day to drop a class in Quest and receive a grade of WD [‘withdrew, no credit granted’] on your transcript this term is March 21; if you need help dropping a class, then email your academic advisor). Exceptions will be considered on a case-by-case basis to ensure fairness and consistency, but there is no guarantee that a student’s circumstance will be considered extenuating/unforeseen and warrant such an accommodation. However, if a student requires an accommodation due to registration with AccessAbility Services, severe illness, etc, then see the ‘declaring absences,’ ‘accommodating religious and spiritual observances,’ and ‘note for students with disabilities’ sections below.  </p><p><strong>Electronics Policy </strong> <br/>Again, students are asked to bring their laptop or tablet and headphones to type up lecture notes and also complete any activities that the instructor assigns during class or for homework; for example, students may use their laptop or tablet to type up lecture notes, access readings, slides, videos, and worksheets in LEARN, complete knowledge checks, post in the discussion boards, conduct online research, etc. However, students are asked to use their electronic devices responsibly and respectfully, making sure that they do not disrupt the instructor or their classmates (i.e., the instructor reserves the right to request electronic devices be turned off or put away at any time, such as if repeat instances of distracting or inappropriate use occur during the lessons). This also serves as your notice that recording the lectures or otherwise capturing audio, picture, video, or other such documentation of the people in this class, including the instructor and your peers, without their prior consent is unauthorized. That said, students registered with AccessAbility Services should follow their accommodation plan, which may permit capturing course content through alternate means (e.g., taking pictures of the board). </p><p><strong>GenAI Use Allowed Under Certain Conditions </strong> <br/>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course under certain conditions with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will be discussed in this section of the course syllabus and also outlined in the major assignment instructions (i.e., prompts). Recommendations for citing GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that GenAI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of GenAI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using sizable portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a>. You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work that you submit in this class, including any supported by GenAI. <i>Below are the GenAI use conditions (i.e., the parameters) set by the instructor: </i> </p><p>What Is Allowed: In this course, students may use GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for the purposes of ‘drafting’ and ‘revising’ the three major assignments only, as specified below. To avoid academic misconduct, you must properly <i>document and cite all GenAI use</i>; for examples of proper GenAI documentation and citation, see this link: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/Resources-AI-Citing"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/Resources-AI-Citing</u></a> (check out the ‘example documentation table’ and ‘Microsoft Word Template’).  </p><p>‘Drafting:’ Brainstorm ideas, formulate research questions, generate keywords, develop a basic outline or an initial rough draft (up to 500 words total), identify relevant examples or credible outside sources, and format citations in APA or MLA style. See link: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/Resources-AI-Drafting"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/Resources-AI-Drafting</u></a>  </p><p>‘Revising:’ Suggest revisions for a rough draft, regarding its argument structure, writing clarity, logical flow, and other potential areas for improvement. See link: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/Resources-AI-Revising"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/Resources-AI-Revising</u></a>  </p><p>What Is Not Allowed: <i>In this course, students may not use GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for the purpose of ‘writing’ the three major assignment good copies for them, or completing any of the participation activities, knowledge checks, subsequent outlines or rough drafts beyond the basic/initial one, and peer review comments. </i>As well, students may not feed (e.g., copy-and-paste) the major assignment prompts and rubrics, or any other instructor- or peer-created materials, into GenAI platforms because that might infringe on intellectual property and/or privacy rights.  </p><p><i>To be clear, all major assignment good copies must reflect a substantial amount of a student’s original work (i.e., their unique ideas and words, except where properly paraphrasing or quoting credible, outside sources; e.g., their own analysis, critical thinking, and personal writing style). </i> </p><p>Unauthorized use in this course (i.e., beyond ‘drafting’ and ‘revising’ the three major assignments only, as specified above) will be considered in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity, including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility, and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.) and subject to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71—Student Discipline</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). To avoid academic misconduct, <i>students should be prepared to show the instructor their ‘process documents’ (i.e., submit their rough work; e.g., subsequent outlines or rough drafts beyond the basic/initial one, completed worksheets, typed up lecture notes, etc) to demonstrate their own learning, thought, and writing processes. </i>Students will be asked to submit their rough work, either through saved drafts or document versions, along with the good copies of their major assignments. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, then the student may be asked to meet with the instructor to provide explanations to support the submitted final material as being their original work. Through this process, if they have not sufficiently supported their final submissions (i.e., good copies), then academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. <i>Students are encouraged to reach out to the instructor via email well before the major assignment due dates if they have any questions about what is acceptable and what is not in terms of GenAI use. </i>Students are also encouraged to access campus supports if they need help with their coursework, including the:  </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like note taking and time management.  </li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations.  </li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations.  </li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>UW Library</u></a> for research-based assignments. </li></ul><p><strong>UNIVERSITY POLICIES: </strong> </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement </strong> <br/>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples.

Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33—Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Anti-Racism via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/"><u>website</u></a>.  </p><p><strong>Academic Freedom </strong> <br/><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33—Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), that “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, ‘academic freedom’ refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully, and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71 and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6.  </p><p><strong>Intellectual Property </strong> <br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, teaching assistant, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof); lecture handouts, presentation slides, and other materials prepared for the course; questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, midterm exams, final exams, etc); and work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or the teaching assistant or used by the instructor or the teaching assistant with permission of the copyright owner). Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance students’ educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, the teaching assistant, and/or the University of Waterloo for written permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository, on social media, etc). Permission from the instructor, the teaching assistant, and/or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. It is also forbidden to share the materials listed above from a previous iteration of a course with a student presently enrolled in the course unless you have the instructor’s written permission to do so. In many cases, the instructor might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without their expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights. Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).  </p><p><strong>Pronouns and Chosen or Preferred First Name </strong> <br/>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name and pronouns by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Their chosen or preferred first name and pronouns listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Their legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information"><u>Quest</u></a>. Should they choose to include their pronouns in Quest, their pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronouns are added, the field in Quest will remain blank. </p><p><strong>Cross-Listed Course (if applicable) </strong> <br/>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
