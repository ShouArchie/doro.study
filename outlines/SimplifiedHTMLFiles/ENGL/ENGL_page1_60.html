<p>This course teaches the forms of science fiction present in modern science fiction and science fiction throughout history, in literature and other media forms. The main objective of this course will be to investigate how and why sf (science fiction) functions in the ways that it does. How is sf defined (and who is doing the defining)? How has our understanding of sf changed over time? How does sf work in different medium forms? How does it reflect on contemporary social issues? What purpose does science fiction serve in our lives? In particular, we will center on three subgenres of science fiction, aliens, robots, and time travel, to examine how and why science fiction creators and science fiction fans keep returning to these ideas. This course will also push students to hone their skills regarding critical analysis and essay composition.</p>

<p>All of the assignments will be explained in greater detail as their respective due dates approach. Note all assignments are due by 11:59 pm on the Friday of the week that they are due; anything submitted after that class will count as late.</p><p><strong>Participation (10%)</strong></p><p>Your participation consists of two parts: attendance, and participation in class discussion. Participation can take multiple forms. Occasionally, students will be given be small assignments involving minor exercises and activities that are conducted in class. Students will not be graded on these assignments, but completion will contribute to participation mark. The participation mark will also be a measure of participation in classroom discussions. If you feel uncomfortable participating in such discussions, that’s fine—not everyone excels under the same conditions, and there are certainly circumstances where I’m not comfortable speaking in groups either. Likewise, you can't always be present in class, and I won't penalize you for that absence. However, it does mean you're responsible for showing that you're keeping up with class concepts and discussion. Instead, post your responses to the discussion board. (And in general, use the discussion board for posting any thoughts you didn't have a chance to voice in class.) The discussion board participation will count for less than in-class participation, and it must be done within two weeks of the original lecture. Finally, sometimes I'll ask you to bring examples of a particular kind of media to class. You'll do so by posting a link to the text to the discussion board for that lecture (the same place you'll post responses to the exercises). Providing these examples before the start of that lecture will count towards participation as well. In fact, the sooner you post the examples, the more likely I will be able to incorporate them into the lesson.</p><p><strong>Attendance </strong>-- I will be keeping track of attendance, and using it to gauge leeway when it comes to extensions and other such issues. Further, you can’t participate if you’re not present (unless, again, you’ve made other arrangements). As students, you are under a lot of pressure and will not always be able to attend; I recognize that, and would appreciate a head’s up if you can’t make it class, particularly for multiple absences or a continual lateness. </p><p>After your third absence, you must post a response to the discussion board for the classes you've missed. So for example, if you miss four classes, you should post a response to the exercise from the lecture for one of those classes. It doesn't have to be the fourth class—it could be any of the four—but it would have to be at least one, and at least one more for any absence after that point. (All lecture slides will be posted within 24 hours of the lecture.) This post must be done within two weeks of the originally missed lecture to count.</p><p> <strong>Note: </strong>Participating as above is the basic requirement of the class and if your participation is not making this standard I will check in with you and let you know how to bring them up to that standard. Stronger participation involves asking thoughtful questions, thinking deeply and writing deeply in ways that are modeled by the readings, referring to prior material in the week, bringing in contemporary examples/current events that add to understanding, and any number of actions that indicate that you are actively engaging with the material and trying to understand and learn from it. Repeated participation below the minimum standard will downgrade you participation grade accordingly. </p><p><strong>Introductory Posts (800 to 1200 words, 7.5% x 2, throughout term)</strong></p><p>Prior to Week 2, each student will sign up for two “Introductory Posts.” These posts will posted to the discussion board the day before an assigned text is due, and will “introduce” the texts to the rest of the class. The focus here should be on summarizing the texts, but also responding to them. As such, the summary portion should be around 1/3 of the post, at most. In terms of response, I'm just looking for what you found interesting about the text. This discussion should include:</p><p>a) reference specific passages, which may include direct quotations (direct quotations don't count towards the word count—don't inflate the post with quotations!) that you found interesting, and why</p><p>b) an overall assessment of what you thought about the text and its themes</p><p>c) any connections you see between the text and other texts or ideas from the course, or texts you've previously experienced (I will be looking for connections to the course!)</p><p>The post should end with two questions you think would be interesting for a class discussion. The posts are due 11:59 pm the day before the class in question—but if you'd like to submit them earlier, so I can incorporate them into the lecture sooner, that would be great. I'll be creating a post for week 1's second class, so you can get a sense how they're done.</p><h3>First Essay</h3><p>This essay will ask students to expand aliens or robots as a science fiction trope,<i> </i>drawing on the works and material discussed thus far. </p><h3>Second Essay</h3><p>This essay is the student’s chance to demonstrate what has been learned over the course of the class. Creative projects are encouraged; essentially, you have the option to write a 6-8 page paper, or construct a project with a three to four page paper that uses the project as a primary source. (Past projects have included paintings, fan fiction, short stories of up to 8 pages (double-spaced, max) game commentaries, game prototypes; be creative, but be sure to run the project by me.) Students will receive a detailed description of this assignment along with possible essay topics well in advance of the due date.</p><h3>Reflection Essay</h3><p>The reflection essay is a chance for you to show me what you've learned throughout the term. It should pursue some non-trivial argument, draw on at least three works in a major way, and generally illustrate your ability to reflect on and draw connections between the texts we've experienced, and should represent at least one text or topic per month of the course.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Use of Generative AI in this course</u></strong></p><p>There are still a lot of ethical and legal issues regarding generative AI that are in the process of being settled. In general, I would recommend against using it for any purpose in this class, whether that be for discussions or assignments; part of the purpose of a writing-intensive course is to help you develop the ability to draft and organize arguments on your own, and an outside tool can be detrimental to that development. If you do use any form of generative AI for any submission (including assignments, discussion posts) you need to ask me first, provide screenshots of the prompts you used and the output you received, and illustrate significant editing in crafting the output to your own original ideas. I expect to see a lot of work in editing and expanding in any AI-assisted efforts. Do not enter any text or image into a generative AI that you don't have legal authority to distribute.</p>

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details.

Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
