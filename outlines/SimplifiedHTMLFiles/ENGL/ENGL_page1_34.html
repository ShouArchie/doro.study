<p><strong>Course Delivery</strong></p><p>This course will be delivered in-person. You will be able to access and complete key components of the course at a week-to-week pace online. Course materials will be made available via LEARN. Content for each week will be delivered in the form of modules. Our classes will begin with a presentation to introduce each day’s topic, after which an exercise related to either the topic or the next assignment will follow. Readings will be assigned from textbook selections. Plan to have read readings complete ahead of class. In conjunction with lectures, readings, and mini-assignments, you will complete four main assignments. The main assignments in the course function as parts of a whole: the pitch, progress report, proposal, and reflection form a course-long project whose theme and structure you should consider from the start of the term. </p><p><strong>Communication with your Instructor</strong></p><p>This course is designed to develop your proficiency in the major communicative genres used in engineering. I am always available via email to answer any questions or to help clarify concepts if you need additional help. I will communicate with you regularly (i.e.: weekly) via LEARN as well as through emails to the class. Do not hesitate to contact me at any time. I am happy to hear from you and will try to respond as promptly and fully as possible. If you have a question about your assignments, it is best to ask it right away: waiting until a day or two before a due date to ask for clarification is not likely to yield promising results.</p><p><strong>Progression of Assignments</strong></p><p>Although the Engineering Proposal is not introduced until after midterm week (usually), it represents the summative assessment for the course. The proposal, in addition to being a well-conceived, clearly structured, and persuasive document, is intended to communicate <strong>an engineering idea</strong> you wish to pursue, an idea you will first present through the pitch email. Your idea should respond to an existing problem in engineering. We will discuss how to do this in our first weeks together. </p><p>Our relationship in this course is both academic (instructor and students) as well as professional (engineering supervisor and junior engineers). Your Pitch Email is the first occasion for you to propose an/your engineering idea to your supervisor (myself). Your Progress Report, which builds on your pitch email idea, is a report addressed to me that outlines the major stages of your project’s development. Your Technical Proposal should showcase both how and why your project is important and deserving of funds/resources. Your Reflection will communicate your experience in the course as well as outline the potential next steps you will take as a professional on your journey to becoming accredited engineers. Each project is connected to the others. This is meant to represent the iterative function of writing, idea production, research, and the professional cycle of communication. Begin thinking about your Technical Proposal right from the start of the course; each assignment approximates towards the completion of this major goal. </p><p><strong>Assessment &amp; Accommodation</strong></p><p>Although you will have until the very last minute of assignment deadlines to submit your work, you are encouraged to submit your work at least a day or two in advance of assignment deadlines in order to mitigate unexpected electronic interruptions. If you require an accommodation/extension due to digital restrictions, please let me know ahead of time. Late assignments will be penalized <strong>5% per day</strong> with <i>no exceptions</i> unless documentation of extenuating circumstances (medical, familial, etc.) is available. Throughout the term, I will provide detailed outlines to help you work through and produce the assignments.</p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>
