<p><strong>Participation</strong></p><p>You will be expected to participate in weekly discussion boards, posting two things you learned this week either from the readings or the lectures, along with two things you do not understand or have questions about. You will also be expected to engage with your classmates’ posts. Your posts will be graded for their <i>quality</i>, not simply for completion. Your post should not simply repeat the key concepts from the readings/lectures but demonstrate your understanding of their practical or academic applications. Your reply to others should not simply repeat or repackage their posts with an unhelpful tagline (“I like that…., I agree…), but should advance the conversation in some way. If you know the answer to one of their questions, provide that answer. If you have the same questions, further elaborate on why you are confused. This component is key to the course. You will be graded on the quality of your contributions, not simply whether you completed the required posts. Initial discussion posts are due by 11:59 pm on the Friday of that week, response posts are due by 11:59 pm on the following Monday. You will also receive a grade for your in-class performance, as you are expected to be active and engaged in classroom discussion and activities. All three elements (initial post, response post, and in-class performance) are weighted equally and will result in a single grade for that week’s participation. Since your classmates depend on your discussion posts being submitted on-time for them to respond to them, a grade of zero will be entered for any late component. </p><p><strong>Peer Review </strong></p><p>This course requires you to conduct peer review of other classmates’ work and evaluate how the peer review material helped you understand your own work. You will also need to write a 2-page reflection (~500 words) on how peer review impacted your understanding of your work and the revision process and your reflections on how your writing (or writing process) has changed throughout the term. </p><p><strong>Annotated Bibliography &amp; Article Analysis </strong></p><p>This assignment has two parts: an annotated bibliography, and a C.A.R.S. article analysis. Each section is equally weighted. </p><p><i><strong>Annotated Bibliography </strong></i></p><p><i>Please note: This assignment is the basis for other assignments. As such, you need to choose scholarly science articles you are interested in and want to work with for the rest of the term projects. </i></p><p>First, find and locate two current scholarly science articles which use the IMRaD format. These should be on topics and/or areas of science that you find interesting. The article must have been published in the last 5 years. For each article, you must also locate one non-scholarly text (newspaper article, Reddit post, which discusses that exact research. </p><p>For each of your four texts, you need to create an annotated list of references. For each text: </p><ul><li>Provide the reference of the article/text in APA format. </li><li>Below, in paragraph format, discuss the text: </li></ul><p>o Give the authority of the author and the point of view from which he/she writes. Indicate the nature of the text’s content, its scope and quality. <br/>o Point out the sources’ strengths and weaknesses.<br/>o For each scholarly text, discuss your interest in this topic and how this text relates to that interest. For the non-academic texts, discuss how this format presents this information in an interesting manner (video, newspaper, twitter discussion etc.) </p><p><i><strong>Article Analysis </strong></i></p><p>For the second half of this assignment, choose one of the two academic articles. Prepare a written analysis of the introduction of the article to show how the authors use the Swales C.A.R.S. model, and to comment on how the article has made a valuable contribution to its field. </p><ul><li>Article details: Introduce the article, detailing the title, authors, publication, and year of publication. Include number of citations (if few, connect this to the year of publication). </li><li>Structural analysis: critically <strong>examine the article’s introduction</strong>, outlining specific evidence of where and how the authors develop the components of the C.A.R.S Introduction model. </li></ul><p>o Identify why target audiences would find this relevant and why.<br/>o Demonstrate where in the text the different moves and sub-moves of the model occur.<br/> o Highlight the research that this article is specifically acting in response to and how it attempts to fill the gaps in research.<br/>o Discuss where the authors develop elements particularly well or weakly. <br/>• Evaluate contribution: Provide a concise analysis explaining this article’s contribution to the field.</p><p><strong>Grant Proposal: Crowdfunding Your Research </strong></p><p><i>Note: In this scenario, the experiment has not been run and there are no results. </i></p><p><strong>The 3MT: </strong>Create an introduction to this project in the style of a 3 Minute Thesis, talking about value of the project and why it needs to be researched. You should be sure that your presentation is the correct length (max 3 minutes), polished and practiced, and aimed at a public audience with a variety of expertise using narrative elements. Your presentation will be followed include a 2-minute Q&amp;A period. </p><p><strong>The Crowdfunding Proposal</strong>: Use the research article you chose to create a mock crowdfunding proposal in a word processor. Look at all the different components involved: the proposal, images, biography, etc. You are asking for a significant amount of money to support the team’s research goals (to run the experiment). </p><p><strong>Audience and Design Elements</strong>: Finally, write a few paragraphs on a separate page identifying your targeted sections of the general/public audience alongside your design and narrative choices. </p><p><strong>Poster Presentation (Group Assignment) </strong></p><p>Posters bring together numerous models of communication you need to learn: written communication, visual communication (particularly data), oral communication in your short explanation of your research, and even interpersonal communication as you ask and answer questions. </p><p>Choose one scientific article from your group’s papers that can be represented both orally and visually and, together, create a poster based on that research article. In addition, you will write and record a short pitch about your work. You will also write a one-page design rationale that includes a justification for your focus, your design decisions, and that explains the importance and visual significance of any graphics you include. Each group member will write reflective memos about the collaborative process (to be handed in) and will sign a Group Assignment Disclosure. </p><p>You should be sure that the text is modified to suit poster format and not directly quoting the article itself. You need to ensure it is focused on a particular issue in the research you’re summarizing, includes graphics such as related images or visual representations of data, and is polished and free of errors. </p><p>**PLEASE NOTE** Most assignments are due at 11:59 pm on their respective due dates. The Poster assignment, however, is due at 10:00 am (before class begins) on its due date. The reason is because the posters and presentations must be done in-class and so no changes are allowed to be made after our class begins. Therefore, please be sure to upload all your materials to the Dropbox on LEARN before 10:00 am. </p><p><strong>Public Understanding of Science Report </strong></p><p>Finally, you must write a report on the state of your phenomenon in science and how it was represented differently in the public sphere. This assignment will let you trace the origins of science and understand how that is translated and changed to present that information to the public. </p><p>Select your original science article OR a new article of your choice. Next, find one popular non-academic piece which discusses the findings from that science article. You can use the text from your annotated bibliography or another of your choosing. </p><p>Your assignment is to write a critical analysis report analyzing all three pieces, examining: </p><ol><li>The raw science content (that which is found in your main science article). </li><li>How the science is framed in the non-academic text (how is it referenced? What is the connection?). </li><li>The ways in which the material is modified, changed, or used to modify meaning. </li></ol><p> </p>

Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will be discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions.</p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI.</p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p><h4>Held-with courses</h4><p>Please note that a held-with course will only count in the average for the subject code under which it has been taken, unless it is cross-listed with the subject code of its’ held-with course. For example, if a CLAS/HIST held-with course is taken under the CLAS subject code then it will count only in the CLAS major average, not the HIST major average. A held-with course will also only count towards program and breadth requirements of the subject code under which it is taken, unless it is cross-listed with the subject code of its’ held-with course.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.
