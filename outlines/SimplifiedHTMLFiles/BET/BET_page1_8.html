You should come to class well prepared, which means reading assigned articles before class, completing assignments and developing answers/opinions to any discussion questions, and being willing to participate in class discussions. You are also encouraged to bring in examples, articles, questions for class discussion. </p><p>To ensure that you receive credit for in-class contribution, use your name tag in every class. Remember, it is your responsibility to demonstrate your preparedness and insight.</p><p>There are also a number of ways that you can engage with your classmates, outside of the classroom. For example, contributing comments and questions to Learn discussion topics, suggesting interesting news articles, organizing small group discussions with selected classmates, or other ways that you feel add value. Given the variety of ways you can contribute to class learning, you will have an opportunity to evaluate your contributions using the provided Class Contribution Self-Assessment forms. </p><p>Self-assessments are to be completed on the forms provided in Learn&gt;Content and submitted to the appropriate Learn dropboxes following the classes on January 29 and March 12. </p><p><u>Feedback and Comments about final group presentations:</u></p><p>The final group assignment presentations provide an opportunity for the class to see different applications of the concepts and ideas discussed in class. They also give the presenting groups the opportunity to hear from the class, with thoughts, suggestions, questions about the presentation. After the group project presentations have been submitted, they will be posted for everyone in class to see and provide feedback.</p><p>I encourage you to watch all of the presentations but for Class Contribution credit I ask that you select four of them to review. Put all four reviews in a single WORD document. For each review, provide the topic of the presentation along with your questions and comments.</p><p>Reviews will be evaluated based on your understanding of the presentations and your application of BET 320 course concepts.</p><p> </p><h4>Guest Speaker Reflection                                                                                                            5%</h4><p>On March 26, we will be inviting an entrepreneur from the community to share their story with our class and other Conrad School classes. This is a chance to hear how others are building their companies, their challenges, and tips, and an opportunity to engage with other students interested in entrepreneurship. To further encourage engagement and learning, you will be submitting a 400–500-word reflection on this session. This can include your thoughts on a topic the guest speaker touched on, something they may have said that surprised you or resonated, a connection to any of the course concepts, reflections on the readings for that week, or anything you want to talk about that is DIRECTLY related to the talk. This reflection will be marked as follows:</p><ul><li>0/5 – No reflection submitted</li><li>2.5/5 – Reflection submitted but shows little effort or suggests student was either not present or paying attention to the speaker(s)</li><li>5/5/ - Thoughtful reflection, suggesting student was paying attention and spent some time reflecting on what the speaker(s) discussed.</li></ul><p>The reflection is to be submitted to the Learn Dropbox by April 2.</p><h4>Quiz                                                                                                                                                      25%</h4><p>On February 5 there will be a 90 minute in-class quiz based on understanding and application of BET 320 course concepts. The quiz will include multiple choice and short answer questions, requiring an understanding and application of BET 320 course concepts.</p><h4>Individual Assignment                                                                                                                  25%</h4><p> </p><p><i><strong>This is an individual evaluation and you are not to discuss the questions or your answers with anyone until after the due date</strong></i>. </p><p>You may refer to readings from the class and your notes. You can also refer to other sources, but not another person. Your answers must be based on content from BET 320 readings and class discussions. <i><strong>Answers that are based on concepts not discussed in BET 320 will receive no credit.</strong></i></p><p>Submissions should be two to three pages in length, plus exhibits. </p><p>The assignment is due at the beginning of class on March 12. Reports are to be submitted to the LEARN dropbox. </p><p> </p><h4>Group Assignment                                                                                                                          25%</h4><p>In groups of three or four, you will investigate the application of BET 320 course concepts to a topic of interest to you. For example, the topic can be about the future opportunities in an industry, the future prospects for a new technology, or it can be one of the topics discussed in the course. <i>The important point is that you must answer a question about the topic, using BET 320 concepts and frameworks for your analysis. </i></p><p> Students will form their own groups.</p><p>A topic proposal is due February 12. Proposals are to be submitted to the LEARN dropbox. Only one group member needs to submit the proposal.</p><p>The only deliverable for this assignment is a narrated presentation, no longer than 10 minutes, which is due before the beginning of class on March 26. The preferred format is a narrated powerpoint presentation and/or mp4 video. The presentation should outline the topic, why it was chosen, the research that was conducted, the course concepts that were useful/relevant, and a conclusion or recommendation that answers the question you are addressing. A report is not required. </p><p> </p>

However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights and academic integrity.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.</p><p><strong>Continuity Plan - Fair Contingencies for Unforeseen Circumstances (e.g., resurgence of COVID-19): </strong>In the event of emergencies or highly unusual circumstances, the instructor will collaborate with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty. This may include modifying content delivery, course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines with due and fair notice to students. Substantial changes after the first week of classes require the approval of the Associate Dean, Undergraduate Studies.</p><p><strong>Declaring absences:</strong> [<i>undergraduate students and/or courses only</i>]  Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, students are responsible for reaching out to their instructors as soon as possible. The course instructor will determine how missed course components are accommodated. Self-declared absences (for COVID-19 and short-term absences up to 2 days) must be submitted through <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students"><u>Quest</u></a>. Absences requiring documentation (e.g., Verification of Illness Form, bereavement, etc.) are to be uploaded by completing the form on the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/"><u>VIF System</u></a>. The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services"><u>UWaterloo Verification of Illness form</u></a>, completed by a health professional, is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not send documentation to your advisor, course instructor, teaching assistant, or lab coordinator. Submission through the VIF System, once approved, will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Rescheduling Co-op Interviews: </strong>Follow the co-op process for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts"><u>rescheduling co-op interviews</u></a> for conflicts to graded assignments (e.g., midterms, tests, and final exams). Attendance at co-operative work-term employment interviews is not considered to be a valid reason to miss a test.</p>

When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
