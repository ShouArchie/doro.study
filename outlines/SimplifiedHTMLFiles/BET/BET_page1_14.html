<p><strong>In-Class Participation                                                                        </strong></p><p>Active participation in class discussions is essential to the learning process and to the success of the course. You will be graded on your individual participation including the quality of your contributions to the discussion. Absenteeism (except when due to illness) will negatively affect your contribution grade. You should come to each class well prepared, which means reading any assigned cases/articles before class, developing answers/opinions to any discussion questions, participating in class discussions, and sharing your solutions/thoughts on in-class exercises and case studies. You are also encouraged to bring in examples, articles, and questions for class discussion. </p><p>To ensure that you receive credit for in-class participation, use your name tag in every class. Remember it is your responsibility to demonstrate your preparation and insight to your instructor. While regularity of contribution to discussion will be important, quality of contribution will be more important. </p><p>As part of your participation grade, you will be asked to complete two reflective self-assessments during the semester.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Peer Feedback</strong></p><p>Collaborative learning is an important part of this class. The marketing plan presentations provide an opportunity for the class to see different applications of the concepts and ideas discussed in class. They also give the presenting groups the opportunity to hear from the class, with thoughts, suggestions, questions about the presentation. Thus, the feedback you provide is valuable both for your peers and for your own learning.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Marketing Plan </strong></p><p><strong>Working on real ventures: </strong>Throughout this course, the context for what you are learning will be a venture developing a product or service to serve a real market need. Ideally you will work in groups of 2-5, but you have the option of working individually. The important consideration is that the venture should be real and in the process of being created by one or more members of the group. The venture can be in the planning stages or already launched.</p><p><strong>Proposal Pitch                                                                                                          </strong></p><p>The proposal should provide the situational analysis of the market in which your new venture will compete and explain what gap in the market your venture will serve. Detailed instructions for the proposal will be posted. The proposal should address, among other things:</p><ul><li>A description of the existing ‘industry’</li><li>The nature of customers, their buying behaviour and the segments that exist, including those segments that are not well-served, i.e., what are the gaps in the market?</li><li>The dominant players within the ‘industry’ and their market positions</li><li>The competitive challenges within the ‘industry’</li><li>How you would position your market offering</li></ul><p>Note: the term ‘industry’ refers to the customers, competitors, suppliers, etc. that are addressing the same general need/problem that your new venture will target. The purpose of the proposal is to provide the background understanding and rationale necessary to develop your marketing plan. You should only look at the ‘industry’ that is relevant to your new venture.</p><p>Depending on the number of groups in the class, the proposal pitch will either be conducted as an in-person presentation during class time (provided that class time is sufficient for all groups to pitch) or recorded by your group and submitted via Learn.</p><p><strong>Final Pitch                                                                                                                  </strong></p><p>The pitch of your final marketing plan will consist of a short summary of the situational analysis (which you initially addressed in the proposal), a more developed marketing strategy (segment(s) to be targeted, positioning statement), and an appropriate marketing mix for the new product or service. You also need to include anticipated results over a 3-year timeframe, including market share and financial analysis (projected revenues, expenses, profits, break-even).</p><p>Depending on the number of groups in the class, the final pitch will either be conducted as an in-person presentation during class time (provided that class time is sufficient for all groups to pitch) or recorded by your group and submitted via Learn.</p><p> </p><p><strong>In-Class Assessments                                                                                                                       </strong></p><p>There will be two (2) in-class assessments (approx. 60 minutes each) based on applications of marketing concepts. You will be given a number of short case scenarios about situations and/or decisions facing new businesses and then asked to use marketing concepts discussed in the course to provide recommendations or analysis for the business.</p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.

<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
