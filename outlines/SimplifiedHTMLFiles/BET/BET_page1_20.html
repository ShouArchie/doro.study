<p>The concept of Leadership can take on different forms. BET 450 Leadership is designed to help you to discover, explore, challenge, and eventually, define your vision of leadership. </p><p>In this course, you will look within yourself and define what characteristics / features of leadership are personally relevant and meaningful to you. As you progress through your leadership journey, you will better understand your strengths and limitations and learn to appreciate that being an effective leader takes time, effort, and commitment.</p><p>This course will provide opportunities for you to expand your comfort zones, challenge your current thinking, and bring about changes that position you to be a more mindful, thoughtful, and engaged leader. We will learn about the ABCs of Leadership ... Awareness, Behaviours, and Choices and how these impact our decisions.</p><p>We will engage in a variety of learning opportunities in Leadership, Mindset, Change Leadership, Work Culture, Communication, and Team Dynamics. As we progress through each learning opportunity, we will discuss the importance of leadership that <i>engages</i>, <i>empowers,</i> and <i>enables (aka e³) </i>your colleagues.</p><p>As we bring together the ABCs, the learning opportunities, and e³, you will learn to appreciate that effective leadership is not a destination, but rather, a life-long journey that requires leaders to feed their curiosity, invest their time, and commit to life-long learning. </p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>There is no official textbook for this course. </p>

<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Define Leadership as it pertains to your personal development and align your mindset and behaviours to the characteristics / features that you deem most meaningful and valuable.

Acquire and practice new strategies and tactics that support your leadership brand; 3. Utilize the ABCs of Awareness, Behaviour, and Choice to better influence others and; 4. Apply the e³ formula of engage, empower, and enable to better position yourself and others for success.

<p><strong>Attendance:</strong></p><p>Earn marks for attendance (0.5 mark per class). If you do not attend class and provide advance notice (eg email) for the absence (0.25 mark per class). If you do not attend class, own the decision (0 mark per class).</p><p><strong>Participation:</strong></p><p>Practice makes progress. The goal is to take your classroom learnings and develop new habits and behaviours. If you do not make a commitment to invest in yourself through participation (in class and take-home activity), then own the decision. Meaningful in-class participation is 0.5 mark per class. Be honest with yourself and ask ‘Did my contribution actually add value to the discussion?’</p><p><strong>Take-Home Activity:</strong></p><p>At the end of each class you will be assigned a Take-Home activity that you should perform during the week. The goal is to help you take the learnings from the class into your daily lives outside of the classroom. Through action and repetition, you will hopefully be able to develop new habits that will help you grow as a leader. The completion of the Take-Home Assignment is 0.5 mark per class. </p><p>The Take-Home Assignments will start from the second class and finish on the tenth / eleventh class. Sharing your experiences is a key learning opportunity as students will share their successes, challenges, and surprises with one another.</p><p>Remember … as a leader you will need to be able to connect with your peers, so use this as an opportunity to develop a needed skill.</p><p><strong>Self-Evaluation:</strong></p><p>Students will submit a paper describing their progress in the course. Details on the 'what' and 'how' will be provided in late February early March. <i><strong>The Self-Evaluation will be due on Wed Mar 26, 2025.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Team Project:</strong></p><p>Students will be assigned into groups starting the 2nd/ 3rd class. Team projects will be presented during the classes of Mar 13 &amp; 20. Please note that these are tentative dates. Team Presentations represent 15% of your final grade.</p><p><strong>Guest Speaker:</strong></p><p>TBD.</p><p><strong>Team Member Evaluations:</strong></p><p>Providing feedback that is constructive and helpful is a useful skill in developing trust between colleagues.</p><p>Receiving feedback from your peers can help to develop your level of personal awareness on how you impact others and your work environment. </p><p>When you are assigned to a team, you will provide feedback on the behaviours of your fellow colleagues. This activity is meant to be twofold: 1) Learn how to provide meaningful feedback, and 2) Learn how to accept constructive and meaningful feedback.</p><p><i><strong>Your Team Member Evaluations are due a day after your team presentation.</strong></i></p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. If you have concerns with this, please email me by the end of lesson 3. This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods (e.g., Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot) to produce content (e.g., text, images) is not permitted in this course. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI 8 or using GenAI to complete a course assessment, is considered a violation of Policy 71 (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (ICAI, n.d.). You should be prepared to show your work.<br/>To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generativeartificial-intelligence<br/>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
