<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>BET 580:</div>
<p>This course is useful for anyone considering working as a consultant, either for a consulting firm, as an independent entrepreneurial consultant, or as an internal consultant to large organizations. Some of the competencies skilled consultants have include understanding business needs from a holistic perspective, developing innovative ideas, expert people skills, influence, and change management. Course topics may also include key stages in the consulting process, issue diagnosis, managing difficult clients, consulting frameworks, analytical approaches to solving complex problems, engagement management, building a consulting toolset, change management processes, negotiation, and advanced presentation techniques. We will also cover aspects of the business of consulting.</p>

<p>Consulting is about helping businesses turn ideas into opportunities. It involves solving poorly-defined problems and changing people’s behaviour without any formal authority or a pre-existing roadmap.  Every consulting engagement is different and requires “learning by doing”, excellent teamwork, sticking to tight deadlines and developing trusted relationships with a wide variety of stakeholders.  </p><p>The knowledge you develop in this course will be critical if you become a consultant for a traditional management consulting firm, a business analyst at a technology firm, an independent consultant, or an “internal consultant” in a large company.  But it will also be valuable if you ever need to lead an internal project at your future employer where you are called upon to analyze a problem, assemble stakeholders, develop a solution and influence your company’s management – all without formal direct authority.  </p><p>Consulting to management can take on many forms from the classic “strategy consulting” to business process, human resources and financial consulting.  This course will introduce you to all of these forms at a high level, with a focus on the common approaches and methods used by all management consultants.  Specifically, it will cover three themes:</p><ul><li><strong>Thinking </strong>like a consultant: Identifying and structuring business problems, researching possible causes and solutions, interviewing and group facilitation, common analysis methodologies, and business innovation.</li><li><strong>Executing</strong> like a consultant: Scoping and managing projects, contracting with clients, project management, client relationships, making presentations and effective client meetings.</li><li><strong>Being </strong>a consultant: Understanding the industry, consulting as a career, professional ethics and managing a consulting practice.</li></ul><p>Like consulting itself, this course will be highly interactive, involving group work and class discussions.  In general, one half of each class will be used to discuss concepts and the other half will be dedicated to discussions, guest speakers or group exercises.  There are no exams, but you will find that the individual and group project work will be moderately challenging.  In addition, each week will involve about 2 hours of pre-reading.</p>

<p><strong><u>Individual Grades</u></strong></p><p><strong><u>Course Engagement</u></strong></p><p><strong>Class Participation (8%)</strong></p><p>There is a lot of teamwork and class discussion in this course.  Participation is not about quantity, but about the quality of your thinking, your respect for the ideas of others, and your willingness to explore new ways of thinking and doing.  Expect to be randomly “cold called” on occasion, so please read the cases. 5% of your final grade will be based on your interactions during class and office hours. </p><p><strong>Quizzes (15%)</strong></p><p>There isn’t a ton of reading in this course (about 3 hours per week).  This is usually comprised of some textbook readings and a fictitious (and often pretty entertaining) “case study” featuring a consulting situation.  We’ll talk about each case study in detail during class.  But to help you stay on top of the <i>textbook</i> readings there will be eight (8) 20-30 minute <i>timed,</i> <i>open-book</i>, <i>multiple choice</i> quizzes delivered on Learn.  Each quiz opens at <strong><u>noon on class days</u></strong> and <strong><u>close at 6:00pm</u></strong> (i.e., before the beginning of class).  Your bottom 2 scores will be dropped from the calculation of your final grade.  So, you are only required to do six (6) of them.   </p><p><strong><u>Business Problem Analysis (20%)</u></strong></p><p>One of the core skills for many consultants is the ability to bring structure to chaotic business problems by breaking them into parts that can be analyzed using various techniques. Business problems are all around us. In fact, you may have seen some in your recent co-op placements, or perhaps your parents are dealing with business problems right now at their jobs.</p><p>Each of you will be asked to conduct a one-hour interview (live, by video or on the phone) with someone facing a business problem at the moment (perhaps a former manager, a relative or someone you know who is currently working in a business).  We will define what we mean by “business problem” in class.  You will then write a 600 to 900-word summary of that business problem using the concepts we discuss in class.  Your goal is not to <i>solve</i> the problem or provide a solution in this assignment.  It is only to break the problem into smaller components so it can be tackled in a methodical way by a consultant.</p><p><strong><u>Client Deliverable (20%)</u></strong></p><p>You will create a short document (in PowerPoint) that proposes a solution to the business problem faced by a large company of your choosing (i.e., different from the subject of your Business Problem Analysis).  You will use the analytical tools presented in the course to write the report for the company’s CEO using information you collect from the library and/or online. As with the Business Problem Analysis, you must clearly identify the problem faced by the company and break it into components before doing the research and proposing solutions to the CEO.  You are free to use any secondary information source you wish but you must cite your data using hyperlinks on each slide. </p><p>Your goal is to be clear and concise, to use secondary sources creatively, and to produce a deliverable that is free of any typos or formatting issues.  This is your chance to show that you are ready to become a consultant and may even be something you would want to take with you to a job interview someday. </p><p><strong><u>Team Grades</u></strong></p><p>In the real world of consulting, clients judge the whole team together, not as a group of individuals – <i>even if some members did more work than others</i>.  There is to “I” in consulting (okay, maybe there is <i>one</i>, but you get my point…).  So all team assignments will receive one grade, no matter the level of effort expended by different team members.  However, you will have an opportunity to recognize those on your team who have contributed more (or less) than average at the end of the term.  You will be randomly assigned to a team of 6.  Although I will assign teams randomly, if there is one other person you would like on your team, please let me know by the end of class #1.     </p><p><strong><u>Consulting Proposal (15%)</u></strong></p><p>Your team will create a mock consulting firm.  You will give it a name and logo and determine how you will position your firm. Then, you will write a formal consulting proposal.  Your proposal will take the form of a “letter of engagement”, a simple type of consulting proposal that contains an approach to answering these questions (not your ultimate business recommendations, just your <i>approach</i> to solving it).  Like your individual Business Problem Analysis (above), the proposal should be built around a structured break-down of a problem. </p><p>You will pick a problem you see around campus and a hypothetical “client” who currently must address that problem.  The problem need <i>not</i> be a “business” problem.  It could be anything from solving long lines at the Tim’s to keeping Canada Geese from doing their business on the paths around campus. </p><p><strong><u>Group Presentation (15%)</u></strong></p><p>Consulting is all about communicating with clients and conveying confidence in your plan of action. Therefore, after writing your formal consulting proposal, you will present it to the class as if they were your prospective client.  Your pitch will be 7 minutes in length and will take the form of a recorded PowerPoint MP4 (I will explain more in class).  </p><p>Several of your classmates will be anonymously assigned to evaluate your pitch.  The top 4 teams will present in class for an amazing prize.  In the end, your classmates’ evaluations will be combined with my own evaluation to determine your final grade for this presentation. </p><p><strong><u>Reflection (7%)</u></strong></p><p>At the end of the team projects, you will be asked to reflect in your team’s proposal and pitch by listing 5 things that went well and 5 things you would do differently next time (200-300 words).  You will also be asked to confidentially evaluate your teammates’ contributions to your group assignments (which will impact your class participation score).</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
