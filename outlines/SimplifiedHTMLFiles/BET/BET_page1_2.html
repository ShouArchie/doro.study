  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>BET 100:</div>
<p>Successful entrepreneurs combine intellectual rigour with innovation to create solutions that have impact. It is a process that starts with a search for "big ideas" using tools such as research, observation, and appreciative inquiry. Next, entrepreneurs analyze situations and apply creativity techniques to develop solutions. Finally, solutions are tested against business drivers including customer value propositions, customer identification, channel selection, and resource needs. This course covers the three steps that form the foundation of all entrepreneurial success: big ideas, solutions, and testing. Because of its broad scope, the course is valuable to students from different academic backgrounds, entrepreneurship interests, and program level.</p>

<p>BET 100 introduces you to the principles underlying successful entrepreneurial behaviour and equips you with an understanding of tools, knowledge and models used by entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial employees. As the course progresses, your appreciation for the importance of entrepreneurship will increase, as will your ability to understand, apply and implement a number of advanced practices related to entrepreneurial behaviour and success.</p>

<div>
<h3>Course Policies</h3><p>All submissions, both graded and ungraded, should be presented in a “professional” style, as described below. Failure to follow the style guide may result in the deduction of up to 10% of the assignment mark. Failure to follow the citation format correctly may result in no credit granted for the aspect of the assignment related to that citation.</p><h4>Citation</h4><ul><li>Citations do not count towards the word count.</li><li>ANY content you have not created yourself must be cited using the <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/">APA formatting style</a>.</li><li>Social media citations must adhere to the <a href="http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2013/10/how-to-cite-social-media-in-apa-style.html">How to Cite Social Media in APA Style</a>.</li><li>It is NOT sufficient to merely cite <i>Twitter</i>, and provide no other information.</li></ul><h4>Late Policy</h4><p>Any assignment submitted after the due date and time will result in late penalty equal to 4% of the assignment mark. An additional 4% penalty will be applied for each additional 24 hour period after the due date and time. No assignment will be accepted more than one week after the deadline. In case of illness, appropriate documentation must be submitted.</p><h4>Re-Grade Policy</h4><p>Tremendous training effort is put in to ensure that all Course Assistants apply the marking rubrics for each assignment in a fair reasonable manner therefore requests for a regrades are generally not approved. When regrades are approved, the majority of regrade requests receive no change in marks, with a minor proportion of requests receiving an insignificant amount of grade modification of +/– 2 marks per assignments. If you wish to apply for a regrade, please email your assigned Course Assistant to discuss your request.</p><h4>ChatGPT and AI Tools</h4><p>Using ChatGPT (or similar tools that generate text, code, or visual images) for content generation and submitting it as one’s own original work is a violation of the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">University of Waterloo’s Policy 71 (Student Discipline)</a>.</p><h3>Style Guide</h3><p>Deductions of up to 10% of the assignment mark can be made for improper use or lack of use of the style format described in this section. Accurate use of citations is necessary in order to receive credit for the related portion of the assignment.</p><p>Failure to follow the style guide may result in the deduction of up to 10% of the assignment mark. </p><p>In general, please use complete sentences in the submission of your work (i.e., avoid point form and abbreviations). Exceptions to this are the creative process in Your Challenge 3 and the business model canvas in Your Challenge 5.  </p><p>The word limits stated for each relevant Challenge are a requirement and not a suggestion. A penalty will apply if the word limit is exceeded. </p><p>The business model canvas must follow the format prescribed in the course content.</p><p>Canadian spelling is the expected standard.</p><p>Submissions should follow the outline of the assignment tasks, with headings or numbered sections as appropriate.</p><p>We expect you to produce a clear, easily understood submission. It is usually not a good idea to have the person evaluating your work “try and figure out" what you mean.</p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples.

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
