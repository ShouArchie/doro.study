  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>BET 340:</div>
<p>Entrepreneurial success starts with finding a solution to a problem and then creating the right strategy to bring it to market. The final step in the process is explored in this course, the disciplined execution of strategy. A broad range of skills are required to do this including understanding founder and team dynamics, hiring and firing, cash flow management, project management, developing suitable equity structures and compensation, pitching, fundraising, internal and external communications, and people skills. This course explores the business skills and knowledge needed to take a new venture, whether it is a start-up or part of an existing organization, from strategy to market.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurial success involves creating an innovative solution to a “big problem.” But in addition to validating their business model (i.e., how they intend to create, deliver, and capture value), entrepreneurs must develop a strategy to bring this solution to market. Eventually, they must execute this strategy. This course is primarily concerned with this execution process. It recognizes that successful execution calls for exceptional judgments and decision-making involving challenging tasks—such as building a founding team; hiring, motivating, and firing employees; pitching to investors; managing cash flow; communicating with internal and external stakeholders; acquiring and onboarding customers; negotiating with industry partners; and managing multiple projects. Thus, there is an emphasis on actionable insights that can foster entrepreneurial judgment and decision-making. Ultimately, these insights can enable enterprising individuals to successfully take on a new venture—either as a start-up or part of an existing organization—from strategy to market.</p><p>Teaching Methods: This course will be delivered in person, with the physical location to be announced in advance. In compliance with its objectives, various teaching techniques will be used. These may include lectures, seminars, case studies, individual or group presentations, individual or group exercises, self-assessment surveys, and audiovisual materials. In addition, guest lecturers may be invited to augment the learning process. </p>

I will facilitate this by allowing you to submit your <i><strong>best work</strong></i> for only four of these seven possible mini-assignments:</p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment 1: Equity Distribution (Lesson 3: Co-founders)</strong></p><p>Read this case study (see the PDF listed in the LEARN post) titled: “How much is sweat equity worth?” by Christopher Marquis and Joshua D. Margolis. Discuss whether Brooks should give Tyler half of his stake in Erbe. If not, how should the equity be distributed? Why? The written response should be a maximum of 600 words. A strong submission is more than an opinion piece and should use the ideas from the readings, videos, and any additional research you do.</p><p>Note: Use the questions as a guide rather than answer them. Instead, use an essay-style format. See the post “Some tips for your written assignments” on Learn.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment 2: Business Negotiations (Lesson 4b: Sales &amp;Negotiations)</strong></p><p>Use the planning document on Learn to plan for and engage in an actual business negotiation within the next two weeks. This should involve cases in which there is at least one real substantive interest (i.e., you want something for an economic or financial reason) alongside potential relationship interests, combined with a desire to reach an agreement through bargaining or adjusting relevant terms. Some prominent examples include negotiating a job offer, purchasing or selling an item, renting or subletting a property, and negotiating with a co-founder or investor. Whether you reach an agreement or not, you are expected to submit a <i><strong>600-word (maximum) journal report </strong></i>that covers these three areas in a clear, precise, compelling, and coherent way:</p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>Brief description of what happened</strong> (up to 150 words): Share relevant background information upfront: what the negotiation was about; your role versus your counterparty’s role; your negotiation strategy and tactics; whether your negotiation ended with or without an agreement; and whether you were satisfied with your agreement outcomes in substantive (i.e., economic interests) and relationship (i.e., interest in a positive, long-term relationship) terms, or the state of your disagreement or impasse.</li><li><strong>Perspective</strong> (up to 350 words): You must comprehensively explain and substantiate why your specific negotiation strategy and tactics worked, or were ineffective, in your situation, taking your counterparty’s strategies/tactics, among other situational factors, into account. More generally, there should be a clear and logical chain of reasoning, arguments or storytelling that precisely connects the strategy and tactics deployed to the anticipated negotiation outcomes. The perspective section is the most critical component of your journal report.</li><li><strong>Application to future negotiation situations </strong>(up to 100 words): Share concrete insights on what you would do the same way or differently when faced with specific conditions in a future negotiation situation. In other words, how differently would you engage in negotiation planning? When and how would you adjust your assumptions, strategies, and tactics to optimize the chance of reaching a satisfactory agreement?</li></ul><p>High-quality reports will address all these issues while integrating course content and external(cited) research to add deep, engaging, and novel insights.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment 3: Better conversations (Lesson 5b: Communication)</strong></p><p>Watch the linked TedxCreativeCoast presentation (“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1vskiVDwl4">10 ways to have a better conversation</a>”) by Celeste Headlee. I want you to explain in your own words what two of the tips mean to you: what can you change about what you do now, what do you already do well, what would someone else say you already did well, what could you most improve at and how will you do it? The point of this assignment is to think about how you can improve your conversational skills. </p><p>Note: Use the questions as a guide rather than answer them. Instead, use an essay-style format. See the post “Some tips for your written assignments” on Learn. The word limit is a maximum of 600 words.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment 4: Pitching (Lesson7: Investors)</strong></p><p>Upload a 3-minute pitch(maximum) for a venture idea of your own, OR pick an existing venture you are excited about. This pitch must include a short pitch deck, which should be narrated (e.g., you can narrate this pitch deck using PowerPoint with audio/video narration). Make sure your file format is appropriate to upload,</p><p>You must submit <i>one final file for this</i> assignment. Regardless of your choice, follow the advice from the pitch deck readings.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment 5: Cash Flow (Lesson 9b: Cash)</strong></p><p>Check out the Cash Flow Statement provided on LEARN in the assignment Dropbox folder. Please take some time to analyze the cash flow statement to make sense of it. As a venture grows, so will the resources to hire a CFO, but at the start, each founder should understand the basics of cash flow. Therefore, analyze this cash flow statement and answer the following questions:</p><ul><li>What is each month's “burn rate” (Oct-Dec)?</li><li>What is the Runway if there is no borrowing?</li><li>What is the most logical way of obtaining more cash for the months needed? Sell equity? Bank loan? Line-of-credit? Something else? Explain your reasoning.</li></ul><p>Other questions: Evaluate the financial affairs of the business</p><ul><li>What are the common themes you see from this cash flow? For example, are there positive aspects to this cash flow? Are there concerning patterns in this cash flow statement?</li><li>What suggestions do you have to improve this cash flow statement? For instance, where can you spot opportunities to save money?</li><li>What are the key takeaway lessons regarding sources of cash, cash flow, and financial discipline?</li></ul><p>More precisely, I expect you to do the following:</p><ul><li>completed schedules or tables (from schedule 1. A to 6. F).</li><li>Provide short-answer responses to questions 7, 8 and 9.</li><li>For “other questions,” use an essay format to evaluate the business's financial affairs—using the "other questions" as a guide rather than answering them directly.​ The written response should be a maximum of 600 words. Feel free to use an Appendix to include additional information (however, do not use this space to extend your discussion. Use it only to present additional information – e.g., analyses, infographics, etc.). A strong submission should use the ideas from the readings, videos, and any additional research you do.</li></ul><p>Note: Use the questions as a guide rather than answering them. Instead, use an essay-style form.” See “Some tips for your written assignments” in the post on Learn.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment 6: IP - Patents (Lesson10a: Patents)</strong></p><p>Being able to find and read patents is a valuable skill, but uncovering patents is rarely easy to do. In this lesson, you will learn the basics about patents as a type of intellectual property, including what a patent is, why you might patent something, where patent literature is located, how to search for it, and how to read a patent document effectively. For this assignment, you will get hands-on experience searching for patents, and you will be able to demonstrate your knowledge of creating complex search strategies and identifying effective classification codes. To complete this assignment, go to LEARN and look for the Word document in Assignment 6 that comprises all the details for this assignment. This unique assignment is based on the self-guided PowerPoint that Rachel Figueiredo (our librarian specializing in entrepreneurship) created for us.</p><p>Please direct any questions to Rachel, who can be contacted at <a href="mailto:rachel.figueiredo@uwaterloo.ca">rachel.figueiredo@uwaterloo.ca</a> (please copy me on the email).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment 7: Pivots (Lesson11: Pivots)</strong></p><p>Choose a company you are currently with or a company from your top three preferred future employers. Discuss one pivot that could be beneficial for the venture in the future. In your written assignment, provide some <u>brief</u> context to set up the discussion on the pivot (e.g., what is the name of the venture, what service product they provide to customers, why their business is working or not, who is their target market, etc.). Then, discuss the need for the pivot. Focus on discussing explicit quantifiable criteria, where possible. Lastly, what kind of pivot should this venture consider? Why? Your response should be a <i><strong>maximum of 600 words</strong></i>. A strong submission incorporates information from the weekly lesson (posted in lesson 8) and includes compelling reasons for making a pivot and why the proposed pivot is appropriate.</p><p>Note: Use the questions as a guide rather than answer them. Instead, use an essay-style format. See the post “Some tips for your written assignments” on Learn.</p><p>Criteria used to evaluate the core elements of an outstanding assignment:</p><ul><li>Foundational Elements (30%): Provides an excellent response to the assignment objectives; concepts are correctly interpreted; excellent application of course concepts; content of the assignment goes above and beyond expectations (involves some creativity).</li><li>Depth, Focus, and Arguments(50%): Provides an excellent response to the assignment objectives; concepts are correctly interpreted; excellent application of course concepts; content of the assignment goes above and beyond expectations (involves some creativity); meaningful and thoughtful critical analysis of the content; significant depth and focus that exceed expectations.<ul><li>Structure (10%): Outstanding assignment structure; clear introduction; smooth transitions; thoughtful conclusion.</li><li>Writing Mechanisms (10%): Extremely well-written assignment; sentences are well-formed and appropriately varied in length and style; few, if any, spelling or grammatical errors.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Source: Adapted the ‘Sample Analytic Rubric’ from the Centre for Teaching Excellence, University of Waterloo.</p><p>Note: Assignments that go above and beyond involve creativity (e.g., integrating external references, creating clever graphics that illustrate a critical point, etc.). The goal is to get your assignments marked within two weeks of the due date. </p><h2>Business Titan Tournament [Group work: 22% of Course Grade]</h2><h3><i>Factile Business Jeopardy</i> [Group work: 6% of Course Grade]</h3><p>We will use Factile to play team-based Jeopardy business games over six weeks. A randomly drawn half of the groups from the Marketplace Simulation competition (see below) will play Factile during the first, third, and fifth weeks. Meanwhile, the remaining groups will play during the second, fourth and sixth weeks. Your group’s accumulated points and ranking will determine its share of 6%. Your active involvement (i.e., attendance and contributions) in the Jeopardy games will determine your share of the team grade.</p><h3><i>Marketplace Simulation</i> [Group work: 16% of Course Grade—Simulation performance and report 8% each]</h3><p>In the past, there has been minimal opportunity to experiment with starting a real new business as part of your business education. It has been too risky, time-consuming, and expensive for a single-term course. But Marketplace makes up for this in essential ways. </p><p>Through computer simulation, you will start and run a virtual company with your classmates for one-and-a-half years of compressed business life cycle (i.e., from the startup stage to development, growth and eventually, near maturity)—which amounts to six weeks of decision-making rounds in class. In addition to evaluating the market opportunity, you are expected to execute your venture’s strategy across multiple functions—from marketing to distribution, manufacturing, human resources, finance, accounting, and team management. Repeatedly, you will analyze your business situation in a domestic or international market, plan a strategy to improve it and then execute that strategy. You will face great uncertainty from the outside environment and your business situation. Incrementally, you will learn to skillfully adjust your strategy as you discover the nature of real-life decisions, including the available options, linkages to other parts of the business, conflicts, tradeoffs, and potential outcomes.</p><p>Your Marketplace grades will come from these two sources:</p><p>End-of-Simulation cumulative performance grade [8% of course grade]: The simulation will generate a graded cumulative balanced scorecard at the end, which will be converted to a share of 10% of your course grade.</p><p>Marketplace Journal Report [8 % of course grade]: Throughout operating your virtual venture in Marketplace, I expect you to reflect on what you and your classmates do and the associated performance results. This will require you to distance yourself from the immediate business situations or outcomes, pinpoint critical events and processes, and integrate course and external content to produce insightful analyses. After doing so, you are expected to write a journal report with a maximum of <i>1000 words</i>. This form of report must cover these core areas in a clear, compelling, and coherent way:</p><ul><li><strong>Brief description of what happened </strong>(up to 200 words): Share relevant background information upfront: what is your business about; what competitive strategy and tactics you relied on; how your company performed over the last three quarters; and whether you are satisfied with your performance.</li><li><strong>Perspective </strong>(up to 650 words): You must comprehensively explain and substantiate why and how your specific competitive strategy and tactics were effective or ineffective in your changing business situations, taking your competitors’ strategies and tactics, among other situational factors (i.e., changing operational and financial performance and customer needs), into account. This is the most critical component of your journal report.</li><li><strong>Application to future business situations </strong>(up to 150 words): Share concrete insights on what you would do the same way or differently when faced with specific conditions in a future business situation. In other words, how differently would you engage in venture planning and execution? When and how would you adjust your assumptions and strategies to adapt to changing situations and improve business performance?</li></ul><p>You could make your work even more outstanding by integrating relevant concepts and perspectives from course material and external (cited) research. In doing so, you could add profound, engaging, and novel insights beyond what we covered in class. In other words, intentionally search for external academic or practitioner articles, integrate relevant insights with what you already know from course content, and ultimately, try to discover and share new and relevant insights that deepen our understanding of why and how to execute a venture strategy more effectively and efficiently. After all, I want to learn something new from you too!</p><p><strong>Required</strong>: <i><strong>Your Marketplace journal report must include</strong></i> <i><strong>the names of contributing group members, their functional responsibilities in the simulation, and precisely how they contribute to the written report.</strong></i></p><p>You are generally expected to attend and actively participate in class activities consistently. This is particularly important for Marketplace simulation exercises. Regular attendance and active participation will directly impact the quality of your group members’ learning experience and simulation outcomes. Therefore, be mindful of your commitment to attendance and participation. This course <i><strong>might not be a good fit for you if you know of schedule conflicts that could result in two or more missed classes</strong></i><strong>.</strong> See the <i>attendance policy</i> below for more details.</p><h2>Group Projects: Final Paper and Presentation [22% of Course Grade: Paper, 14%; Presentation, 8%]</h2><p>You will self-enrol in groups to write and present a paper on a relevant venture planning and execution topic. There are two types of topics (i.e., founder general topics) that your group can choose from:</p><p> </p><ol><li><strong>Founder topics</strong>: Use relevant aspects of a founder’s life and business experience to provide deep insights on a specific question or issue related to venture planning and execution—you are expected to primarily focus on the question or problem while using only relevant facts about the founder’s life and business to develop or support your key arguments, points, or perspective coherently. You are expected to draw on relevant course content and external research to add depth and novelty to your work.<strong> </strong>Start with a question you want to answer, then consider which aspects of the founder’s life and business experience are most relevant. And, of course, carefully consider whether you know enough about founders and their business ventures to address your question authoritatively and insightfully. If you don’t, I strongly recommend choosing a general topic instead. Carefully read the extended guidance and relevant rubric below.</li><li><strong>General topics: </strong>You could choose a general topic related to venture planning and execution that this course has not yet covered (or inadequately covered). Here are some sample topics: how an economy-wide development (e.g., economic crisis, pandemic or immigration flows) or government-sponsored innovation/entrepreneurship initiative (e.g., government funding for new or emerging startup ecosystem),  has affected any of the following: small businesses and entrepreneurs in specific industries; how to build unicorn companies; gender, ethnic, or racial differences in entrepreneurship in a particular industry (i.e., science or technology); founder burnout or well-being; generating and monetizing intellectual property (IP). Again, start by coming up with a question you want to comprehensively answer—possibly by drawing on external academic or practitioner research, case studies, or a combination of these resources. Carefully read the extended guidance and relevant rubric below.</li></ol><p><strong>Additional information and clarifications on the group paper you are expected to write. </strong></p><p>Your written paper should be a maximum of <i><strong>1500 words</strong></i>. It will be graded out of 100 and converted to a share of 14% of the course grade, the weight assigned to this report component of your teamwork. </p><p><i><strong>Instructor-Group Meetings</strong></i>: As a first step, please arrange to meet with me to discuss and confirm your research topic and question before proceeding. But note that I will primarily consider these questions when evaluating your topic and question: What exactly will I learn from you that could help me gain a deeper understanding of venture planning and execution (i.e., how to formulate and execute venture strategies and operations) and how to get better performance outcomes? How does this work build on and add to what we already know about venture planning and execution in this course? After you confirm a topic and question with me, you are required to post them on the “Group Papers-Presentations: Topics and Questions” section of the discussion forum on LEARN. </p><p>Whether you plan to focus on a topic connected to a founder or a general topic, recognize that you can develop an outstanding paper by addressing a specific venture planning and execution topic and related question in a focused, clear, deep, compelling, and coherent way. This includes sharing novel and profound insights from course material and external research. In other words, please undertake well-written work that challenges what we already know about venture planning and execution or helps us understand how to perform essential venture planning and execution tasks. This means working diligently to ensure that your work does not elicit this reaction from the informed reader: “So what?”. </p><p>If you are considering a topic linked to a founder or a general topic, stay focused and carefully manage the scope of your work—because covering too many issues or themes could result in unfocused work without novel or profound insights. One way to do so is to establish the core question you want to address for your selected topic. After deciding on the critical question, consider how you will structure your work to help readers quickly navigate it. Ultimately, you should help them learn something new and exciting about venture planning and execution. </p><p>For a topic inspired by a founder, it is essential to first frame and position your topic and question in the relevant course, practitioner, or academic work. Afterwards, you can clarify why and how you will use relevant aspects of the founder’s life and business venture to address them. Do not provide a separate biographic or business overview upfront. Instead, progressively draw on relevant founder- and business-related information, combined with appropriate course content and external research, to develop focused, nuanced, and deep insights on your core topic and question.</p><p>For a general topic, it is similarly critical to start with a solid opening paragraph that frames and positions your topic and question in the relevant course, practitioner, or academic work and, ultimately, sets the stage for your follow-on discussion—which should be carefully developed with appropriate arguments, evidence and cited work over several well-connected paragraphs. I will return to this line of advice below.</p><p>In general, your conclusion section should include justified recommendations or takeaway messages (i.e., based on the insights or findings discussed) and can result in more efficient and effective strategy execution. </p><p>To emphasize the expected focused and careful approach to the selected topic and question, note the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Do not</strong> write a predominantly descriptive paper covering one or more of these things: (a) founder’s life or business story or general background information. (b) overviews on the founder’s business experiences and outcomes, (c) broad coverage of external factors (i.e., crisis) that impact broadly covered aspects of startup or new venture operations, (d) broad coverage of multiple aspects of venture planning and execution for founders, new ventures, or established companies, based on what we already know from course content. Instead, frame and position your crucial topic and question upfront and selectively use relevant background and information to develop and share compelling and insightful ideas that build on what we already know--by appropriately combining insights from case analysis (i.e., specific information about the deal in question), course content, and external research.</li><li>Avoid making unsubstantiated assertions when trying to justify your arguments or perspectives. Specifically, instead of saying that something is vital for the success of a founder or business, provide concrete support by using relevant arguments (logic or theory), case study findings, and statistical evidence. This is especially critical when explaining why and how specific founder, business or external factors account for the founder- and business-related outcomes (i.e., success or failure) addressed. Based on the rubric below, this component of your work falls under “Analysis and Applications,” which accounts for a relatively large proportion of your marks.</li></ul><p><strong>Group paper rubric</strong>--I will use the following criteria to mark your group paper:</p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>Foundational Elements </strong>(30%)<ul><li>Start by introducing the topic and conveying why it is relevant to entrepreneurial planning and execution. There is a strong hook (i.e., statistic, question, quote, or anecdote) that grabs the reader’s attention.</li><li>Appropriately frame and position the topic in relevant background work. Specifically, briefly describe relevant insights or findings from coursework, practitioner articles, or academic research. Next, make a case for your paper by clarifying what is missing from this background work or inadequately understood, why it is essential to address this gap and state the question you will answer to do so.</li><li>The relevant aspects of the business context or background are clearly and precisely described.</li><li>Appropriate examples or cases are used to illustrate the key concepts meaningfully.</li><li>Valid sources support all primary and supporting points.</li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><strong>Perspective and Applications </strong>(50%)<ul><li>Core perspective (i.e., idea, thesis, explanation, theory) is developed, substantiated, and articulated clearly, precisely, coherently and compellingly.
