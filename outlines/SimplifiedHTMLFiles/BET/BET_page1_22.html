  Course Description

<div>
<div>BET 460:</div>
<p>We negotiate every day with potential employers, coworkers, merchants, service providers, customers, and suppliers. Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more independent parties. It is a craft that must hold co-operation and competition in creative tension, and even the most experienced negotiators often fall prey to common biases and errors in judgment. This course is highly experiential; therefore, students will practise, reflect, analyze, and practice again.</p>

<p>Knowing how to negotiate business deals effectively is an essential skill for entrepreneurs. They must initiate deals with various parties—from potential co-founders or employees to clients, investors, suppliers, corporate partners, and other external stakeholders.  Yet, they often find themselves at a disadvantage and unprepared to close these deals. But whether you are an existing or aspiring founder, learning how to negotiate effectively can tip the balance in your favour. <i>Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more parties</i>. A key challenge is creating and claiming as much value as possible without making the other party unacceptably worse off in actual or perceived terms. This requires managing the conflict-prone tensions between <i>value creation</i> and <i>value claiming</i> or <i>cooperation </i>and <i>competition</i> in such deals.  Even experienced negotiators sometimes struggle to get this right because biases, errors in judgment, and ethical dilemmas get in the way. This course integrates theory and practice by intensively using realistic negotiation exercises that can improve your negotiation skills. As a result, it offers an enriched learning experience that can help you excel at business negotiations. </p><p>Teaching Methods: This course will be delivered in person, with the physical location to be announced in advance. In compliance with its objectives, various teaching techniques will be used. These may include lectures, seminars, case studies, individual or group presentations, individual or group exercises, self-assessment surveys, and audiovisual materials. In addition, guest lecturers may be invited to augment the learning process. </p>

<p>The course content is primarily grounded in a series of negotiation (“role-play”) exercises, along with assigned readings (e.g., cases) that will be shared or referenced on Learn after these exercises. Always do the readings after the exercises. This is essential for clarifying and reinforcing their key learning points.</p><p><strong>Suggested Additional Readings:</strong></p><p>1.    Various business magazines: The Economist, Fortune, Forbes, Canadian Business, Inc., Harvard Business Review, Fast Company, and others. </p><p>2.    Daily newspapers: Check out their business and international sections for articles related to the course topics.</p><p><a href="https://idecisiongames.com/promo-home"><strong>iDecisionGames.com</strong></a><strong> (iDG)</strong></p><p>This online negotiation platform manages the core negotiation exercises. You are required to sign up for this platform at a cost. In addition, you are expected to bring a smart device (e.g., tablet or laptop computer) to class for online negotiation exercises.</p>

When you do negotiation exercises, you must carefully and professionally approach them along with the following debriefs. The quality of your contributions matters. This spans how deeply engaged you are in negotiation exercises with various partners and how well you perform on these exercises. It would be best if you also strived for active participation in related class discussions. A “high-quality” contribution to a debate is associated with one or more of these characteristics:</p><ul><li>Shares a unique and relevant perspective.</li><li>Builds on and advances the current discourse.</li><li>Is grounded in persuasive arguments, established conceptual or theoretical insights, reliable evidence and relevant current events.</li></ul><p>Your regular attendance and active participation will directly impact the quality of your classmates’ learning experience. Therefore, be mindful of your commitment to attendance and participation. This course <i>might not be a good fit for you if you know of schedule conflicts that could result in two or more missed classes</i>. See the <i>attendance policy</i> below for more details.</p><p>Note that the participation grade will be adjusted downward for students whose behaviours (e.g., side conversations, inappropriate use of devices, lateness or leaving early, and other incivilities) interfere with the virtual or in-person activities (e.g., lessons, negotiation exercises, debriefing sessions, group work, and presentations) or the broader learning experience of other students.</p><p><i><strong>Negotiation Planning and Role Preparation </strong></i>[15% of grade]</p><p>To get the most out of the scheduled negotiation exercises, you must carefully read the exercise materials and the instructions for your assigned role in advance. Based on the <i>negotiation planning document </i>provided in <strong>iDG</strong>, you will confirm that you have thoughtfully completed and submitted this document before the negotiation exercise. You are also expected to use your completed document when negotiating. Each completed document should be a maximum of <i><strong>600 words</strong></i>. </p><p>Your grade for negotiation planning and role preparation will depend on these two factors: (a) the number of adequately completed planning documents and (b) the efficacy of your negotiation planning and role preparation (i.e., z-scores achieved on scorable exercises as described below). Specifically, I will use this step-by-step approach to determine your grade: </p><p><strong>Step 1/3: Confirm the adequacy of your negotiation preparation</strong></p><p>Determine whether each completed negotiation planning document is adequate (i.e., “adequate, 1” versus “inadequate, 0”) for your assigned role and negotiation situation.

p>where the gain is the surplus above what you would get if there were no negotiation agreement (i.e., the quantitative result for your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA)). To make the gains comparable across negotiators (i.e., control for differences in bargaining power across negotiation partners), I will separate the gains by role (e.g., gains for buyers only versus sellers). The more similar (or different) the gains are for the same-role negotiators, the more each negotiator represents (or departs from) the “average negotiator,” which implies a lower (or higher) standard deviation of the gains for the same role.</p><p><i><strong>Z-score</strong></i>: Your calculated z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from (below or above) the average same-role gain your gain lies.  Consequently, the higher (or lower) your z-score, the better (or worse) your negotiation performance on a scorable exercise—which could reflect your negotiation skills, random events (i.e., “good luck” or “bad luck”), and negotiation-specific events (i.e., incompatible negotiation styles or personality traits between you and your negotiation partners). I will ensure that your negotiation skills predominantly determine your negotiation performance by using iDG to assign you to negotiation roles and groups randomly.</p><p>As an illustration, suppose you realized a gain of $700 on selling your iPhone (i.e., you sold it to buyer A for $1000 but could have sold it to buyer B at $300 (i.e., your BATNA)). Assume that iPhone sellers have made a gain of $450 on average. Meanwhile, the standard deviation of sellers’ gains is $350.

This will require you to distance yourself from the immediate negotiation situation, pinpoint critical events and processes, and integrate course and external content to produce deep insights. Going one step further, you will need to share your analyses in a structured way by completing well-written journal report assignments for 2 of 4 negotiations. </p><p>Each written journal report should be a maximum of <i><strong>600 words</strong></i>. Specifically, you are expected to prepare a report that covers these three core areas in a clear, precise, compelling, and coherent way:</p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>Brief description of what happened </strong>(up to 150 words): Share relevant background information upfront: what the negotiation was about; your role versus your counterparty’s role; your negotiation strategy and tactics; whether your negotiation ended with or without an agreement; and whether you were satisfied with your agreement outcomes in substantive (i.e., economic interests) and relationship (i.e., interested in a positive, long-term relationship) terms, or the state of your disagreement or impasse.</li><li><strong>Perspective </strong>(up to 350 words): You must comprehensively explain and substantiate why and how your specific negotiation strategy and tactics worked, or were ineffective, in your situation, taking your counterparty’s strategy/tactics, among other situational factors, into account. More generally, there should be a clear and logical chain of reasoning, arguments, or storytelling that precisely connects the strategy and tactics deployed to the negotiation outcomes that materialize. The perspective section is the most critical component of your journal report.</li><li><strong>Application to future negotiation situations </strong>(up to 100 words): Drawing on insights from the perspective section, share concrete insights on what you would do the same way or differently when faced with specific conditions in a future negotiation situation. In other words, how differently would you engage in negotiation planning? When and how would you adjust your assumptions, strategies, and tactics to optimize the chance of reaching a satisfactory agreement?</li></ul><p>You could make your work (especially the perspective section) even more outstanding by integrating relevant concepts and perspectives from course material and external (cited) research. In doing so, you could add profound, engaging, and novel insights beyond what we covered in class. In other words, intentionally search for external academic or practitioner articles, integrate relevant insights with what you already know from course content, and ultimately, try to discover and share new and relevant insights that deepen our understanding of why and how to negotiate more effectively and efficiently. After all, I want to learn something new from you too!</p><p>You may choose 2 of these four negotiations: <strong>Zephyr</strong>, <strong>Atalanta</strong>, <strong>Aerospace Investment</strong> and <strong>D-Loyal</strong>. You are expected to submit your journal report on Learn (Dropbox folder) one week after your chosen negotiation exercise is debriefed. In addition, you are expected to upload your journal reports on iDG.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Group Projects: Final Paper and Presentation on Negotiation</strong><i><strong> </strong></i>[40% of grade]</p><p>During a specified period, you can self-enrol in groups for group projects featuring a written paper and presentation on negotiation-related topics. Each group must select a distinct, exciting negotiation topic along these two lines: (a) Use a real-world business deal to address a specific negotiation topic and question or (b) Review and integrate relevant academic and practitioner research on a general negotiation topic and question. </p><p><strong>Additional information and clarifications on the group paper you are expected to write</strong></p><p>Your written paper should be a maximum of <i><strong>1500 words</strong></i>. It will be graded out of 100 and converted to a share of 25% of the course grade, the weight assigned to this paper component of your teamwork. </p><p><i><strong>Instructor-Group Meetings</strong></i>: As a first step, please arrange to meet with me to discuss and confirm your research topic and question before proceeding. But note that I will primarily consider these questions when evaluating your topic and question: What exactly will I learn from you that could help me gain a deeper understanding of how business negotiations work (i.e., how to formulate and execute negotiation strategies and tactics) and how to get better results? How will your work build on and add to what we already know about business negotiations? After you confirm a topic and question with me, you are required to post your topic and question in the “Group Papers-Presentations: Topics and Questions” section of the discussion forum on LEARN. </p><p>Whether you plan to focus on a topic connected to a business negotiation case or a general topic, recognize that you could develop an outstanding paper by addressing a specific negotiation topic and related question in a focused, clear, deep, compelling, and coherent way. This includes sharing novel and profound insights from course material and external research. In other words, do well-written work that challenges what we already know about business negotiation or helps us better understand how to perform essential strategic and tactical tasks better when negotiating. This means working diligently to ensure that your work does not elicit this reaction from the informed reader: “So what?”. </p><p>If you are considering a real-world negotiation case or a general topic, stay focused and carefully manage the scope of your work—because covering too many issues or themes could result in unfocused work without novel or profound insights. One way to do so is to establish the core negotiation question you want to address for your selected topic. After deciding on the critical question, consider how you will structure your work to help readers quickly navigate it and eventually learn something new and exciting about formulating and executing business negotiation strategies. </p><p>For a business case, it is essential to initially develop a brief upfront description of the negotiation situation. You can then progressively draw on relevant case information to create focused, nuanced, deep insights into your core issue or question. For a general topic, it is similarly critical to start with a solid opening paragraph that frames the relevant subject and sets the stage for your discussion—which should be carefully developed with appropriate arguments, evidence, and cited work over several well-connected paragraphs. </p><p>Your conclusion section should include justified recommendations or takeaway messages (i.e., based on the insights or findings discussed). It can result in more efficient and effective negotiation strategies and tactics. </p><p>To emphasize the expected focused and careful approach, note the following:</p><ul><li>When considering a specific negotiation deal, <strong>do not</strong> write a predominantly descriptive paper that mainly covers one or more of these things: (a) background information. (b) the specifics of a negotiation deal, (c) the general application of distributive, integrative or mixed negotiation strategies. Instead, frame and position your crucial topic and question upfront and selectively use relevant background and deal information to develop and share compelling and insightful ideas that build on what we already know—by appropriately combining insights from case analysis (i.e., only relevant information about the deal in question), course content and external research. Regarding negotiation strategies, I strongly recommend focusing on a specific aspect of a distributive, integrative or mixed strategy or tactics.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Avoid making unsubstantiated assertions when developing arguments or perspectives. Specifically, instead of saying that something is essential for the described negotiation results (i.e., mutually satisfactory agreement or disagreement/impasse), provide concrete support by using relevant arguments (logic or theory), case study findings, and statistical evidence. This is especially critical when explaining why and how specific strategic and tactical factors account for the negotiation outcomes addressed. Based on the rubric below, this component of your work falls under “Perspective and Applications,” which accounts for a relatively large proportion of your marks.</li></ul><p><strong>Group paper rubric</strong>--I will use the following criteria to mark your group paper:</p><p> </p><ul><li>Foundational Elements (30%)<ul><li>Start by introducing the topic and conveying why it is relevant to the formulation and execution of a strategic negotiation plan in a business context. There is a strong hook (i.e., statistic, question, quote, or anecdote) that grabs the reader’s attention.</li><li>Appropriately frame and position the topic in relevant background work. Specifically, briefly describe relevant insights or findings from coursework, practitioner articles, or academic research.

The peer group and instructor marks will account for 30% and 70% of the overall mark, respectively. At the same time, I retain the right to make adjustments and finalize the presentation grade. Each group’s mark out of 100 will be converted to a share of <strong>15 %</strong> of the course grade, the weight assigned to this group presentation component of your teamwork. </p><p>You will have the <u>option</u> to submit a peer evaluation or report non-performing team member(s). If you do <u>not</u> provide this information, the instructor assumes that all group members contributed fairly to the project and presentation. You can share the peer evaluation/report immediately after your group presentation. This group paper presentation assignment is worth 40% of your final grade. There is <strong>a 10% per day late penalty. There are no make-ups for this assignment. Marks will be deducted for presentations that exceed 12 minutes.</strong></p>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Fair Contingencies for Emergency Remote Teaching</strong><br/>The course outline presents the instructor’s intentions for course assessments, their weights, and due dates. We will keep to the specified assessments, weights, and dates as best as possible. To provide a contingency for unforeseen circumstances, the instructor reserves the right to modify course topics, assessments, weight, and deadlines with due and fair notice to students. In such challenges, the instructor will work with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect the rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty. </p><p><strong>Attendance Policy</strong></p><p>This course has an attendance policy that is strictly enforced. If you miss a negotiation exercise, you must contact the instructor well before the scheduled class that will be impacted. You may miss one negotiation exercise without penalty if you provide the required notice in advance. Failure to do so will result in a drop of one letter grade for the course. Further, failure to participate in more than one exercise (regardless of notice) will result in a decline of one letter grade for the course. If you miss a class in which role assignments are distributed, you must make arrangements to get the materials. Without your initiative, the instructor assumes no responsibility for notifying you or getting the materials to you. This strict policy is necessary because your classmates rely on your attendance for their educational experience. The instructor must also arrange logistics and pairings before each negotiation exercise.</p><p><strong>Honour Code</strong></p><p>A strict honour code applies to this class as follows:</p><p>You may not make up facts that materially change the power distribution or a negotiation exercise (e.g., your family just bought the company you are currently negotiating, or state that you can’t grant a request because it is illegal when this isn’t the case). If you are asked a question that calls for information not in your confidential instructions, you may say, “I don’t know.”</p><p>You may tell the other side what you wish, but you may not, under any circumstances, show them your confidential role instructions.</p><ul><li>You may not borrow notes, discuss cases, or share quizzes and assignments with people not taking the class.</li><li>To get the most out of this class, everybody must feel free to share openly. To help make our class a “safe space,” class discussion is expected to stay in this class. Students must never look at another student’s journal entry without the writer’s explicit permission.</li><li>Material used in this class, including but not limited to handouts, exercises, cases, discussion questions, charts, and graphs, are copyrighted and, hence, may not be used for purposes other than the education experience of this class without the written consent of the instructor.</li></ul><p><strong>Late Assignments</strong></p><p>Late assignments will not be accepted.</p><p> </p>
