<p><i>More information about all of the assessment components of the course will be discussed in class and posted on LEARN throughout the term. </i></p><p><strong><u>LABORATORY</u></strong></p><p><i><strong>All labs</strong></i> must be attended and completed to successfully pass the course. If for some unforeseen reason you cannot attend a lab, you must get in touch with Jen BEFORE you miss the lab.</p><p>While a collaborative spirit is encouraged in carrying out laboratory assignments, submitted work must be completed individually. It is unacceptable in this course to have or share hard copies or digital copies of laboratories completed in previous years.</p><p>Labs are due promptly at the beginning of the lab. If anything is handed in late a 10% per day penalty will be applied, to a maximum of 5 days. No late assignment will be accepted, regardless of how many days late it is, once marked assignments have been handed back to the rest of the class or answer keys have been posted. </p><p><strong>LABORATORY FINAL EXAM (15%): </strong>If the laboratory final is missed due to illness or extenuating circumstances, please notify Jen as soon as possible. Supporting documentation is required to be submitted to the Instructor (Jen) within 24 hrs, and to the Science Undergrad office 48hrs. Such documentation can include a Verification of Illness Forms (VIF), a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-my-illness"><u>Quest self-declaration</u></a>, counseling letters, death certificates for funerals attended, etc. A make-up final will be scheduled when appropriate. More Information about filling out a VIF, and accommodations for illness or extenuating circumstances in the Science faculty can be found here: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances</u></a></p><p><strong>PROJECT: </strong>More detail will be provided about the project during the term. Plagiarism detection software (Turnitin) will be used to screen the projects you hand in in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all materials and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course. If you do not wish to have your work submitted to Turnitin, you need to inform Jen Parks by Friday, January 31<sup>st</sup>, 2025. At that time, reasonable options will be discussed between the student and Jen Parks as to what alternative arrangements will be made. </p><p><strong><u>LECTURE</u></strong></p><p><strong>QUIZZES (15%)</strong> Module quizzes are worth 15% of your final mark (5 quizzes total, 3% each). Questions will include matching, multiple choice and calculations. You have up unlimited attempts on each quiz and we will keep the highest mark. You will be able to see your mark as soon as you complete the quiz as well as the answers to the questions. There is a pool of randomly selected questions on the quiz, so you will not see the same quiz twice. The quiz will remain active until the end of each module (dates specified on LEARN) at which point we will retain the highest quiz mark for your course score. </p><p><strong><u>POPULAR SCIENCE ASSIGNMENT (10%):</u></strong> Individually, prepare a popular science summary of a recent peer-reviewed scientific article on metamorphism (within the last 3 years) targeted to the general public. This is due on<strong> <u>February 28</u></strong>, by midnight to the LEARN dropbox. Details will be provided on the LEARN site. </p><p><strong>FINAL EXAM (25%):</strong> A comprehensive final exam will be scheduled and administered by the University of Waterloo. </p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>GenAI is not permitted in the weekly lab assignments and the lab project. <strong>GenAI can be used in the Popular Science assignment</strong>. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
