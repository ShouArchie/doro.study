  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>EARTH 270:</div>
<p>The course will examine the physical causes and affects of natural disasters including landslides, snow avalanches, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, subsidence, volcanic eruptions, and asteroid impacts. Illustrated by case histories, the course will analyze the factors that lead to disasters. The effect of climate change, human activity, and population growth on the magnitude and frequency of disasters will be explored. The course will introduce the basic principles of Geo-Risk management and its applications in natural hazards engineering, in the development of mitigation strategies and in the re-insurance industry.</p>

<h3>Expectation of Student Commitment to the Course</h3><p>This is an undergraduate level course, and I will not be policing your study habits, I expect each student to keep up with the lecture content, readings, and any posted material within LEARN. I estimate that 2 additional hours will be required each week for our class, to review notes as well as reading from the assigned readings (course modules, PDFs, or linked readings on LEARN), which is essential to making both the content easier to understand, doing well in the online quizzes, and also to achieve the highest grades in the course. As this is an online course, your time management skills and positive motivation are vital to completing all the tasks by the due dates and a good final grade.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4><strong>Course Content Warning</strong></h4><p>This online course involves viewing, reading, and discussing natural hazard processes and disasters that may directly or indirectly impact humans in a negative way.  Some students may find specific hazards/disasters disturbing or even traumatizing, as such, you are encouraged to prepare yourself emotionally before studying the material.  If you believe that you will find a certain part of this course too difficult to engage with, please contact the instructor to provide an alternate learning option as you will still be responsible for understanding all of the course material.</p><h4><strong>Late Policy</strong></h4><p>All term work (i.e., Quizzes, Discussion posts, and Assignments) submitted after the due date given on the Course Schedule will receive a score of zero. It is YOUR responsibility to understand and follow the course schedule and meet all posted due dates. Accommodations <i><strong>may be given</strong></i> for valid and documented reasons, but students <strong>must complete the 2-step process described below:</strong></p><ol><li>Email the course instructor <strong>within 24 hours</strong> of the missed work due date.<ul><li>Please note emails can be received 24 hours per day</li><li>Email subject line must include “EARTH270 – Missed Course Work" with your “Full Name” and “Student ID number”. This will alert the instructor to the importance of the email.</li><li>Repeat the above information within the email message with a “brief explanation” of why the work was missed.</li></ul></li><li>Email a copy of and important documentation to the course instructor as soon as possible, and not more than 1 week after the event.<ul><li>Medical Examination <strong>On Campus</strong><ul><li>Print a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness Form </a>(VIF) and bring to medical professional to complete.</li><li>Get examined at the University of Waterloo campus Health Services. Health Services will complete a Verification of Illness form (VIF) for the student.</li><li>Assessment of illness must be based on an actual examination before or within 24 hours of the missed term work rather than an account of how the student felt several days prior.</li></ul></li><li>Medical Examination <strong>Off Campus</strong><ul><li>If the student is ill on a weekend, during off-hours, while out-of-town or receiving ongoing care from a family physician or specialist, it is acceptable to provide documentation from other health service providers</li><li>Information should include date of physician assessment, dates of illness, level of incapacitation and whether the diagnosis was made by the physician or based on description by the student.</li><li>If the student does not have the University of Waterloo's VIF with them at the time they are seen by the external health service provider, or the documentation provided does not include the required information, the student will need to return and have them complete and sign the VIF. (Please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/student-support/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Accommodation for illness or extenuating circumstances</a> for additional information)</li><li>Please note instructors may contact physicians or academic advisers to verify student illness.</li></ul></li><li>Situation where VIFs are not Appropriate<ul><li>For other extenuating circumstances that are not illness related, for which the Verification of Illness Form is not appropriate, official documented proof that something serious has occurred will be required (<i>consult with the instructor</i>). It is understood that sometimes events occur beyond the student’s control so if in doubt, contact the course instructor if the student has a compelling reason. But it is the student’s responsibility to provide valid supporting evidence in writing.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><h4><strong>Use of Generative AI</strong></h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will be discussed in class.</p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai">ChatGPT and Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) – Research Guides at University of Waterloo</a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. Therefore, it is your responsibility to double-check all AI outputs you wish to build upon in your project. Do not just assume it’s always correct!</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">Generative Artificial Intelligence – University of Waterloo</a>.</p><p>You will be accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><h4><strong>Group Work/Collaboration</strong></h4><p>There is groupwork in this course. Group work is a beneficial practice, both for your ability to learn within a course and as a practical skill later in your career. However, it is important to remember that any group work or collaboration needs to be consistent with your instructor’s guidelines, and these guidelines may be different in each assignment or course. Please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/integrity-students/group-work">Group Work resource for students</a> for more tips on working in groups.</p><h4><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></h4><p>The educational materials developed for this course are the intellectual property of the course instructor and other copyright holders.

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
