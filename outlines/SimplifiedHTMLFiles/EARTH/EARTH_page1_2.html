<p>Instructor Information: Dr. Madeline (Maddy) Rosamond</p><p>I hold a PhD in Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences from the University of Waterloo (2014) and an HBSc in Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences from McMaster University (2006). My research specialty is biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus, two key nutrients that can cause algal blooms in aquatic ecosystems, with a focus on production and emission of nitrous oxide (a powerful greenhouse gas) from streams and rivers.</p><p>My real passion is teaching, with a focus on (a) active learning (hands-on opportunities, field days, samples brought to class), (b) mathematical approaches to science questions, and (c) problem solving with real data.</p><p>I like dreaming up interesting questions for students, hiking, biking, and hanging with my partner and toddler.</p><p>You might notice I'm looking pretty pregnant! I'm conveniently due on April 27 BUT in the unlikely even that I have a baby really early, the excellent Dr. Keith Delaney (who has taught this class for many years) will step in at the end. You will recognize Keith if you wish to watch the pandemic-era videos. Thanks, Keith!</p><p>Announcements</p><p>Your instructor (Dr. Maddy Rosamond) will post written <strong>Announcements</strong> on the main <strong>Course Home</strong> page throughout the term to communicate new or changing information regarding the course content, media links, due dates, instructor absence, etc., as needed.

<div>
<p><strong>Missed Work: </strong>If you miss work due to illness or other extenuating circumstance, please fill out the appropriate form (e.g. VIF, short-term absence, etc.) following these guidelines: https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-other-extenuating-circumstances. It is your responsibility to contact the instructor within 24 hours if you have missed any work, in order to determine how to make it up.</p><p>Please note that these forms are NOT accepted for Quizzes <strong>unless </strong>you are absent for the entire time the Quiz is open. However, we drop your lowest Quiz score and use only the top 8 scores.</p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><h2>LEARN Data Use and Privacy</h2><p>The Science Undergraduate Office (SUO) will collect course assessment and engagement data through LEARN to assist with student support activities. You may be contacted by the SUO, or myself, if we have concerns about your academic progression this term.

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
