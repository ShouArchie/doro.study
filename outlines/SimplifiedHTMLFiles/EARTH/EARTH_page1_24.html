</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>EARTH 456:</div>
<p>An introduction to the theory and practice of groundwater flow and contaminant transport modeling. Topics related to variably-saturated flow will focus on derivation of Richard's equation, a control volume finite difference discretization, assembly and solution of the flow equation, material balance error, truncation error analysis, stability and monotonicity. Topics related to contaminant transport will focus on derivation of the contaminant transport equation, a control volume finite difference discretization along with various spatial and temporal weighting schemes and their associated accuracy, monotonicity, and material balance error. Hands-on experience is provided using software applied to industry-standard variably-saturated flow and transport problems, with an emphasis on visualization and interpretation of results.</p>

<p><strong>Assignments</strong>: There are a total of five assignments distributed every two weeks (approximately). One week notice will be provided before each assignment is handed out.</p><p><strong>Final Exam</strong>: TBD</p><p><strong>Marks</strong>: If the arithmetic mean grade on your assignments is greater than 75% and your final exam mark exceeds the arithmetic mean grade of your assignment marks, you will graded under Option 2. Otherwise, you are graded under Option 1. Note that there is no midterm in this course. Also, each of the five assignments has equal weight towards how your assignment mark is calculated. If an assignment is handed in late, a penalty will be assigned by the marker. If an assignment is not handed in, a mark of "0.0%" will be given to the assignment. If you miss the final exam without an acceptable reason (as evaluated by the Faculty of Science undergraduate office), a mark of "0.0%" will be given towards the exam grade. Student travel is not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time.</p><p><strong>Contribution (Bonus): </strong>This component is designed to encourage and reward collaboration among peers, fostering a supportive and interactive learning environment. The total maximum bonus points that can be earned across all five assignments is five. Students can earn bonus points by actively participating in discussions or helping their peers understand the course material and assignments. However, <strong>sharing copies of assignments between peers is strictly prohibited</strong>.</p><p><strong>Slip Days</strong>: Students are allowed <strong>two slip days</strong>, during which you can submit your assignment within <strong>three days (by the end of Friday)</strong>. These slip days provide flexibility in meeting deadlines. <u>If one or both slip days are not used, one or two points will be added to the contribution points.</u></p><p><strong>How Contribution Points are Awarded</strong>:</p><ul><li>Students who contribute significantly to collaborative efforts will receive bonus points.</li><li>Contributions can include but are not limited to:<ul><li>Sharing helpful insights or solutions in class discussions or forums.</li><li>Offering guidance to peers on assignments or problem-solving.</li><li>Explaining a challenging concept to peers in a collaborative study session.</li><li>Offering constructive feedback on a peer’s approach to solving a problem.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Criteria for Bonus Points</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Per Assignment</strong>:<ul><li>Students who make <strong>more than five contributions</strong> related to a single assignment will receive one bonus point.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cumulative Contributions</strong>:<ul><li>A maximum of five contributions will be allowed per assignment.</li><li>Students who make more than 20 contributions across all assignments will be eligible for an additional five bonus points.</li></ul></li></ol><p> </p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
