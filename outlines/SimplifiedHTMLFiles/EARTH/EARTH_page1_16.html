  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>EARTH 355:</div>
<p>This course explores approaches for interpreting environmental data to support water decisions using theoretical and computational techniques. These approaches focus on statistical methods, including descriptive statistics, probability, hypothesis testing, frequency and time series analyses, point patterns, and correlation and regression, and also include discussion of analytical and numerical approaches.</p>

<p><i>Blended Framework</i></p><p><i><u>Lectures:</u></i> Lecture videos are provided online and asynchronous. Students are expected to have watched the videos prior to class.</p><p><i><u>In-Class Time (Mondays):</u></i> Instructor will briefly review the lecture contents for the week and will lead example questions and in-class activities, working towards the weekly assignment and poster development goal. It is anticipated that there will be time during class to work on these activities with the instructor present.</p><p><i><u>In-Class Time (Wednesday):</u></i> Any additional review for the week’s lecture contents will be completed. In addition, approximately one case study will be provided each week as reading material with an instructor led discussion during this time. The instructor will lead a discussion on the case study, and the remainder of the time will be to answer questions on this and other course content (assignments, coding labs).</p><p><i><u>Assignments/Labs:</u></i> Assignments from weeks 1 – 10 (no assignment during week 9) will include calculations by hand, and a coding lab component (coding component is included in week 9).</p><p><strong>EXPECTED *</strong><i><strong>AVERAGE* </strong></i><strong>WEEKLY TIME COMMITMENT:</strong> 8 – 10 hours</p>

These are coding programs that work in Windows, Mac, and Linux. We will use them through Jupyter Notebook, accessible online through UW’s Jupyter server. Full instructions for use provided in course. <i>If you prefer to use MATLAB or similar, we will happily mark your assignments but may not be able to provide help or scripts for any other program.</i></p><p>There are no late penalties for assignments or labs that are submitted prior to marks being posted and assignments returned, which is expected to be <i>ONE WEEK after due date</i>. Assignments will not be graded once marks are posted and they are returned, but can be submitted to check for correctness if the instructor/TA has time available.</p><p><strong>IN-CLASS ACTIVITIES:</strong></p><p>For the in-class activities, you will be given a worksheet to solve a problem related to the topic of discussion. The worksheets will be peer-marked, following solutions provided in class. Only the top 6 in-class activities will count towards your final grade, and no make-up activities will be provided.</p><p><strong>POSTER DRAFT REVIEW:</strong></p><p>For the assignments/labs you will have ‘adopted’ a dataset and performed several statistical analyses on this dataset. You will work with a partner on the final project, but must develop a unique, initial poster draft for your data. The poster draft will include the introduction, hypothesis/objective, and presentation and description of your data. The draft will be peer-marked using a rubric provided on LEARN.</p><p><strong>FINAL PROJECT POSTER:</strong></p><p>For the assignments/labs you will have ‘adopted’ a dataset and performed several statistical analyses on this dataset. You will work with one other student on the final poster, selecting one of your two datasets and decisions to present. The final project is a poster presenting a decision to be made based on this dataset (determined by you, in consultation with the instructor), the methods and analyses used to support this decision, and a recommendation to the stakeholder (the person for whom the decision is made for). These should be one page.</p><p>The datasets and the analyses are unique to each student. Please see Academic Integrity below for further details.</p><p>More information, including a grading rubric, is available on the class LEARN site.</p><p>There are no late penalties for a final poster that is submitted on or before the last day of class. Starting on the day after the last day of classes, a late penalty will be applied of 10% (1 day late), 25% (2 days late), 50% (3 days late), 75% (4 days late), and 100% (5 days late).</p><p><strong>FINAL EXAM:</strong></p><p>There is a final exam for this course. It will cover the entire contents of the course but will not include a coding component. There will be one open question where you will be asked to discuss a perspective of one of the case studies we covered in class. More information will be provided throughout the term.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) may be used to screen posters in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
