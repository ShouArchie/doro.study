  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The Introduction to Rock Mechanics course will repeatedly emphasize to the student the importance of understanding limitations and risks that must be managed in a Professional context, including issues such as responsibilities and ethics in design and reporting (Read the additional document on Information Sources and Ethics)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The design process in Geomechanics will be outlined as a process of risk management and continual design and project outcomes improvement</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The student will be expected to qualitatively and semi-quantitatively understand uncertainty, probability and risk in RM work, including uncertainties related to properties and measurements, estimation and measuring conditions at depth, limited sampling issues, inference as to the interior state of the rockmass, representativeness and related issues</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The student will learn to appreciate the importance of Earth Stresses and how to measure or estimate them, and be able to do depth and stress-pressure calculations</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The student will leave the course with a deep appreciation of the role of flaws (microcracks, pores, bedding planes, joints, fractures, faults…) in governing real rock behavior at all scales from the tiny laboratory specimen to the large Fault scale</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It is an expectation that the student knows what deformation-based design is and how to estimate and measure the deformability of rock at all scales from the laboratory to the field, for Civil, Mining and Petroleum Engineering applications, including foundations design, prediction compaction behavior</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A basic comprehension of Yield and “Failure” of rock specimens and rock masses, including failure mechanisms, the yield behavior of joints, dilation, Mohr-Coulomb yield criteria, ultimate strength, use of Mohr-Coulomb diagrams to evaluate strength and proximity to strain-weakening yield, is expected as part of the design environment in rock mechanics</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What is rheological modelling and its role in breaking down complex stress-strain-yield constitutive behavior into simpler elements to help understand the elements of constitutive laws and physics? What are the basic mechanics and physics of creep in rock and rock masses (with some emphasis on salt mechanics)?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Doing slope stability analysis using limiting equilibrium of forces methods, including understanding how to incorporate forces arising from pore pressures, earthquake loading, self-weight, tensioned cables, and other factors into slope stability assessment. Geological factors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Introducing Reservoir Rock Mechanics issues, i.e.: deep subsurface geomechanics, so the student appreciates borehole stability, compaction/subsidence, stress redistributions and stress value changes from thermal or pore pressure changes, based on linear elastic Hooke’s Law applications to simple boundary value problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Introduction to stress concentrations arising around circular openings and other structures in RM, using the Kirsch equations for stresses around a circular borehole. Students are introduced to this analysis for first-order estimates of borehole yield, and sequenced/observational methods for tunneling in naturally jointed rock masses are introduced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Calculating effective stress changes and proximity to strain-weakening yield based on stress and yield criterion analysis</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Although the course does not involve mathematical modeling (numerical simulation) directly, everyone in RM areas and other engineering domains will be using numerical modeling approaches in their careers. Hence, a brief introduction to some of the more common approaches used in RM engineering will be described in broad terms. The concept of THMC coupling will be introduced</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Introduction to some special topics will be undertaken in the final several lectures to help open the student to interesting development and directions in Geomechanics. For example, shale gas and shale oil geoengineering, CO2 sequestration, and geothermal energy are important emerging areas that are rich in RM issues</td>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
