<p>The format of the final exam will be run digitally through the LEARN Quiz system in the last week of the course, not during the formal exam period. Expect a series of True/False, Multiple Choice, and/or similar type questions. To keep the academic integrity of the course, you will NOT be able to move back and forth through the Exam questions or pages, it is a linear progression through the test. This is to prevent the easiest methods of cheating available. All course work will count towards your final grade, and only exceptions will be made via a proper and accepted <strong>Verification of Illness or Student Declaration</strong> form and instructor consent.</p><ul><li>The Final Exam will cover <strong>the entire course</strong> from the first to last lab.</li><li>As the Final Exam will be held online through the LEARN Quiz system, it will also be an 'open-book' exam.</li><li>More details will be provided as we get closer to the end of term.</li></ul><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h2>LATE POLICY</h2><p>Your marks will be based on weekly lab assignments and a final exam. Assignments <strong>must be finished by the end of your lab session</strong> and submitted to your lab TA or proper Dropbox within our LEARN site.  Assignments not submitted to your TA or the Dropbox in time will not be accepted, and a <strong><u>late deduction could be applied</u></strong>.</p><p>Late deductions are typically -5% per day.</p><p><strong>No lab assignments will be accepted after 1 Week Late without a VIF or acceptable documentation</strong>.</p><p>Alternative arrangements for missed labs will be granted only in cases where the student provides an acceptable Verification of Illness Form or Student Declaration or has consent from the instructor. Please contact the course instructor asap if you think you will miss a lab!</p><p>Accommodations <i><strong>may be given</strong></i> for valid and documented reasons but students <u>must complete the 2 step process described below:</u></p><ol><li>Email the course instructor <strong>within 24 hours</strong> of the missed work due date.<ul><li>Please note emails can be received 24 hours per day</li><li>Email subject line must include “Earth 122L – Missed Course Work" with your “Full Name” and “Student ID number”. This will alert me to the importance of the email.</li><li>Repeat the above information within the email message with a<strong> brief explanation</strong> of why the term work was missed.</li></ul></li><li>Email a copy of the documentation to the course instructor within one week.<ol><li>Medical Examination <strong>On Campus</strong><ul><li>Print a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic">Verification of Illness Form </a>(VIF) and bring to medical professional to complete or fill out the online Student Declaration form.</li><li>Get examined at the University of Waterloo campus Health Services. Health Services will complete a Verification of Illness form (VIF) for the student.</li><li>Assessment of illness must be based on an actual examination before or within 24 hours of the missed term work rather than an account of how the student felt several days prior.</li><li>These can be completed <strong>digitally </strong>now!</li></ul></li><li>Medical Examination <strong>Off Campus</strong><ul><li>If the student is ill on a weekend, during off-hours, while out-of-town or receiving ongoing care from a family physician or specialist, it is acceptable to provide documentation from other health service providers</li><li>Information should include date of physician assessment, dates of illness, level of incapacitation and whether the diagnosis was made by the physician or based on description by the student.</li><li>If the student does not have the University of Waterloo's VIF with them at the time they are seen by the external health service provider, or the documentation provided does not include the required information, the student will need to return and have them complete and sign the VIF. This official verification is necessary before any action can be taken and can be downloaded from the Health Services website.</li><li>Please note instructors may contact physicians to verify student illness.</li></ul></li><li>Situation where VIFs are not Appropriate<ul><li>For other extenuating circumstances that are not illness related, for which the Verification of Illness Form is not appropriate, official documented proof that something has occurred will be required (<i>consult with the instructor</i>). It is understood that sometimes events occur beyond the student’s control so if in doubt, contact the course instructor if the student has a compelling reason. But it is the student’s responsibility to provide valid supporting evidence in writing.</li></ul></li></ol></li></ol><p> </p><h2>LEARN Data Use and Privacy</h2><p>The Science Undergraduate Office (SUO) will collect course assessment and engagement data through LEARN to assist with student support activities.

Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

If you use any generative AI in assignments or lab reports, you MUST cite that you used it. </p><p>Example citations:</p><p>"Lab Report 1 by Student LastName</p><p>Note: ChatGPT Version X was used for editing answers 1.1 through 1.11."</p><p>or "Studies have found that air pollution can lead to various illnesses such as cancer (OpenAI, 2025)" with the reference at the bottom like this:</p><p>"References</p><p>OpenAI.

It's probably just faster and more accurate to do a web search and pick a reputable website, e.g. a university, government, or scientific article page.]</p><p> </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
