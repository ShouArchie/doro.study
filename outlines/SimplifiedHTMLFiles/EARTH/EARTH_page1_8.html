<p><strong>LECTURES</strong></p><p>Please expect to allocate an average of 4 hours per week to review powerpoint slides and attend lectures. Each of the four assignments should take 3 hours to complete. The rock poster will take ~10-15 hours to complete.</p><p><u>Assignments:</u> There are four lecture assignments. Two focus on phase diagrams (long answer) and two have multiple choice review questions for each half of the course. Assignments may be submitted as a paper copy or electronically to the assignment's LEARN dropbox by the start of class on the due date. The due dates are February 6 (phase diagram), February 25 (multiple choice), March 11 (phase diagram), and April 4 (multiple choice). </p><p><u>Rock Poster:</u> Each student will prepare a poster on a rock type chosen by the student. Each rock type can only be claimed by one student. See "Rock Poster" document on LEARN for more information regarding poster content and formatting. The due date for the rock poster is March 25 and the poster should be submitted to a Discussion Forum on LEARN. </p><p><u>Final Exam:</u> The closed-book final exam will be in-person and scheduled by the registrar. Materials to be studied for the final exam are the lecture modules, powerpoint slides, and lecture assignments. </p><p> </p><p><strong>LABORATORY</strong></p><p>The Laboratory part of this course will be held in EIT 1009. The lab portion of the course is worth 40% of your mark and is assigned by the instructor. Your lab mark will be a combination of Pre-lab Quizzes, weekly Lab Assignments, and a Lab Final Exam held at the end of the term during your scheduled lab session. Each week you will be expected to review assigned content, complete a pre-lab quiz, and submit an assignment. Please refer to the “Earth 232 Lab Info and Schedule.pdf” on Learn for more information about the lab component of the course, including a more specific breakdown of the lab mark. You MUST hand in all of the laboratory assignments in order to pass the course. While a collaborative spirit is encouraged in carrying out laboratory assignments, submitted work must be completed individually. It is also unacceptable in this course to have or share paper copies or digital copies of laboratories completed in previous years.</p><p> </p><p><strong>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY REMINDER</strong></p><p>While a collaborative spirit is encouraged in completing lecture and laboratory assignments, submitted work must be completed individually. It is unacceptable in this course to possess or share hard copies or digital copies of lecture assignments, laboratory assignments, or rock posters / presentations completed in previous years. Students are reminded that copying material word-for-word from other students constitutes plagiarism and is subject to disciplinary action according to Policy 71. Plagiarism of any published literature or GenAI on lecture and laboratory assessment activities is an academic offense and subject to Policy 71. Always paraphrase information from the literature in your own words.</p><p> </p><p><strong>MISSED ASSESSMENT DATES</strong></p><p>Students have three options to declare an absence during the Winter 2025 term:</p><p>a. Self-declared short-term absence: for absences up to 2 calendar days during the Formal Lecture Period due to any reason that prevents a student from meeting their academic obligations (except the laboratory; this does not qualify for accommodation as a result of a self-declared short-term absence); one short-term absence is permitted per term; no documentation is required.</p><p>b. Self-declared Covid-19-related absence: for absences up to 10 days due to Covid-19-related illness (including vaccination side effects) or a requirement to self-isolate; one self-declared absence is permitted per term; no documentation is required.</p><p>c. VIF declaration: for absences that do not meet the short-term absence criteria, for self-declared absences that exceed the maximum number permitted per term, or for (retroactive) reports of illness or other extenuating circumstances; students must refer to their home Faculty's process for VIF submissions.</p><p><u>In-Term Assessments:</u><strong> </strong>If a deadline is missed due to illness or extenuating circumstances (e.g., family death, vehicle accident), please notify Brian (lecture) or Sana (lab) as soon as possible. If illness-related, either declare a short-term absence or electronically submit VIF documentation to the Science Undergraduate Office. Please contact Brian regarding how to makeup missed deadlines for lecture assignments and the rock poster. Please contact Sana regarding how to makeup missed deadlines for lab assignments/quizzes. Otherwise, late assessments will be penalized 10% per day late, including weekend days. No late assignment will be accepted, regardless of how many days late it is, once marked assignments have been handed back to the rest of the class.    </p><p><u>Final Exams:</u> If a final exam is missed due to illness or extenuating circumstances (e.g., family death, vehicle accident), please notify Brian (lecture) or Sana (lab) as soon as possible. If illness-related, electronically submit VIF documentation to the Science Undergraduate Office. Please contact Sana to arrange a new date and time to write the final laboratory exam. Students are expected to write the lecture final exam during a makeup final exam session offered by the Registrar's Office.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as synthesis and poster presentation of information on a student's chosen rock type, and laboratory mineral and rock descriptions. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

You should expect an equal opportunity to learn. You are also expected to behave fairly and respectfully toward everyone else and avoid behaviours that make it harder for others to be comfortable. Everyone in this course has equally earned their place. Please help to create a welcoming and inclusive environment by, for example, refraining from discussing a person’s appearance or making assumptions based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or other personal characteristics. If you have a concern about how you are being treated, some of the people you can contact include (in order of escalating seriousness): your instructor, the current Chair of the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, the University of Waterloo’s Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Office at svpro@uwaterloo.ca or the police on- or off-campus.</p><p> </p><p><strong>CAMPUS AND CLASSROOM SAFETY: EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS</strong></p><p>All students are strongly encouraged to download the WatSAFE app and be familiar with emergency preparedness guidelines available at https://uwaterloo.ca/emergency-planning/emergency-preparedness/violent-person-campus-know-you-can-survive. If someone is committing violence or about to commit violence at the university, then remember the three essential courses of action to help you avoid harm:</p><p><strong>GET OUT:</strong> Getting out is by far the best option if you believe you can escape safely. This is why it is a good idea to make mental notes of means of escape wherever you may be on campus. If you hear something that could be gunshots, don’t wait: get out.</p><p><strong>HIDE:</strong> Hide if you don’t know exactly where the shooting is happening or it’s too late to escape safely. Get behind a lockable door if you can. Barricade the door. Improvise with any object you can to prevent someone from entering. Once you are hidden, silence your phone, turn off the lights and stay quiet. If your spot is secure, be prepared to remain there until the police come to you with the all clear.</p><p><strong>FIGHT:</strong> Fighting is your absolute last resort. You would only confront a violent or armed intruder if you somehow became trapped in a space with no escape. A violent or armed intruder typically doesn’t respond to reason so you must assume they intend to harm you. Find an object you can use to strike the attacker with; trip them with a chair; be as aggressive as you can; do anything you can to stop them.</p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
