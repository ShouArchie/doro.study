  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>EARTH 438:</div>
<p>Review of basic concepts in engineering geology as applied to rock and soil, including material properties, variability in properties, external factors such as stress, and evaluation of design adequacy. Site investigation and characterization techniques used to define and characterize the properties of geological materials and their use in selected engineering geologic design and construction problems. Laboratory assignments will focus on the determination of physical properties and site assessment problems.</p>

<div>
<div>EARTH 638:</div>
<p>Time dependent behaviour of rocks, Griffiths crack theory, failure criteria for rocks, in situ stresses and their origins, behaviour of discontinuous rock masses, introductions to analytic and numerical methods for rock mechanics. Case studies, term project.</p>

<p>Project themes selected for EARTH 438, which provides the subject for the Team Project and Presentation, since 2010 has been The Engineering Geology of Open Pit Mining which has proved popular with both Civil and Geological Engineers as well as Geoscientists, since many students taking the course target careers in the resource extraction industry or its peripheral connections. The course is global in scope.</p><p><i>*Graduate students enrolling in EARTH 638 will be required to complete 1 additional project on top of the EARTH 438 coursework. This project can be parallel or supporting their graduate research themes.</i></p>

  Learning Outcomes

<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Describe the relationship between geology and the design and performance of engineered structures (buildings, dams, slopes, tunnels, excavations, and infrastructure) as well as the implications of damaging geological processes for the siting and security of engineering facilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Understand basic concepts in engineering geology as applied to rock and soil such as material properties, variability in properties, the role of external factors such as stress history, evaluation of design quality in the context of geology and geological processes, site investigation and field techniques used to characterize the mass properties of geological materials, and their use in engineering geology inputs into the design and construction process</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Discuss geological hazards as they impact on project feasibility and integrity, including an examination of engineering geology and risk</td>

<p><strong>Labs </strong>will consist of five (5) assignments including i) Site evaluation using RMR/DMR for a hydroelectric facility, ii) 2 Stereonet analysis assignments, iii) Time-to-Failure analysis using the inverse-velocity method, iv) Hazard and Risk assessment of a debris flow and seismic event.</p><p><strong>Midterm</strong> will be entirely based on Stereonet analysis</p><p><strong>Project </strong>will be a group project of a selected mine site. The objectives are to summarize geological conditions and structural setting of the mine, to outline geohazard exposure for slope design (e.g., seismicity), identify key engineering geological problems in pit slope stability (including failure types, failure mechanisms, and failure mitigation), and to discuss issues related to the stability and characteristics of associated waste dumps and/or tailings. Students must also discuss engineering geology aspects of mine-access infrastructure construction and maintenance and outline a risk assessment for site hazards (e.g., seismicity). Finally, lessons learned for site characterization, design, and operations should be outlined.</p><p><strong>Term Test</strong> will be held on Friday, April 4th, 2025, during the final lab session of the term and will cover course content, but will not require stereonet backing boards or tracing paper. It will be entirely written. A 1-letter-sized-page, single-sided, handwritten cheat sheet will be allowed during the term test. There is no Final Exam held during the Final Exam period. </p>

<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
