  Instructor &amp; TA (Teaching Assistant) Information
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Dr. Madeline (Maddy) Rosamond (she/her)</p><p>About me: I love teaching and geochemistry! My PhD was completed in 2014 in nitrogen cycling and use of stable isotopes to understand N cycling in the Grand River, Ontario. Earth 221 was actually the first course I ever taught and still kind of my favourite (don't tell my other courses!). You might notice I am looking pretty pregnant! I am conveniently due April 30, but in the unlikely event I have a baby very early, the excellent Alex Kunert (she/her), a PhD candidate here in the EES department, will take over. Alex is a great teacher and has taught this class before. Thanks, Alex!</p><p>msrosamo@uwaterloo.ca</p><p>EIT 2051D. To find this, go to the main Earth Sci office and continue all the way to the back room. I'm the last door around the large cubicle area.</p><p>Office hours: by appointment as few students are available at the same time!</p><p><strong>TA:</strong> Holly Grierson, holly.grierson@uwaterloo.ca</p><p> </p><p>Contact: You can contact the instructor and/or the TA the Ask the Instructor forum on Learn, during office hours or by email. <strong>Please put Earth 221 in your email subject line.</strong></p>

<p>Lectures will supply you with the base knowledge to complete quizzes, assignments, and exams.</p><p><u>There are no required textbooks or materials for this course</u>, but there are suggested readings that will help you immensely throughout the term. Many are in course reserves and some are freely available online.</p><p>No one geochemistry textbook is perfect for this class (maybe one day I'll write one) but my two favourites are Misra for the first part of the class, and Eby for the second. Misra is aimed at more upper year students so you may find some of it too detailed, but it has really great figures.</p><p><strong>For info on how to access course reserves: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/services/course-reserves-students"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/library/services/course-reserves-students</u></a></p>

<p><strong>Participation</strong></p><p>This grade includes:</p><p>- Three surveys (one about your interests, a stop/start/continue one partway through the term, and one about the field day and blended learning activity) (0.5% each for 1.5%)</p><p>- Three study quizzes (a review of prereqs and the syllabus, a midterm and exam study quiz) done on Learn. You can try these quizzes up to 3 times and Learn will take your highest mark (0.5% each for 1.5%)</p><p>- Attendance at the field day and at the presentations (2% total)</p><p><strong>Assignments</strong></p><p>These must be completed using a graphing/spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel) where stated. Please hand in either as a Word Doc (.docx) or PDF (.pdf) to the appropriate dropbox on Learn. Assignments are individual. You are welcome to work with your friend(s) but you must hand in a unique assignment, i.e answers must be <strong>in your own words</strong>.</p><p><strong>Group Oral Presentations</strong></p><p>In groups of 4, you will present the findings of a recent scientific paper that includes some geochemistry. The idea here is to connect what you've learned in class with any other geochemistry you need to learn to make the paper understandable and interesting to your peers. More detail can be found on Learn under Content --&gt; Group Oral Presentation. Presentations are graded by the instructor or TA (50% of your grade) and the class (averaged class score, 50% of your grade) using a rubric. You will be amazed how similar the two grades will be!</p><p><strong>Midterm</strong></p><p>The midterm covers the first half of the class and is written during class or tutorial time. It is a closed book test. Typical question types may be multiple choice, interpreting diagrams, explaining concepts, and doing calculations (equations provided). A periodic table is included. The students will vote on the midterm day as there are many programs represented and I don't know all your schedules.</p><p><strong>Final Exam</strong></p><p>The final exam is scheduled by the Registrar's office. Please do not book any travel plans until you see your exam schedule. It is a cumulative, closed-book test with similar question types to the midterm. Equations are provided and you should definitely bring a calculator.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen the plain language summary assignment in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See University Policy below for more information and links. If your group wishes to opt out of Turnitin, you must let us know by June 30, 2023 so an alternative can be found.

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Late Policy</strong></p><p>Assignments that are handed in late are penalized with -10% per day. Once assignments are handed back by the TA, late ones will no longer be accepted.</p><p>Quizzes and surveys will not be accepted late. (They just disappear from Learn.)</p><p><strong>Extensions and Accommodations</strong></p><p>Extensions and other accommodations will only be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>All communications related to missed work and deadlines should be directed to the instructor or TA by email <strong>as soon as possible</strong>. Requesting an extension for an activity days after its due date is not considered an appropriate request.</p><p>Students have the following three options for declaring an absence. <strong>Students are expected to notify their instructor(s) before or within 24 hours of any deadline for marks. (</strong>This means, you don't need to tell us if you miss class and nothing is due. You DO need to tell us if you miss a deadline such as an assignment, midterm, etc.)</p><p>• Short-term Absence: students can self-declare, through Quest, an absence for 2 calendar days or less, during the Formal Lecture Period; a short-term absence can be self-declared for any reason that prevents a student from meeting their academic obligations, with the exception of Laboratory (LAB) and Clinic (CLN) courses/class components (LAB and CLN courses/class components do not qualify for accommodation as a result of a self-declared short-term absence); students are permitted only one self-declared short-term absence accommodation per academic term; no documentation is required. <strong>Note that Short-term absences are NOT accepted during the final examination period.</strong></p><p>• Covid-19/Influenza-related Absence: students can self-declare, through Quest, an absence for 10 days or less due to Covid-19 related illness (including vaccination side effects) or a requirement to self-isolate; participation in online course elements may be reasonable, and any participation needs to be consistent across all courses; students are permitted only one self-declared Covid-19 related absence accommodation per academic term; no documentation is required.</p><p>• VIF Declaration: for absences that do not meet the short-term absence criteria, for self-declared absences that exceed the maximum number permitted per term, or for (retroactive) reports of illness or other extenuating circumstances, students must refer to their home Faculty's process for VIF submissions (instructions for Science students are found at: https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/accommodation-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submitting).</p><p>o The VIF is the University of Waterloo’s official document to be submitted by students when they are seeking medical accommodation from their instructors. For extenuating circumstances that are not illness related, for which the VIF is not appropriate, other official documentation is necessary (for example: plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors, counsellor letters).</p><p>o Science maintains a page with up-to-date guidelines for Accommodations for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances and can be reviewed as necessary.</p><p><strong>In all cases, you are responsible to contact the instructor and TA as soon as possible (and no later than 24 hours later) to let us know and talk about how to make up your work.</strong></p><p>If you miss an assignment, please follow the procedures above for documenting your absence. If your reason is valid or it's a short-term absence (automatically considered valid), we will discuss an appropriate action in your situation.</p><p>If you miss the midterm test, please follow the procedures above for documenting your absence. If your reason is valid or it's a short-term absence (automatically considered valid), your midterm mark will be deferred to the final examination.</p><p>If you miss the final exam, please follow the procedures above for documenting your absence. Note that short-term absences are not allowed during the exam period. If your reason is valid, you will write the exam during the make-up session.</p><p><strong>Using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) In This Class</strong></p><p>It is possible (and basically, untraceable) to use AIs such at ChatGPT for some work in this course. We will actually examine how good ChatGTP is at geochemistry in one assignment. The rules for Generative AI for are:</p><ol><li><i>Learning objective</i>s: As far as we are able, we have set up the course so AI-generated answers would not receive a passing grade. This means your role is to be specific (AI answers are often vague), accurate, and use your critical thinking in a way AIs cannot.</li><li><i>Referencing and validating</i>. You are taking full responsibility for AI-generated materials as if you had produced them yourself: ideas must be attributed and facts must be true.</li><li><i>Documentation. </i>If you choose to use AI, you must document its use. We will cite ChatGPT (or other AIs) as a personal communication, using APA format: In-text citation:</li></ol><p>In-text citation: (ChatGPT, 2025)</p><p>In reference list: </p><p>ChatGPT. (2025, April 1). How do you cite an answer in ChatGPT. [Response to user question]. Retrieved from [URL of the platform where the conversation took place].</p><p><strong>PLEASE BE AWARE</strong> that you should NOT put other people's work into most GenAI programs as they will be used as training datasets. For example, please do NOT put text of a paper into a GenAI program and ask it to summarize. This is not fair to the authors of the paper. Additionally, do not share anything with a GenAI that you would not be willing the world to know, i.e. your social insurance number, your address, your mental health status, etc.</p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.

<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
