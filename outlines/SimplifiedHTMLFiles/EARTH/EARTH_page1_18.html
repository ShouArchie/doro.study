  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>EARTH 436B:</div>
<p>An optional second term of a two-term supervised research project in which students learn to gather and interpret data. Students will present their findings in a formal presentation and written thesis.</p>
<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>Earth 436B in the Winter term is devoted to the completion of the research activities related to the project, analysis and interpretation of the results, presentation of the results and preparation of a final Research Report. As was the case for the Earth436A course, a progress report must be submitted to your advisor midway through the term to ensure that the research is on track for completion. A detailed class schedule, time frame for all course deliverables and assessment structure are presented below. This schedule and the information in this document may be revised from time to time as the term progresses.</p><p> </p><p>As an initial task in the Earth 436B course, you are required to select a format for the final written report on your BSc research project (<strong>Option A</strong> - Journal Paper Manuscript or <strong>Option B</strong> - Conventional Thesis format). This can be decided through discussions with your advisor. All students will be encouraged to consider formatting their research report as a journal paper with the potential to be submitted for publication consideration to a journal at the end of the course.</p><p> </p><p><strong>OPTION A - Journal Paper Manuscript</strong></p><p>Select an example published paper that is similar in scope to the research topic and has been published in a journal that would be appropriate for the current work. The example paper will act as a detailed guide to follow in preparation of the final report for the Earth 436B course. The example paper will be discussed with and ultimately approved by the advisor.</p><p>Determine the details on what is expected in a journal article format at the selected journal website: (e.g., Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences. https://cdnsciencepub.com/journal/cjes)</p><p>This will include, among other things, information on how to correctly include references, preparation of figures and the inclusion of Supplementary Information if required. This Supplementary Information section is analogous to an Appendix in a conventional thesis format.</p><p>Review in detail the publication expectations with all co-authors who would be included if the work is submitted to a journal (advisors and potentially laboratory technical personnel).</p><p> </p><p><strong>OPTION B - Conventional Thesis</strong></p><p>Obtain a past BSc thesis similar in scope to the research topic to be used as a guide document. The advisor can assist in selecting and providing an appropriate example.</p><p>Consider and discuss the possibility of preparing a journal article based on the research project at a later date.</p><p>Students selecting Option B should refer to and follow the thesis guidelines provided by the University Graduate Office to ensure that the final submitted document follows the standard guidelines for a UW thesis, related to the front pages and document format. These are available at: https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/current-students/thesis</p>

<p><strong>Research Report Format and Outline (Required, no grade weighting): </strong>(<i>Manuscript Option</i>) Submit the selected example journal article and journal website along with a brief outline for your journal paper including each section and the information that will be included in each section in bullet form to the advisor for review and also upload this to the Learn Dropbox on the assigned date. (<i>Thesis Option</i>) Submit a brief outline for the thesis document including each section and the information that will be included in each section in bullet form to the advisor for grading and also upload this to the Learn Dropbox on the assigned date (January 29).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Progress Report (15%):</strong> Progress reports should contain an updated clear statement of goal(s) and objectives of the research, a brief description of methods, an analysis of progress and problems, and a realistic timetable for completion of the remaining stages of the research project. The reports will be <i><u>no longer than 3 pages in length</u></i>, including the clear expected timetable and will be submitted to the advisor for grading and uploaded to the LEARN Dropbox (February 26).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Presentation (35%): </strong>The posters will be presented in one session that will run for an entire day, Wednesday, April 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2025. Each student will select a 15 min time period when a group of Judges will visit the poster and the student will provide a 3 min explanation/presentation of the poster and research. This will be followed by a question-and-answer period. The students are requested to be at their posters to discuss their research and answer questions as much as possible during the day as people will be visiting randomly between 9:00 am and 4:30 pm.  A digital rubric will be made available to everyone visiting the posters as has been done in the past for the final oral presentations. Student participation and assessment with the rubric at the poster presentation session will be required and instructions will be provided later in the course. All assessments will be complied as has been done in the past.</p><p> </p><p><i><strong><u>Poster Printing and Setting up for the Presentation:</u></strong></i> With such a large number of posters to print, the poster will have to be uploaded to the Learn Dropbox in advance of the presentation day (Tuesday, March 25<sup>th</sup>). The posters will all be sent to the UW printing service for printing. The posters will all be mounted for you on assigned presentation boards in the EIT Foyer area (lower floor in the Museum area) by 9:00 am on Wednesday, April 2nd. A PDF of the posters must also be uploaded to the Learn Dropbox <i><strong><u>the night before</u></strong></i> the presentations (April 1<sup>st</sup>).  </p><p>Policies outlined in the Undergraduate Calendar for Academic Regulations Related to Assignments, Tests, and Final Exam Accommodations will be followed (<a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Regulations-Accommodations">https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Regulations-Accommodations</a>). The poster presentation is considered the same as a final examination, and as such policies for a missed final examination apply.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Final Research Document (50%):</strong> A complete draft of your document must be emailed to your advisor at least 1 week before the posted submission due date on LEARN. Your advisor will review the document to ensure proper formatting and completion and may provide edits and comments for implementation prior to final submission.</p><p>Before or on the due date (Wednesday, April 16), you must upload your report to Dropbox for marking by the <i>Advisor</i> and a designated <i>Second Reader</i>. Selection of the second reader is the responsibility of the advisor. A PDF and Word version should be uploaded. If you are unable to complete your document, a draft of all your work completed to date and a realistic schedule for final submission should be shared and discussed with your advisor and uploaded to the Learn page. This will allow your advisor to evaluate how best to help you in this next phase.</p><p>To be fair to all students, extensions will only be allowed in rare and exceptional circumstances by <strong><u>written appeal</u></strong> to the Earth 436B course instructor. If your work is not complete, you must hand in what you have on the due date to your advisor accompanied by a letter of explanation and a revised timetable for completion. The letter of explanation and a revised timetable for completion must also be sent to the course instructor (<a href="mailto:drudolph@uwaterloo.ca">drudolph@uwaterloo.ca</a>). Late submissions may be subject to a 10% penalty, and even delay your degree.</p><p>The advisor is responsible for providing comments in sufficient time so the student can revise the thesis and submit it in final form by the date for mark submission to the Registrar (late April). If you are planning to graduate at the end of term that you are completing your thesis, then you must follow the specified deadlines in order to have everything completed by the dates when the marks for graduating students are due to the registrar.</p><p> </p><p>We are now accepting and storing only electronic copies of Honours BSc Research Reports. These electronic theses will be stored by the library and accessible online. Please upload the final copy of your Report as PDF file to the Dropbox on our LEARN site and send to your advisor. It is IMPORTANT to put <strong><u>YOUR NAME in the file name</u></strong>. Your Research Report will be considered FINAL and will be uploaded to the university library for access by all.</p><p><strong>Note: your final mark WILL NOT be submitted to the Registrar’s Office until we have received an electronic copy of your final Research Report.</strong></p><p>The student and/or advisor can also elect to formally bind the project. The costs for binding may be covered by your advisor. The instructions for binding can be found at:</p><p><a href="https://wstore.uwaterloo.ca/services-resources/printing-binding.html">https://wstore.uwaterloo.ca/services-resources/printing-binding.html</a> <br/> </p><p>Additional copies either formally bound or ring-bound may be needed for collaborators, finding agencies or other students in the laboratory group. Please discuss and arrange binding and copies directly with your advisor.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Turnitin.com: Text matching software (Turnitin®) will be used to screen term papers and assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all materials and sources in assignments is documented. Students will be given an option if they do not want to have their assignment screened by Turnitin® *(e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography plus an interview about their paper or assignment).<br/><br/>Another possibility is the use of the iThenticate software. The procedures for this will be investigated if requests. In the past, the student would need to get his/her own iThenticate account and agree to submit her/his own materials. Graduate students contacted Sean Warren in IST (ext: 46950) to arrange their own iThenticate account.<br/>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>• Office of Academic Integrity provides relevant information for students, faculty and staff. </p><ul><li><strong><u>Academic Integrity</u></strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility</li></ul><p> </p><p>• <strong><u>Plagiarism:</u></strong> Plagiarism is the act of directly copying material from another source word-for-word without acknowledging (citing) the source. Copying material from another student word-for-word (collusion) also constitutes plagiarism. It is unacceptable to claim another person's words as your own. Acts of plagiarism are not tolerated at the University of Waterloo and are subject to disciplinary action according to Policy 71, Student Discipline (see below). If you have not already done so, it is strongly recommended that you take the Academic Integrity Tutorial at http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/ait/. An answer to a question that consists solely of a quote to a properly cited source is also not acceptable. Although this does not constitute plagiarism, professors are unable to assess whether any actual learning, specifically the synthesis/application of knowledge, has been achieved by the student. Although finding sources is part of learning, this type of work by itself does not merit a passing grade. Students are expected to cite the source of information (<i>e.g.,</i> Wikipedia, website, textbook, journal article, class slides) but ALSO to <strong>paraphrase </strong>the material (rewrite the information in your own words) when answering questions on tasks that require an internet and/or literature search. When writing scientific or engineering reports it is <u>standard professional practice</u> to cite the appropriate work of other research scientists when discussing ideas or information that are not our own. Plagiarism is a very serious charge and can ruin promising careers.</p><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as independent research, original technical writing and live oral presentations. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and access to additional resources will be provided. Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library:</p><p> <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai">https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</a>.</p><p>Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. Additionally, all information Gathered using generative technologies must also cite the correct primary research articles in which that information was originally published. Be aware that AI technologies are typically unreliable at providing correct primary sources.<strong> </strong></p><p>While generative AI technologies can provide general background information, you are responsible for demonstrating your application of knowledge by reporting, interpreting, and explaining your experimental findings in the context of the primary literature. TurnItIn® text-matching software, including the AI detection function, may be used for the final reports.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</a></p><p>Overall, you are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI.</p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources">Student Success Office</a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students">Writing and Communication Centre</a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students">AccessAbility Services</a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide">Library</a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p><p>• <strong><u>Grievance:</u></strong> Students, who believe that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable, may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Students should read Policy #70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4. When in doubt, students must contact the department’s/school’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p><p> </p><p>• <strong><u>Discipline:</u></strong> Students are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offenses, and to take responsibility for their actions. Students who are unsure whether an action constitutes an offense, or who need help in learning how to avoid offenses (<i>e.g.,</i> plagiarism, cheating) or about ‘rules’ for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructors, academic advisor, or the Associate Dean of Science for Undergraduate Studies. For information on categories of offenses and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy #71, Student Discipline. For information on typical penalties, students should check Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties.</p><p> </p><p>• <strong><u>Appeals:</u></strong> A decision or penalty imposed under Policy 33 (Ethical Behavior), Policy #70 (Student Petitions and Grievances) or Policy #71 (Student Discipline) may be appealed, if there is a ground. Students, who believe they have a ground for an appeal, should refer to Policy #72 (Student Appeals).</p><p> </p><p><strong>COURSE RULES AND CONSIDERATIONS:</strong></p><p><strong><u>Verification of Illness Forms:</u></strong><u>  </u>Science students should be aware that the only Verification of Illness forms (VIFs) accepted for accommodation for missed assessments will be those issued by the University of Waterloo´s Health Services, when this service is open (https://uwaterloo.ca/health-services/). VIFs issued by walk-in clinics will not be accepted, except when obtaining a VIF from Health Services is not possible. If a student is sick on a weekend, during off-hours, while out of town or receiving ongoing care from a family physician or specialist, it is acceptable to provide documentation from other health service providers.</p><p>Information should include (1) date of the physician assessment, (2) dates of illness, (3) level of incapacitation and (4) whether the diagnosis was made by the physician or based on description by the student. Keeping the playing field level for all of our students is a priority. Students are reminded that obtaining a VIF under false pretences is an academic offense. For tests and exams, a student found guilty of misrepresentation will receive a failing grade</p><p>in the course and be suspended. Any questions concerning this policy can be directed to an undergraduate advisor in the Science Undergraduate Office. Student travel plans not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time. Only illness and extenuating circumstances (such as a death in the family) will be considered.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Students with Disabilities:</u></strong><u> </u>AccessAbility Services, located in Needles Hall, Room 1132, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If students require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of their disability, they should register with AccessAbility Services at the start of each academic term.</p><p> </p><p><i>We acknowledge that we live and work on the traditional territory of the Attawandaron (Neutral), Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
