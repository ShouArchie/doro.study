<h2>
  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>This is how a typical week of PSCI380 classes will look like:</p><p><strong>1. LEC</strong>: This is the in-person class where we discuss the concepts that are the most important for each topic. We’ll warm up with a 5-10 minutes “Trade in the News” discussion of topics you introduce. For better or worse, trade has been a very active area of policy in recent years. We will make sure to explore and discuss trade-related current events every week. Each (LEC) class will begin with a discussion of ‘Trade News’ where you can propose to discuss anything trade-related that you may have seen/read about during the previous week. The goal is to tie our course content as closely as possible to real policy developments.</p><p>Presentation slides will be used and posted after each class on UW Learn, however discussions will be wider-ranging, and note-taking on the additional content will be useful. This will be followed by a discussion of the assigned mandatory readings led by our designated Discussion Leaders.</p><p><strong>2. DIS</strong>: This is your online synchronous class discussion, where papers are discussed, concepts are clarified and questions are answered by your helpful TA. (Note that these online sessions are recorded, in accordance with UW regulations.)</p><p><strong>NOTEs:</strong> </p><p><strong>Attendance</strong>: Students are expected to attend all synchronous meetings (in-person and online) and be actively involved in class throughout the term. </p><p><strong>Participation: </strong>Students are expected to fully engage with the readings and participate in all (synchronous and asynchronous) class discussions every week. Students should aim to cover all required readings <i>before </i>each class meeting. Each student will take an informed and reasoned position based on each of the mandatory reading materials, and a component of your grade will reflect this. (see Student Assessment section below)</p><p> </p><h2>Schedule:</h2><p> </p><p>All students are required to read the materials for every section. </p><p>The course webpage on LEARN will provide the actual detailed list of readings used each week this term, including links to many of the readings. The LEARN <strong>Readings</strong> page will be updated weekly. </p><p>Normally a campus (or off-campus proxy via the UW library) internet connection may be required for free access to electronic journals. </p><p>I will make clear in class which of the readings are mandatory and meant for the <u>(LEC)</u>, which are for the online discussions <u>(DIS)</u> or for <u>reference (R)</u> only, and which are to be the subject of the following week’s position papers.</p><p> </p><p>Topic 1: Introduction to the course + The Evolution and Current State of International Trade</p><p>Topic 2: The Economics of Trade and Their Political Implications</p><p>Topic 3: Key debates in the International Political Economy of Trade</p><p>Topic 4: Trade and Domestic Institutions</p><p>Topic 5: US Trade Policy</p><p>Topic 6: Canadian Trade Policy</p><p>READING WEEK </p><p>Topic 7: Trade Multilateralism under the GATT/WTO</p><p>Topic 8: Trade Regionalism: Preferential Trade Agreements and Global Value Chains</p><p>Topic 9: Security Concerns in International Trade. Economic Statecraft and Economic Coercion</p><p>Topic 10*: choose one of: Gender and Racial Inequality in Trade / Trade and the Environment / Digital Trade, Data and Automation / Trade and Development</p><p>Topic 11: Final Essay Presentations and Referee Reports (last 1 or 2 weeks)</p><p> </p>

<h2>Study Materials: </h2><p> </p><p>NOTES on the Readings: </p><p>1. The course is relatively <u>reading-heavy</u>. There are several different reading materials due every week. That said, please use your judgement when allocating your time. The following hints may help:</p><p>- if it’s a relatively short piece: carefully read all of it and be prepared to discuss the main points.</p><p>- if the chapter/article/report is 100 pages long: skim-read it all and read the parts that communicate the substance of the work and sections that are interesting to you more thoroughly.</p><p>- if it’s a dense, jargon heavy paper: try to get the main picture from the abstract, intro and conclusion and do not focus on obscure technical points (unless you are into that kind of thing).</p><p> </p><p>All materials will be available online. Many of the weekly readings are journal articles, available online via the University of Waterloo Library website or VPN.  </p><p>In addition, these books are available <u>online</u> via the UW library. </p><p><i>Note: if the direct link doesn't work, search the book in Omni while logged into the Library's website.</i></p><p> </p><p>1.

<h4>1. DIScussions Participation: 10%</h4><p>This grade will be based on your attendance and weekly contributions to the weekly synchronous online discussion sessions (DIS) led by a TA. </p><h4>2. Weekly response papers and LEC participation (15%+10%)</h4><p>An online discussion forum will be open each week for students to post their <strong>weekly response papers</strong> (see below). These are <strong>due by 9 pm on Monday</strong> of each week, and you will use your discussion material in our in-person LEC class.</p><p>Note: you need to write one discussion post <u>and</u> respond to at least one other discussion post each week.</p><p>Readings for class discussion and short written assignments will be assigned each week. <u>One critical analysis item based on these readings</u> written up in a response paper (1-page, single or double-spaced) should be posted in the assigned discussion forum. This material will also constitute the basis for the discussion part of each (LEC) class. Do not summarize the papers. Pick one or two issues you strongly agree/disagree with and discuss critically. These weekly position papers will be marked on a binary (completed=1 or not completed=0) scale, amounting to 10% of your grade. Additionally, two of the response papers will be picked randomly out of your submissions at the end of the term to be marked for content, for an additional 5% (2*2.5%).</p><h4>Midterm Exam: 20%</h4><p>This in-class exam will be based on the material covered up to that point in the course and will consist of a few short-essay questions. Tentative due date: Tuesday<i>, February<sup> </sup>25<sup>th</sup>.</i></p><h4>Discussion Leading: 10%</h4><p>Each student will act as a Discussion Leader in one week of regular classes, except for the first two weeks. During the first week: please <u>email me your top 5 topics (from Topic 2-Topic 10)</u> in decreasing order of preference. Discussion Leaders should read all LEC readings for the week, and will lead the class discussion of the respective articles/chapters – in our (LEC) class - by posing questions that stimulate discussion. Discussion leaders for each week need to coordinate their contributions to avoid repetition. </p><p>(Note: <i>Discussion Leaders do not need to make a response paper posting for the week they are leading the class discussion, but will instead respond and comment to at least 3 posts on the online discussion forum</i>).</p><p>A guide for formulating useful questions can be found<a href="https://uvic470ecology.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/4/4/12445281/470_howtoleaddiscussion.pdf"> here</a>. </p><h4>Presentation + Annotated bibliography + Referee Report: 7%+3%+ 5%</h4><p>The last two classes are dedicated to student presentations. Each student will discuss the core argument of their final essay in a short class presentation and will submit an annotated bibliography to the instructor. The use of slides or handouts is encouraged but not required. Every paper presentation will be assigned a peer referee, who will receive the material ahead of time (normally at least 48 hours in advance) and will provide comments on the paper following the presentation. The intention is for each of you to receive constructive feedback on your work from your peers (referee and the rest of the class) before writing up the final papers.</p><h4>Final Essay: 20%</h4><p>This is either a research paper (theoretical and/or empirical) or a policy paper on a specific topic relating your trade politics interests to the broad themes of the course. The topic proposal must be submitted to the instructor for approval as early in the term as possible, and no later than the end of the Reading Week! </p><p>The final essay will be due on <i>April 12<sup>th</sup></i> and will consist of approximately 15 double-spaced pages, regular font size (12) and margins (about 2 cm). A minimum of 5 peer-reviewed academic sources should be used. There is no required citation style, just pick the one you are most familiar with and apply it correctly and consistently. More information on the final essay will be provided in class.</p><p><i>For help with library research please consult the UW Library’s<u> very helpful </u>“Political Science Research Guide” </i><a href="http://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/politicalscience">http://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/politicalscience</a><i>.  Use it to locate books, articles, connect with political science librarian, </i><a href="fkeramati@uwaterloo.ca">Farzaneh Keramati</a><i> for research support, and more.</i></p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.
