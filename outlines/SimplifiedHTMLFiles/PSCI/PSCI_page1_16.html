<p>The description above is the generic Calendar description for the course. The version of the course in the winter of 2025 has the following description:</p><p><i>Why is the global political economy in such crisis? This course examines scholarly literature that is analyzing multiple upheavals in the contemporary global political economy as well as the interconnections between them. Upheavals examined in the course include: the domestic backlash to free trade and economic globalization in the core of the world economy, the rise of China and intensifying US-China economic rivalry, the pandemic shock, growing weaponization of economic interdependence, economic transformations for environmental sustainability, global financial instability, digital disruption and Big Tech, and the relationship between rising national authoritarianism and global economic governance. The course is focused on very current literature in the field of global/international political economy.</i></p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>Students are expected to read at least four of the readings each week. A large choice of readings is provided each week in order to allow students to focus on the issues that interest them most. The instructor will provide a detailed overview of the topic and the relevance of the specific readings the week before the readings are discussed (the last portion of each class will be devoted to setting up the following week’s readings in this way). The readings are listed each week in alphabetical order rather than any order of priority.</p><p>The readings that are open access are noted after the item. Students can access them simply by searching the title on the internet. Two readings have a weblink. All other readings can be found in the UW Library’s Course Reserves. Course Reserves can be accessed using the Library Resources widget on the Course Home page.</p><p><strong><u>Week 1 (January 7): Introductions, questions, and setting up week 2’s readings </u></strong></p><ul><li>No assigned readings</li></ul><p><strong><u>Week 2 (January 14): Domestic backlash to free trade and globalization in the “core” of the world economy?</u></strong></p><ul><li>Stefan Borg. 2024.

<p>All written work must be submitted via the dropbox on the course LEARN website. All marks are released in LEARN. All work completed for this course must avoid plagiarism or other violations of academic integrity.</p><p><strong>REFLECTIVE ESSAY</strong></p><p>Each student must submit a Reflective Essay (between 3000 and 3500 words, not including bibliography/references) to the LEARN drop box by 6pm on February 25. The essay must react to the course readings in Weeks 2-6 of the course, with a minimum of 20 of these readings cited (these 20 do not need to come from all these weeks - students are welcome to specialize on the weeks that interest them most). The essay should not provide a detailed summary of the contents of the readings. Instead, it should develop a central thesis that relates to the student’s reactions to the readings. The essay is not a research paper - there is no need to consult any sources beyond the assigned readings. The essay should be written in a traditional essay format with appropriate acknowledgement of sources (proper footnotes, bibliography etc.). It can build on ideas in the student's presentation/discussant roles. The best essays will be those that: 1) demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of issues analyzed in the course through deep engagement with the course readings, 2) present creative, original and thoughtful arguments, 3) develop a clear central thesis that is persuasive and well-supported in the body of the paper, 4) are well organized and contain concise and clear writing with a professional tone throughout, 5) contain no errors of spelling, grammar, and referencing. Students can use any of the major referencing styles, as long as they use one method consistently and properly.</p><p><strong>FINAL ESSAY</strong></p><p>Each student is required to submit to LEARN dropbox a Final Essay (between 3500 and 4000 words, not including bibiliography/references) by 6pm on April 8. The essay must have a central thesis that is presented in the introduction and then backed up in the body of the paper. The essay must also include proper referencing and acknowledgement of all sources. Students can use any of the major referencing styles, as long as they use one method consistently and properly. For their essay topic, each student must choose between one of the following three options:</p><ul><li>Under the first option, the student writes an extended book review. The book choice must be approved by the course instructor. The first section of the essay (which can be no more than one third of the total length of the essay) must describe the central argument of the book. The rest of the essay must evaluate the book’s arguments in the context of the course readings (a minimum of 15 must be cited).</li><li>Under the second option, the student writes a reflective essay that reacts to the course readings, with a minimum of 20 readings from Weeks 8-10 being cited (these 20 do not need to come from all these weeks - students are welcome to specialize on the weeks that interest them most). The essay should not provide a detailed summary of the contents of the readings. Instead, it should develop a central thesis that relates to the student’s reactions to the readings. This essay is not a research paper - there is no need to consult any sources beyond the assigned readings. The essay can build on ideas from the student's presentation/discussant roles and Reflective Essay.</li><li>Under the third option, the student writes a research paper on a more specific topic relevant to the themes of the course. The topic must be approved by the course instructor. Because this option is a research paper, the paper must draw on a minimum of 10 academic sources (articles in scholarly journals or books) beyond the required readings in the course. The paper must also engage with course readings that are relevant to the research topic.</li></ul><p>The best essays will be those that: 1) demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of issues analyzed in the course through deep engagement with the course readings, 2) present creative, original and thoughtful arguments, 3) develop a clear central thesis that is persuasive and well-supported in the body of the paper, 4) are well organized and contain concise and clear writing with a professional tone throughout, 5) contain no errors of spelling, grammar, and referencing.</p><p><strong>SEMINAR PARTICIPATION ROLES</strong></p><p><i>Two presenter roles and one discussant role between weeks 2-10</i>. Between weeks 2 and 10, each student must make a short (5-6 minute) presentation in two separate weeks (the first must be in weeks 2-6 and the second in weeks 8-10). Each presentation should outline the student's reactions to the readings assigned for that week. These presentations may take the form of commentary, questions, agreements, and/or disagreements, but <u>they should not provide a summary of the contents of the readings</u>. Students should also try not to make their comments too specific, but rather to link their ideas to the broader themes being addressed that week. The best presentations will be those that react to the readings in creative, original, thoughtful and sophisticated ways, reflecting deep engagement with the arguments in the assigned readings. They will also be professional, respectful of differing opinions, well organized and clearly presented. A schedule of presentations will be drafted in week 1. Each student must also serve as a discussant once during weeks 2-10. When a student is selected by the instructor for the discussant role, the student's task is to identify two core issues raised in the presentations that they would like to see discussed by the class as a whole. The best discussants will be those who identify important issues raised in the presentations that are relevant to themes in the assigned readings for the week.</p><p><i>Presenter and discussant role during weeks 11-12</i>. During one of weeks 11 and 12, each student must present draft ideas for their final essay. Presentations should explain the tentative overall thesis for the essay and the evidence that will be used to support it (including course readings). If the essay is a book review, students also need to provide a brief description of the content of the book being reviewed. Presenters may also invite comments/advice about one or more challenges being experienced in the development of the arguments for the essay. The best presentations will describe the tentative overall thesis for the essay at the start of the presentation, be well organized and interesting, and demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of, and engagement with, issues addressed in course readings that are relevant to the essay topic. During one of weeks 11 and 12, each student must also serve as a discussant on other students’ presentations. Discussants must provide comments that are useful, constructive, and respectful.</p><p><strong>COURSE POLICIES ON LATENESS</strong></p><p>Any essay submitted after the deadline for these assignments will be assigned a lateness penalty of 1% of the overall course mark per day. For example, an Reflective Essay that is submitted within 24 hours after the deadline cannot receive a mark higher than 34/35; an essay submitted between 24-48 hours after the deadline cannot receive a mark higher than 33/35, and so on. No essays will be accepted one week after the deadline.</p><p><strong>COURSE POLICY ON GRADE APPEALS</strong></p><p>If a student does not understand a grade that was received and wishes to appeal it, the student must write out a one-page rationale and submit this rationale, along with the assignment, to the instructor no later than 7 days after the mark was released in LEARN (and no sooner than 48 hours after the mark was released). <strong>Grades may be either raised, stay the same, or lowered on appeal.</strong></p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system. The faculty and staff in Arts encourage students to seek out mental health support if they are needed.</p><p><strong>On campus supports</strong></p><p>For counselling (individual or group) reach out to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Campus Wellness and Counselling Services.</a> Counselling Services strives to provide a secure, supportive environment for students of all orientations and backgrounds.

Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. </p><p>Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information">Quest</a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory">CAUT Guide to Acknowledging Traditional Territory</a>.</p>

<div>
<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
