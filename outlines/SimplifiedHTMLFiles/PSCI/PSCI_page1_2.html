<p>Our world is undergoing profound global political and economic transformations in the twenty-first century. Who has the power to shape these transformations in global affairs? In this course, we examine the role that various actors play in global politics, from states down to individuals. We study the roles played in global politics by great powers, international organizations (such as the United Nations), tech companies and the private sector, terrorists, activists &amp; influencers, billionaires and diplomats. For each, we’ll ask what kinds of political and economic power they have. The course introduces students to the study of global politics and is a starting point for upper year courses in World Politics and International Political Economy.</p>

<td>Presentation in Discussion Group. Each student will be required to make one oral presentations to their discussion group between weeks 3 and 11. A schedule will be developed in each discussion group during the first meeting of the group in Week 2. Further details on these assignments are posted in LEARN. This presentation must be done a week that is different from those covered by the student’s reading summaries. The presentation will count for 10% of the final grade. Failure to complete a presentation will result in a loss of 10% from the final grade.</td>

<tr>
<td>Quote-Comment-Question (QCQ). Each student will complete several QCQ analyses over the course of the semester on a pass-fail basis. Each passed QCQ is worth 1% of the final grade. These should normally be submitted in the week the reading is assigned. These cannot be submitted after Tuesday, March 25, 9am to the LEARN dropbox. They are worth 10% of the final mark. Full details of the assignment are available on the LEARN website.</td>

<td>Lecture Brief. Each student must submit one short lecture brief (approximately 500 words) to the Dropbox in LEARN, on Friday, February 7, 9am. The mark on each makes up 10% of the final course grade. Further details on this assignment are posted in LEARN. Students may submit a second lecture brief any time before Friday, March 28 (9am) covering a different week. If the mark is higher, it will replace your first lecture brief. This extra lecture brief cannot substitute for a missing required lecture brief. No lecture brief can be submitted after March 28, 9am. None of the lecture briefs can cover a week when the student has a discussion group presentation.</td>
<td>10%</td>

<tr>
<td>Discussion Group Participation. Each discussion group will meet nine times during the term. Discussion groups are explicitly designed to help prepare students for their written assignments. The discussion group grade will be determined at the end of the course primarily on the basis of each student’s attendance record. Perfect attendance from weeks 3-11 will earn students a discussion participation mark of at least 7/10. Each student will lose one mark per unexcused absence (e.g. a student who misses one discussion group will earn at least 6/10; a student who misses two discussion groups will earn at least 5/10, etc.). If a student is judged by the TA to have consistently made constructive and outstanding contributions to the discussions in the group, the discussion group participation grade of that student may be augmented by the TA by up to three marks (out of 10) at the end of the term.</td>
<td>10%</td>

<tr>
<td>Midterm. An in-class midterm on February 25 will test students’ knowledge of material covered in weeks 2-6 in the course. If you have an excused absence for the midterm, you will write the make-up scheduled for March 11, during the class period (class cancelled for other students).</td>

<h2>Assignments and Grade Breakdown</h2><p>The table above represents the assignments and grade breakdown of this course. Further details about each assignment can be found on the course LEARN site. All work should be submitted to the drop box before the due date. All marks are released in LEARN. All work completed for this course must avoid plagiarism or other violations of academic integrity. The use of artificial intelligence tools is strictly prohibited for all assignments (see statement below). </p><p>All written material should be formatted with 12-point font and page numbers. The preferred citation style is the <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/chicago_manual_17th_edition/cmos_formatting_and_style_guide/chicago_manual_of_style_17th_edition.html">Chicago author-date style</a> which uses author-date citations in the text and a bibliography at the end. In this style, footnotes or endnotes are used only for explanatory digressions or notes of clarification.</p><p>Each student is assigned to one discussion group that meets weekly throughout the term, starting in week 2. All students must make one presentation to their group during the course (see below). Attendance in discussion groups is mandatory, as these are designed to help students to complete their written assignments.</p><p><br/> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students’ submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin® in this course.<br/><br/>You must notify the instructor in the first week of class (or in the first week you join, if after the start date) if you wish to use alternative assignments.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4><strong>Course and University Policies</strong></h4><h2>Course Policies on Lateness and Extensions</h2><h3>Grace Days</h3><p>All students are permitted five “grace days” (calendar days, i.e. inclusive of weekends) during the term which they can use to push back deadlines of the discussion brief or position paper (but not the QCQs, midterm or presentation) without penalty and without requesting permission. Up to two of the five grace days may also be used to excuse a discussion group absence. Unused grace days do not result in any benefit to a student’s overall course mark. <strong>Students using grace days do not need to seek permission from their TA; these will be noted automatically. Grace days cannot be used to extend the deadline of any assignment past April 15, 9am.</strong></p><p><strong>No assignments will be accepted under any circumstances after April 15, 9am. You will need to arrange an INC or petition the university after the course is complete. </strong></p><p> </p><h3>Extensions</h3><p>Students must exhaust their grace days before requesting a further extension or accommodation for an illness or crisis. Extensions can <strong>only</strong> be granted by the Head TA. If possible, these should be requested before the assignment due date. </p><p> </p><p>Please note: </p><ul><li>Extensions are not automatic</li><li>Students must use either <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">the Self-Declaration of Absence, and/or the Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances form</a>  to provide their documentation to the instructor. For longer absences or absences beyond the allowed number of Self-Declarations, upload your documents to the <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/JR7GyDXnAb">VIF / Extenuating Circumstances form</a></li><li>In exceptional circumstances, (one day absence for non-medical reason, e.g. co-op interview, sports tournament, funeral, etc. discussed <strong>in advance</strong>) Head TA may excuse an absence from discussion or authorize a short extension without the extenuating circumstances form, when grace days are exhausted.</li><li>If a student has no remaining grace days, and no extension is sought or granted, any written assignment in this course that is submitted after the deadline will be assigned at lateness penalty of 1% of the overall course mark (not the assignment mark) per day. For example, if the Position Paper is submitted within 24 hours after the deadline, it cannot receive a mark higher than 29/30; if it submitted between 24-48 hours after the deadline, it cannot receive a mark higher than 28/30, and so on.</li><li>No written assignments will be accepted more than seven calendar days beyond the deadline without a documented extenuating circumstance. Grace days cannot be used to extend this deadline. <strong>No assignments will be accepted, under any circumstances, after April 15, 9am. If circumstances prevent you from submitting assignments by this date, you will need to arrange for an INC (requires documentation; must contact instructor before April 15) or petition the university after the course is complete. </strong></li></ul><h3>Missed Presentation</h3><p>If a discussion group presentation is not done at the time and date it is scheduled, and you have an excused absence (Self-Declared Absence or VIF), students must contact their TA within 48 hours of the presentation time if they wish to re-schedule their presentation (an exception will be made in cases of severe illness or crisis). TAs will reschedule presentations for week 9 or another date of their choosing in consultation with the student.</p><p>Without an excused absence, students must still notify their TA within 48 hours of the presentation time if they wish to reschedule. The TA may re-schedule the presentation during Week 9 or at another date of their choosing, but it will be marked out of 5 (that is, there will be a 5% penalty on the final mark on the course [not the assignment mark]).</p><h3>Missed Midterm </h3><p>Missing the midterm requires an excused absence under all circumstances. Students must use either <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">the Self-Declaration of Absence, and/or the Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances form</a>  to provide their documentation to the instructor. Students with an excused absence may write the make-up midterm during the class period in Week 9. If this is not possible, another accommodation will be sought; usually the other assignments will be re-weighted.</p><p> </p><h3>Accommodation Policy </h3><p>If a student is registered with AccessAbility, the student should consult with the Head TA regarding necessary accommodations to allow participation in classes and discussion group, and completion of assignments &amp; exams. </p><p> </p><h2>Course Policy on Grade Appeals</h2><p>Any errors of addition should be raised immediately with the TA who marked your work. If a student is concerned that an assignment was not graded fairly, the student should first meet with the TA who marked the work. To request a review of an assignment from the TA and, later, the Head TA if required, the student must provide a 1-page explanation of why the assignment was improperly graded (i.e. what do you think you did that should have been given more weight?). The explanation, the original assignment, and a clean copy of the assignment should be submitted to the Head TA no later than <strong>7 days </strong>after the assignment was made available for return; they will forward to the marking TA. If the student is unsatisfied after consulting and discussing the matter with the TA and Head TA, the assignment will be passed on to the Professor for final grading. </p><p> </p><p>NOTE: Students must take responsibility for picking up their marked work from LEARN in a timely manner. No appeals will be considered that have been initiated more than 7 days after the assignment/exam was made available for return. <strong>Grades may be either raised, stay the same, or lowered on appeal.</strong></p><p> </p><h2>Illness and COVID-19</h2><p>Please do not come to class if you are ill. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, please follow the directions on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/health-and-safety/student-and-employee-covid-19-recommendations">University of Waterloo’s COVID-19 page</a>. </p><p>If you miss class, please be in touch with your TAs and instructors for necessary accommodations, as above.</p><p>It is your responsibility to catch up with the material you have missed, and we recommend that you make connections with peers in your discussion section and/or lecture section so that you can share notes, etc, early in the semester. The instructors and TAs will be happy to answer any questions you may have about course materials, but are not able to provide lecture notes beyond what is provided on the LEARN website. </p><h3>Exceptional Circumstances and Remote Learning</h3><p>In exceptional circumstances, the instructor may be absent from the course. In this case, one of two things will happen: </p><ul><li>Lecture will be cancelled, and the instructor will provide you with instructions for any extra reading, videos, or work that you may be expected to complete in lieu of attending a lecture;</li><li>Lecture may be moved online; this decision will be made no later than 8pm on Monday night before class, and a link will be provided to you at that time.</li></ul><p>Policy on Generative AI</p><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, including reading, analysis, and writing.  Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

This helps to demonstrate your learning in case there is suspicion of your use of an LLM or GenAI. This includes your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document.</p><p>The easiest way to do this is to save your work periodically with a new file name (I like to append the date at the end of my filename, eg.

If drafts are not provided, the instructor will either (a) submit a policy 71 case to the Associate Dean, or (b) deduct 5% of the final grade in the course from this assignment’s value.

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><p> </p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.
