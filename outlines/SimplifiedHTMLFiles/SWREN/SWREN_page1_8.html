<p><strong>Course Description</strong></p><p>Centring social work practice settings, this course engages critical and anti-oppressive thinking about the impacts of organizational ideologies and related policies and practices on social work practice. Social relations between social workers and service users, agency colleagues, and external services are explored through a critical examination of organizational funding mandates and regulations, ideologies, vision statements and policies, and forms and documents. Key concepts that currently structure many health and social service organizational equity strategies are considered including diversity, inclusion, and anti-racism along with related concepts such as decolonization and institutional injustice.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3><strong>Course Policies</strong></h3><h4><strong>Late Policy and Grace Days</strong></h4><p>You should make every effort to submit your assignments on time; however, I understand that juggling the many demands of work, school, and home life can be challenging and stressful at times. To help you manage your workload and care for your well-being, you have a total of <strong>3 grace days</strong> that you can apply to the assignments, however you choose. Grace days are essentially "extra" days beyond the listed due date where no late penalty is given and no questions are asked. You can use all 3 grace days on one assignment, or you can distribute them across all of your assignments. <strong>Please be sure to email me at least 2 days before the assignment due date to inform me that you will be using a grace day(s) to extend the assignment due date.</strong></p><p>If the assignment is submitted after the grace days have been used, one percent (1%) off the total worth of the assignment will be deducted each day the assignment is late, including weekends. If you need a further extension for completing an assignment, please contact me before your assignment due date (3 days before the due date, if possible). I care about your well-being and am here to support you.</p><h3><strong>Department Policies</strong></h3><p>For full departmental policies, refer to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/school-of-social-work/bsw-student-handbook"><u>Bachelor of Social Work Student Handbook 2024-2025</u></a>. More documents are available on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/school-of-social-work/"><u>School of Social Work</u></a> website.</p><h3><strong>Professional Conduct Policy</strong></h3><h4><strong>Preamble</strong></h4><p>The School of Social Work adheres to the Canadian Association for Social Work Education’s (CASWE) Accreditation Standards. In abiding by the standards of the national governing body, CASWE, the School of Social Work provides students and the surrounding communities a measure of confidence regarding competent, well-prepared professional social workers at the undergraduate and graduate level.</p><p>The School of Social Work and the agencies providing field education share in the responsibility to assist students to develop the skills to conduct themselves in a professional manner both in the classroom and in the field.</p><h4><strong>Policy Statement</strong></h4><p>The School of Social Work sets expectations of students’ conduct consistent with the expectations of professional conduct for practicing social workers. Based upon CASW Code of Ethics as well as workplace ethics, the student is expected to demonstrate commitment to their social work education as well as honesty, responsibility, reliability, and courtesy. Communication is the foundation of professional conduct.</p><h4><strong>Procedural Guidelines</strong></h4><p>The student is expected to focus their attention on the class and/or instruction being provided. Use of a personal computer or phone for reasons unrelated to course content, is not acceptable during on campus classes.</p><p>Attendance is expected in all social work courses and in the practicum setting. The student must make every effort to inform the instructor as early as possible prior to any absence (on campus or online) in a professional manner. In last minute circumstances (e.g. accident) the student must notify the instructor at the earliest possible time.</p><p>To support the student learning journey in the School of Social Work, students with any unexplained or unjustified absence will be informed of such, in writing, by the instructor and the Director of the School of Social Work will be copied. For professional clarity and consistent communication practices, any further absences will be documented in writing using the same process. The Director of the School of Social Work will follow up at their discretion.</p><h3><strong>Renison University College Policies</strong></h3><h4><strong>Policy on Plagiarism</strong></h4><p>Policy 71’s glossary defines plagiarism, in part, as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others (whether attributed or anonymous) as one’s own in any work submitted whether or not for grading purposes".</p><p>The Vice-President Academic and Dean has the authority to assess instances of plagiarism and the resultant penalties that are raised by an instructor. An instructor can propose a grade penalty to the Vice-President Academic and Dean, who will decide whether to accept the penalty or initiate a formal inquiry.”</p><p>For additional information on how plagiarism is dealt with at Renison, review the policy from where the above text is copied: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71 - Student Discipline</u></a>.</p><p>Students should also be aware that copyright laws in Canada prohibit reproducing more than 10% of any work without permission from its author, publisher, or other copyright holder. See Waterloo’s policy on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/fair-dealing-advisory"><u>Fair Dealing</u></a>. Violation of Canada’s Copyright Act is a punishable academic offence under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71 – Student Discipline</u></a>.</p><h4><strong>Communication Policy</strong></h4><p>Email, using the uWaterloo provided email address, is the approved method of communication for Renison. The Office 365 email that you use to login using your WatIAM login and password is secure and confidential. Take caution when forwarding your WatIAM email to an external email service as confidential information forwarded to a third-party provider could be a data security breach and violation of FIPPA (Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act) under which all students, staff, and faculty are bound by law.</p><h4><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of the instructor, which can include:</p><ul><li>lecture handouts and presentations (e.g., PowerPoint slides)</li><li>lecture content, both spoken and written (and any audio or video recording thereof)</li><li>questions from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams)</li><li>work protected by copyright (i.e., any work authored by the instructor)</li></ul><p>Making available the intellectual property of instructors without their express written consent (e.g., uploading lecture notes or assignments to an online repository) is considered theft of intellectual property and subject to disciplinary sanctions as described in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71 – Student Discipline</u></a>. Students who become aware of the availability of what may be their instructor’s intellectual property in online repositories are encouraged to alert the instructor.</p><h4><strong>Mental Health Support</strong></h4><p>All of us need a support system.
