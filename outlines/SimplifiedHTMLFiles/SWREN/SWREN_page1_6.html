<p>Centering social work practice settings, this course engages critical and anti-oppressive thinking about the impacts of organizational ideologies and related policies and practices on social work practice. Social relations between social workers and service users, agency colleagues, and external services are explored through a critical examination of organizational funding mandates and regulations, ideologies, vision statements and policies, and forms and documents. Key concepts that currently structure many health and social service organizational equity strategies are considered including diversity, inclusion, and anti-racism along with related concepts such as decolonization and institutional injustice.</p>

<div>
<h3>Course Policies</h3><h4>Late Policy and Grace Days</h4><p>You should make every effort to submit your assignments on time; however, I understand that juggling the many demands of work, school, and home life can be challenging and stressful at times. To help you manage your workload and care for your well-being, you have a total of <strong>3 grace days</strong> that you can apply to the assignments, however you choose. Grace days are essentially "extra" days beyond the listed due date where no late penalty is given and no questions are asked. You can use all 3 grace days on one assignment, or you can distribute them across all of your assignments. <strong>Please be sure to email me at least 2 days before the assignment due date to inform me that you will be using a grace day(s) to extend the assignment due date.</strong></p><p>If the assignment is submitted after the grace days have been used, one percent (1%) off the total worth of the assignment will be deducted each day the assignment is late, including weekends. If you need a further extension for completing an assignment, please contact me before your assignment due date (3 days before the due date, if possible). I care about your well-being and am here to support you.</p><h3>Department Policies</h3><p>For full departmental policies, refer to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/school-of-social-work/bsw-student-handbook"><u>Bachelor of Social Work Student Handbook 2024-2025</u></a>.

In abiding by the standards of the national governing body, CASWE, the School of Social Work provides students and the surrounding communities a measure of confidence regarding competent, well-prepared professional social workers at the undergraduate and graduate level.</p><p>The School of Social Work and the agencies providing field education share in the responsibility to assist students to develop the skills to conduct themselves in a professional manner both in the classroom and in the field.</p><h4>Policy Statement</h4><p>The School of Social Work sets expectations of students’ conduct consistent with the expectations of professional conduct for practicing social workers. Based upon CASW Code of Ethics as well as workplace ethics, the student is expected to demonstrate commitment to their social work education as well as honesty, responsibility, reliability, and courtesy. Communication is the foundation of professional conduct.</p><h4>Procedural Guidelines</h4><p>The student is expected to focus their attention on the class and/or instruction being provided. Use of a personal computer or phone for reasons unrelated to course content, is not acceptable during on campus classes.</p><p>Attendance is expected in all social work courses and in the practicum setting. The student must make every effort to inform the instructor as early as possible prior to any absence (on campus or online) in a professional manner. In last minute circumstances (e.g. accident) the student must notify the instructor at the earliest possible time.</p><p>To support the student learning journey in the School of Social Work, students with any unexplained or unjustified absence will be informed of such, in writing, by the instructor and the Director of the School of Social Work will be copied. For professional clarity and consistent communication practices, any further absences will be documented in writing using the same process. The Director of the School of Social Work will follow up at their discretion.</p><h3>Renison University College Policies</h3><h4>Policy on Plagiarism</h4><p>Policy 71’s glossary defines plagiarism, in part, as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others (whether attributed or anonymous) as one’s own in any work submitted whether or not for grading purposes".</p><p>The Vice-President Academic and Dean has the authority to assess instances of plagiarism and the resultant penalties that are raised by an instructor. An instructor can propose a grade penalty to the Vice-President Academic and Dean, who will decide whether to accept the penalty or initiate a formal inquiry.”</p><p>For additional information on how plagiarism is dealt with at Renison, review the policy from where the above text is copied: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71 - Student Discipline</u></a>.</p><p>Students should also be aware that copyright laws in Canada prohibit reproducing more than 10% of any work without permission from its author, publisher, or other copyright holder.

Melissa is an employment and human rights lawyer and part-time Assistant Crown Attorney for the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General. Melissa is experienced in case management, discipline and complaints processes, and works with organizations across Canada to foster safe, respectful, and inclusive work and learning environments through policy development, educational workshops, conflict mediation and dispute resolution, and organizational culture audits.</p><p>For additional information see Renison’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/renison/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/2022_ruc_hdap_policy_final.pdf"><u>Harassment, Discrimination, and Abuse Prevention Policy</u></a>.</p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>With gratitude, we acknowledge that Renison University College is located on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg, Hodinohsyó:ni, and Attawandaran (Neutral) Peoples, which is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes ten kilometres on each side of the Grand River from mouth to source. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place in all corners of our campus through research, learning, teaching, community building and outreach. We are guided by the work of our Reconciliation and Re-storying Steering Committee and Anti-Racism and Decolonization Spokescouncil, as well as the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous"><u>University of Waterloo’s Office of Indigenous Relations</u></a>.</p><p>Guided by Renison's commitment to reconciliation, the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/indigenous-people/aboriginal-peoples-documents/calls_to_action_english2.pdf"><u>Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action</u></a>, <a href="https://www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/"><u>Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls' Calls for Justice</u></a>, and <a href="https://caswe-acfts.ca/about-us/our-commitment-to-change/"><u>Canadian Association for Social Work Education's (CASWE) Commitment to Change</u></a>, the modules in this course work collectively to reveal the ways in which social work practices and social service organizations, as well as service user-social worker relationships are shaped by normative ideologies (e.g., colonial, white supremacist, cisheteropatriachal, classist, and ableist ideologies, etc.) as they are expressed in documents that are relevant to the purposes of social work. Through the exploration of a broad range of topics, using a critical lens, the course asks that we interrogate the profession and its related organizations to reveal the ways in which institutional injustices are linked to organizational texts and related practices.  </p><p><strong>Given our virtual space please take time to reflect on and acknowledge the land or traditional territory on which you reside and your relationship to it.</strong></p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
