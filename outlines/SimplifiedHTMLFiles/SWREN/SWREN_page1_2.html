<div>
<div>
<div>SWREN 423R:</div>
<p>The aim of this course is to develop student's knowledge of different approaches to social group work practice, and the ways in which specialized knowledge of client's life conditions, life circumstances, and significant life events informs social work practice with groups within a generalist framework. Emphasis is placed upon conceptualizing and analyzing group-work skills and the capacity for self-directed practice with groups directed towards increasing the resiliency of the group as a whole and the resiliency of individual group members. A salient goal is the use of democratic means so that group process in all social work groups reflects a vision of social justice.</p>

<p>This course builds on students' foundation level practice knowledge, with emphasis on the conceptual base and practice skills of social group work. Social work with groups is viewed as integrative practice, within a generalist framework and encompasses the continuum of social work with groups. This course is based on the belief that there are several important forces directing practice:</p><ul><li>the diverse needs of the oppressed and vulnerable populations we serve,</li><li>agency and social policy, as it identifies the parameters of service,</li><li>the worker’s theoretical orientation to group work practice, and</li><li>the worker’s evaluation of their practice with an eye toward increasing practice effectiveness.</li></ul><h3>Course Methodology</h3><p>This advanced social work group practice course will consist of modules delivered through an on-line format, together with group discussions and other experiential learning exercises. To enhance experiential learning, students will be involved in student group presentations and other course components. Students are expected to complete weekly required social work group practice readings. Participation in the course discussion activities is required in order to maintain a helpful and positive active learning environment for the entire class.</p>

Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>
