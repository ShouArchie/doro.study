  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Missed Assessments</h3><p>If you require an accommodation or extension, send your request as soon as possible to <a href="mailto:pd20@uwaterloo.ca"><u>pd20@uwaterloo.ca</u></a>. If you do not yet have documentation, we can still get the process started and help you determine what you will need.</p><p>Please send all requests from your @uwaterloo.ca email account and include in your email your student number, full name (as listed in WatIAM), and information and supporting documentation explaining why you are requesting an accommodation. The PD20 team will respond to your request within two working days.</p><p>The University of Waterloo is committed to ensuring you can access, and meaningfully participate in, your education. Students with permanent, temporary, or suspected disabilities/conditions are encouraged to contact <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students/applying-academic-accommodations"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> to register for accommodation and support services. The term ‘disability’ covers a broad range and degree of conditions that can be permanent, temporary, episodic, and suspected, including temporary disabilities, chronic conditions, disabling illness, as well as the physical, emotional, and psychological effects of a trauma (e.g., sexual violence). Accommodation plans can be developed for all courses and non-course degree requirements/milestones.</p><h3><strong>Late Days</strong></h3><p>You have three late days you may use throughout the term on all assessments (with the exception of the Major Reflective Report and the bonus assessments). If you miss a deadline, your work will still be accepted up to the number of late days that you have remaining. You have three late days total (not three late days per assessment).</p><p>If you use up all three late days and miss another assessment deadline, the assessment will not be accepted. To view how many late days you have remaining, check the "late days remaining" group in which you are enrolled. This item is visible by clicking <strong>Connect </strong>and then <strong>Groups </strong>on the navigation bar in LEARN, and will be updated prior to the next assessment due date. If you have any questions about Late Days, please email us at <a href="mailto:pd20@uwaterloo.ca"><u>pd20@uwaterloo.ca</u></a>.</p><p>Please note in Waterloo LEARN, students can see who else is a member of their group. This means that peers with the same number of late days available as you will know how many late days you have remaining. If you are uncomfortable with other students knowing your late day status, send an email to the <a href="mailto:pd20@uwaterloo.ca"><u>pd20@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> account and alternate arrangements for tracking your late days will be discussed.</p><p>Late days do not apply to the Major Reflective Report. Instead, students can submit the assignment up to one week past the due date, after which we will not accept submissions. There is a 10% deduction for late reports.</p><h3><strong>Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in PD 20</strong></h3><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) that is trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not prohibited in this course, <strong>however, proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement</strong>, as with any other source you may consult and reference (e.g., journal articles, textbooks), is required.</p><p>Unauthorized use of GenAI in this course, such as submitting content generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) without proper attribution, or representing content generated by AI as your own idea or work will be considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a>.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>If you choose to use GenAI in your course work, it should NOT replace your own ideas, work, or voice.</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Prohibited</strong>:</p><ul><li>Representing content generated by GenAI as your own, without proper attribution.</li><li>Sharing copyright-protected materials with open access GenAI (e.g., inputting any course materials into a GenAI tool).</li></ul><p><strong>Not-Prohibited</strong>:</p><ul><li>Using GenAI to brainstorm, generate prompts or examples that encourage reflection; to refine an original idea; or support your editing process.</li></ul><p><i><strong>If you choose to use GenAI, ensure you</strong></i>:</p><ul><li>Maintain primary authorship and your own voice throughout your work.</li><li>Critically assess and evaluate whether output from GenAI is factual, verifiable, and relevant.</li><li>Attribute properly throughout your work for all submissions.</li><li>Maintain documentation of how you’ve used GenAI in case it is requested.</li></ul><h4>Resources for Using Generative Artificial Intelligence</h4><p>Users remain responsible for ensuring that their use of AI tools complies with copyright and intellectual property laws.</p><h4>Documenting and Citing GenAI content</h4><p>To learn more about documenting and citing Generative Artificial Intelligence, visit the Writing and Communication Centre's <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/Resources-AI-Citing"><u>AI and the Writing Process – Documenting and Citing</u></a> page or the Library's <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>Research Guide on Generative Artificial Intelligence</u></a>.</p><h4>Using GenAI</h4><p>The Writing and Communication Centre has a great resource on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/Resources-AI-Overview"><u>Using ChatGPT and other Text-Generating Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)</u></a> and how to be productive and ethical in your use of GenAI as well as cautions and risks to consider.</p><h3><strong>Professionalism in Communication</strong></h3><p>The intention of the PD program, in part, is to promote the capacity to think, act and write professionally. This course will provide many opportunities to practice your professional communication skills, from preparing the assessment materials that you submit for grading to email communication with the PD graders, staff, or instructors. Students are expected to maintain a suitable level of professionalism in all course-related communications and to avoid unprofessional or offensive material.</p><p>An assessment which includes unprofessional content will receive a grade of zero. If you are not sure whether or not your content is professional, ask yourself the following questions:</p><ol><li>Would you present this in a job interview?</li><li>Would you present this to your supervisor post-graduation?</li><li>Would you talk about this in a networking or conference setting with colleagues?</li><li>Would you present this to your instructors as part of an academic assignment?</li></ol><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
