<h4>Budget and Financial Planning Assignments (37%) </h4><p><br/>Individually or in groups, students will complete mini-cases requiring them to prepare a budget and all related documentation, including tax implications, related to planning, saving, spending, and reporting. Assignments could provide a scenario; others could require the student(s) to prepare their own scenario. Three assignments will be used to represent the first three life stages in the course (student, new grad, and mid-life). Weights of the assessments will increase over the term, as will expectations for completion. All assignments will be completed and submitted outside of class time, by 11:59pm on the stated due date.</p><h4>Final Exam (25%) </h4><p><br/>Students will write a comprehensive final exam that builds on the previous budget and financial planning assignments and will require them to prepare or analyze a budget/financial plan, related schedules, and consider tax calculations and implications. The exam will represent the final life stage in the course (retired life) yet also require knowledge accumulated throughout the semester. Accordingly, you should expect to be tested on all material, including text, course readings, assignments, and class discussions delivered throughout the course. The final exam must be the exclusive work of the individual student. The final exam will be written on <strong>TBD </strong>(will be posted on LEARN once released), following the Winter 2025 schedule provided by the Registrar’s Office. </p><p>Faculty of Arts policy provides that students who wish to review their final examination papers informally may do so without instituting a formal appeal procedure. Such review will take place under supervised access only and will be arranged in a way that is mutually convenient for the instructor and the student.</p><h4>Group Data Assignment (15%)</h4><p>Students will work in a group to complete an evaluation and comparison of various selected or randomly determined investments. The assignment will require a written report detailing the comparison and conclusions reached, as well as collection and analysis of data and a visualization of certain findings. The assignment will be completed and submitted outside of class time, by 11:59pm on the stated due date.</p><h4>Group Formation and Feedback</h4><p><i>Formation</i>: For the Data and third Budget and Financial Planning assignments, students work in groups of 4 (or 3, depending on total enrolment), and <strong>groups can be formed across sections</strong>. Students can self-enroll <strong>starting Wednesday Jan 8</strong> and must <strong>enrol by</strong> <strong>11:59 pm on Friday, Jan 24</strong>; unenrolled students will be allocated to a group at random after the deadline. To enroll yourself, i) select View Available Groups in LEARN-Connect-Groups; ii) select Join Group in the Actions column of Group Assignments Team. To view a group member list (before enrolling), click the link in the Members column; after joining, click the Email Group icon to contact existing group members.</p><p><i>Feedback</i>: By default, we assume each group member contributes fairly and thus all members of a team <i>normally</i> receive the team’s grade for each assignment. <i><strong>If you agree, you need not submit any feedback</strong></i>. However, peer evaluations will be available for students to highlight a difference from this norm (i.e., to note a particularly strong or weak team member contribution). <i><strong>If you submit feedback</strong></i>, we ask that you evaluate each member, including yourself. Your form will remain strictly confidential and cannot be seen by other group members. However, we will blind carbon copy all group members on an email, if at least one member submits, and ask all members for feedback so that we have a more complete assessment of the group. A dropbox for each group assignment will be on LEARN, with a feedback form and submission instructions. Finally, should any serious, significant teamwork issues arise <i>that cannot be resolved among the team</i>, communicate with your instructor as soon as your resolution attempts fail, not after the assignment has been evaluated.</p><h4>Course Questions (13%)</h4><h4>TopHat Knowledge and Reflection Questions (5%)</h4><p>Knowledge and/or reflection questions will appear throughout the course notes (in TopHat). Knowledge questions will be assessed for accuracy and reflection questions will be assessed for completeness. The due dates for these questions are outlined in the detailed class schedule and on TopHat. <strong>Late submissions will not be accepted or graded</strong>.</p><p><strong>To be awarded a grade for these components, <u>you must enroll in TopHat using your UW username-specific email</u></strong> (no alias UW email address, or non-UW email address). Students <strong>failing to do so</strong> will be given one follow-up opportunity to correct the error, after which <strong>a grade of zero will be assigned</strong> for subsequent assessments.</p><h4>Module Practice Problems (8%)</h4><p>Each of the four life cycle modules contains an assigned practice problem, posted to LEARN. Electronic submissions (Word, Excel, OneNote, etc.)<strong> </strong>are accepted; you may also handwrite your solution and scan to pdf for submission. Submissions must be <strong>uploaded to LEARN</strong> (in the respective dropbox) by the stated due date in the detailed class schedule/LEARN calendar. <strong>Late submissions will not be accepted or graded</strong>.</p><p>Module problems will be attempted independently and marked for completion. <strong>GenAI use is not permitted for these problems</strong>. You will receive 2 (full) marks with a legitimate attempt at each problem, even without the correct answer. <strong>You must show your work for the markers to be able to assess your assignment. </strong>If you<strong> </strong>make a weak attempt at completion, you will receive 1 mark; an un-submitted or “no effort” attempt will result in a mark of 0. In general, assessments of your assignments are not eligible for regrading, unless a section of your assignment was clearly missed, or the stated mark was recorded incorrectly.</p><h4>Class Participation (10%)</h4><p>In-class participation is expected from students since class interaction is key to a positive learning experience. Most of our class time is spent applying knowledge towards financial planning, budgeting, and taxes, but it is directed by you, the student. The instructor is a facilitator of the knowledge and discussion.</p><p>Students will receive a final grade out of 10 based on detailed records compiled by teaching assistants and reviewed by the instructor. Grades will exclude a student’s lowest 2 classes, and will be otherwise be determined as follows:</p><ul><li>0 if you did not attend classes throughout the term;</li><li>1-3 if you attended classes throughout the term, but did not participate;</li><li>4-6 if you attended classes throughout the term, and participated sporadically and/or inconsistently throughout the term;</li><li>7-8 if you attended classes throughout the term, and participated meaningfully each week consistently throughout the term;</li><li>9-10 if you attended classes throughout the term, and participated meaningfully in the discussion several times each week consistently throughout the term.</li></ul><p><strong>Students must attend the section in which they are registered to be awarded participation marks. </strong>Note also that unprofessional behaviour will reduce participation marks (e.g., arriving late and/or leaving early without explanation, talking loudly in side conversations or otherwise interrupting others that are speaking, etc.).</p><h4>Notes on Assigned Work</h4><p>All assessments, exams and assignments (including TopHat responses, module practice problem submissions) must be the exclusive work of the individual student or, where applicable, group. Unless otherwise directed, no individuals or groups should be working together to complete any of the assessments or submissions. All major assignments (budget/plan or data) allow use of generative AI, but students/groups must follow the specific assessment instructions that clarify acceptable use and documentation. Budget and financial planning assignments or exams will assess students on all course materials up to that point in the course. The data assignment will rely on general themes introduced in the course but may also reference separate resources. </p><h4>Requests to Regrade an Assessment</h4><p>If you believe that a <strong>significant error</strong> has been made in the grading of a budget or data assignment, you may request a regrade. Regrade requests will not be available for Course Questions (TopHat and Module). Upon request, assignments will be evaluated by a different teaching assistant and marks could go up or down as part of the regrade process. The regrade instructions are as follows:</p><ol><li>Regrade requests must be submitted<strong> AFTER 24 HOURS </strong>and<strong> within one week of the assignment grade release.</strong> The 24 period is to ensure you give yourself sufficient time to effectively debrief your feedback and craft a reasonable request. Be mindful of the date and time grades are released, which correspond to a related announcement posted to LEARN. <strong>We will not respond or allow a regrade if you do not follow this requirement. </strong>Relatedly, if you do not receive a response confirming your request, it has not been considered.</li><li>Our grading procedures for consistency and accuracy help to ensure that all students are treated the same, but exceptions can occur. Again, we expect that regrade requests will be submitted only for <strong>substantial</strong> errors in grading (e.g., your individual feedback says that you didn't do something, yet you can show that you did). </li><li><strong>A regrade request must be made in writing by email</strong> to your section instructor and the lead Course Assistant, Damir Baizhiyenov (damirbaizhiyenov1@gmail.com), where the student submits a written report highlighting where the regrade is requested and why it is merited for specific parts of their submission. Your assignment will not be regraded based on comments like “I think I deserve a higher mark on my [category] score”. The comment should indicate what element of your submission that you believe did not receive deserved credit. Although rare, we will always make corrections for clear inconsistencies in your grade (i.e., specific feedback says you achieved one ranking, but assessment was checked for a lower ranking).</li><li>Regrades will not be completed with the student present. Please do not ask your instructor to review your assignment with you for additional points, which is unfair to other students adhering to the written process.</li><li>To ensure an overall fair grading process, your assignment will be reviewed in total to determine if there are reasons to increase, or decrease, the grade. Thus, regrades are not “one-way bets”. Your final grade could go up, down, or remain the same after the regrade is completed.</li></ol><h4>ADDITIONAL COURSE POLICIES</h4><h4>Submission Times</h4><p>Please be aware that the University of Waterloo is located in the Eastern Time Zone (GMT or UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time) and, as such, the time for your activities and/or assignments are due is based on this zone. If for some reason you are outside of the Eastern Time Zone and require assistance converting your time, please try the <a href="about:blank">Ontario, Canada Time Converter</a>.</p><h4>Late Submission Policy</h4><p>All assignments are due at 11:59:59pm on the stated due date. An assignment submission at midnight (12:00:00am) or later is late. Penalties, up to 100%, occur for late submissions. The penalty is 10% for submissions within one hour (i.e., until 12:59:59am), 25% for submissions within 24 hours, and 100% after 24 hours. Where applicable, final grades for an assignment, after penalty, are rounded down to the nearest whole number. For example, an award of a mark of 89.5/100 before a 25% late penalty (25 points) means a revised mark after reflecting the late penalty of 64/100. </p><p><strong>Reminder</strong>: Late submissions for Course Questions (TopHat and Module) are not accepted and will not be graded.</p><p>Accommodations for missed assessments follow SAF policy, as referenced below. Familiarize yourself with the policy: <strong>Students are responsible for following the Arts process for documentation AND contacting their instructor</strong> to request accommodation for absences <strong>by the specified deadlines. </strong>Failure to follow the approved processes will result in a<strong> zero for that course component.</strong> By default in this course, the weight for accommodated assessments is rolled forward to the final (budget and financial planning) exam. </p><p>If an accommodation is approved regarding a missed final exam, you need to consult with the course instructor about writing a deferred final exam. Other than in exceptional circumstances, <strong>students are expected to prioritize writing the final exam and completing the course</strong> (including making necessary arrangements for time away from work and being on campus). At the end of the current term, you will receive an INC course grade. When you have written the final exam, a grade revision will be submitted based on the results of the final exam and your other course work. <strong>Failure to write the final exam at the next SAF identified opportunity will result in a course grade based on the elements of the course that you completed.</strong></p><h4>Academic Integrity Offenses, Penalties, and Implications</h4><p>All students registered in the courses of the Faculty of Arts are expected to know what constitutes an academic offence, to avoid committing academic offences and to take responsibility for their academic actions. If you need any clarification about this issue, please ask for it before taking any action. We view cheating as an offence against your fellow students in the course, against the professor, and against the university. As a large part of our responsibilities as professors is to ensure that all students are treated fairly and to uphold and build the reputation of the school, we take all forms of cheating very seriously and will impose maximum penalties allowed under the policies of the university.</p><p>Due to the highly structured nature of the study plans and the fact that many SAF courses are offered on a limited basis, students should be aware that a penalty imposed as a result of an academic offence could result in a significant delay of the student’s degree completion and convocation dates - particularly if the penalty involves a suspension. For a related discussion of academic integrity, see the section below on Intellectual Property.</p><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>School of Accounting and Finance Academic Integrity Expectations</h4><p>Students at Waterloo and in SAF are expected to act with integrity, even when faced with difficult situations. Integrity is the cornerstone of the accounting and finance professions. What you practice at the University of Waterloo and in SAF will inform and even define who you are as an A&amp;F professional. As a student at the University of Waterloo and in SAF you are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, avoid committing offences and take responsibility for your actions. While there are common university wide expectations, you will also be expected to know and comply with course specific expectations as well. Participating in the course introduction and reviewing the course syllabus are basic expectations and are helpful regarding course specific academic requirements.</p><p>Policy 71 governs student discipline on campus and SAF works with the Associate Deans of a student’s home faculty when reporting academic misconduct. All suspected academic misconduct, regardless of type or severity, is reported to the appropriate Associate Dean who will review the evidence and apply the appropriate discipline and penalties.</p><p>Specific considerations for SAF students:</p><ul><li>Students majoring in accounting and finance programs at UWaterloo should be aware that, due to the highly structured nature of the study plans and the fact that many AFM courses are offered on a limited basis, a penalty imposed because of an academic offence could result in a significant delay of the student’s degree completion and convocation dates - particularly if the penalty involves a suspension.</li><li>Students placed on disciplinary probation will not be granted access to activities where they are viewed as SAF representatives. For example, students represent SAF in the AFM Fellowship Program, the Student Investment or Venture Fund, at case competitions, as TAs or Research Assistants, and as recruitment ambassadors. This is not an exhaustive list. When applying to participate in these activities, students are expected to declare if they are/are not on disciplinary probation. Normally, this access is denied for a period that spans two complete academic terms subsequent to the term in which the offence occurs.</li></ul><p>The academic integrity expectations for each of the assessments in this course have been outlined above as have the potentially unique implications for SAF students who fail to meet integrity expectations. These expectations are provided for further clarity and accompany the expectations outlined below in the discipline section (University Policy) and do not replace or reduce the importance of these expectations. If ever you are unsure about what’s expected of you, you are responsible for seeking clarification from an appropriate source. “I did not know” is not an acceptable personal justification or formal defense to an allegation.</p><p>Typical penalties include, but are not limited to, 0 on the assessment, an additional grade reduction for assessments less than 5% of the overall course grade, and academic probation for the remainder of the student's academic career (which affects eligibility for certain clubs and course, including SIF, SVF, etc.)</p><h4>Submission Times </h4><p>Please be aware that the University of Waterloo is located in the Eastern Time Zone (GMT or UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time) and, as such, the time for your activities and/or assignments are due is based on this zone. If you are completing a course online and are outside of the Eastern Time Zone and require assistance converting your time, please try the <a href="https://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_CA-ON.aspx">Ontario, Canada Time Converter</a>. Students are expected to attend and adhere to the course timing set through the Schedule of Classes.</p><h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances</h4><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spaces/">multi-faith spaces</a> that students can use for faith-based practices. </p><h4>SAF Process for Missed Assessments</h4><p>Students are expected to complete all course assessments and write examinations as scheduled; however, there may be circumstances where accommodating a missed assessment is approved. <strong>See your course syllabus for specific accommodation policies that apply to your course.</strong> It is possible the syllabus will identify a process that renders redundant any need to formally declare an absence by means discussed below (e.g., for regular quizzes perhaps the syllabus will identify that only x of y attempts will be included in the final grade).<br/><br/>Review “<strong>Declaring Absences</strong>” below for instructions on how to declare absences and request accommodations for missed course component(s). To be considered for an academic accommodation, SAF students must follow the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Arts Accommodations for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances</a>. <br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation for a missed assessment is approved</u>, the student is responsible for contacting instructor to discuss accommodation arrangements. The instructor will determine the appropriate accommodation.<br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation is approved regarding a missed final exam</u>, the student needs to consult with the course instructor about writing a deferred final exam. In this case, the University of Waterloo Incomplete (INC) grade process will be followed, where all course requirements are not completed during the term. It is important to understand that, particularly with a cooperative education program, it is possible a deferred writing date will not be perfectly convenient to the student. If necessary, a CEE representative may be able to assist a student in their communications with an employer, however, it is still the student’s responsibility to initiate and manage any such process. Other than in exceptional circumstances, students are expected to prioritize writing the exam and completing the course (including making necessary arrangements for time away from work and being on campus). At the end of the current term, students will receive an INC course grade. Once the final exam has been written, a grade revision will be submitted based on the results of the final exam and other course work. Failure to write the final exam at the next SAF identified opportunity will result in a course grade based on the elements of the course that were completed. </p><p>If a student does not utilize one of the indicated approved methods that can justify missing an assessment (and receive some sort of accommodation) or if the request through the VIF or Extenuating Circumstances System is not approved, the student will receive 0 for that course element missed. <br/><br/>It is important to understand and properly utilize the appropriate process. Indicating that someone did not know of a process will not be an accepted justification.</p><h4>Declaring absences </h4><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest</u>. This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought.

Any failure to abide by these requirements is a violation of the university's academic integrity requirements and is subject to proceedings under Policy 71, Student Discipline and Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour.  </p><h4>Attendance at the Registered Section</h4><p>You are assigned to a specific section for instructor grading and office hours. If you require a change, please contact an SAF Advisor. It is not appropriate to attend a session you are not enrolled in, without talking to the instructor first. Failure to attend the registered section can result in negative grade consequences (e.g., participation) and students cannot assert that they were otherwise not aware there could be potential negative grade outcomes associated with not attending their registered section.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.
