<p> </p><h2>Classes and Tutorial Sessions</h2><p>The course is organized into 11 topics, with a 70-80 minute class and 80 minute tutorial scheduled for each topic. <i><strong>Students can choose whether to come to the in-person Monday class or watch the online version. Each will cover the exact same content. The online Monday class will be recorded and available on LEARN typically later that Monday. No tutorials will be recorded.</strong></i></p><p>The purpose of the classes is to review and discuss the concepts, theories and knowledge that are core to this course. The purpose of the tutorial sessions is to work through problems that provide application to these concepts, theories and knowledge via problem-based activities completed in teams. </p><p>Students should come to the class sessions having reviewed the preparation material. Attendance / reviewing the class is important to ensure adequate preparation to participate and contribute in the tutorial sessions. Teams will work through problems each week specific to that week’s tutorial. Answers for the tutorial problems will be posted to LEARN each week. The tutorial problems will not be graded. However, be forewarned: the tutorial problems are a very good representation of the types of topics and problems that will be asked on the midterm and final exams.</p><h2>Quizzes</h2><p>Weekly quizzes will begin the week January 20 and continue week thereafter. Generally, quizzes will be available on Thursday morning (before noon) and available until Saturday at noon. The quizzes will be completed via LEARN using the quiz functionality. The real purpose of the quizzes is mostly to give students (i) a better idea of whether they are understanding and keeping up with the course material; and (ii) an idea as the form and structure of questions that will be on the midterm and final exam.</p><h2>Stock Selection Presentation:</h2><p> </p><p>The first tutorial will be focused on groups selecting the following:</p><ul><li>12 stocks that experts (or your group) expect to increase</li><li>12 random stocks</li><li>Stock market indices</li><li>The first tutorial, (week of January 8), will consist of groups picking these stocks</li><li>Stocks and indices will be tracked through the term</li></ul><p>Groups will then track these stocks in addition to two stock market indices – the S&amp;P 500 and the S&amp;P / TSX 60.  Groups will present their findings and conclusions during the last tutorial. </p><p>All teams are required to complete and submit the company selected data sheet and presentations by 6 p.m. on Monday, March 31. </p><p>The format for the team presentation will be as follows;</p><ul><li>Maximum 5 minutes in length</li><li>All team members must participate</li><li>Analyze and comment on the movements in the stock prices picked by the experts vs. random stocks vs. stock market indices</li><li>Assuming that groups would be charged 1.5% for “experts” to pick your stocks going forward, recommend whether to invest in the future with the stocks picked by the experts vs. random stocks vs. stock market indices</li><li>Maximum number of slides to be presented is 15; number of slides in the appendix available to support questions is unlimited</li><li>Question period/defense of findings and conclusions </li></ul><h2>Mid-term and Final Examinations:</h2><p> </p><p>All examinations must be the exclusive work of the individual student.</p><p>Students should expect to be tested on all material including: preparation material, tutorial content and classes. The midterm will be on Friday, February 28 from 6:30 – 8:00 pm (EST) and will include all material up to that date. The final examination will be 90 minutes duration and will be scheduled by the Registrar’s Office during the winter term examination period. The final examination is comprehensive, covering all material delivered throughout the course. Both of the midterm and final will be conducted in person with access to computers (for Excel purposes online). </p><p><i><strong>You are required to pass (50%) the weighted average of the midterm and final exam, to pass the course.</strong></i></p>

Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

In the event of a university required change, or even short-term instructor unavailability due to Covid, using an appropriate technology platform we will normally adopt an alternative meeting schedule that, as much as possible, mirrors/matches the existing in-person meeting schedule for the course/section. Both lectures and exams can be accessed remotely via technology platforms such as Teams, WebEx, Zoom, or MyLab. </p><p>Note that for students Covid-specific accommodations need to be registered through the process mentioned above. Consult the Accommodations for Missed Assessments as well as SAF Process for Requesting Accommodation for Missed Assessments sections. Any on-campus in-person assessments that require modification due to a university mandated change connected to in-person gathering will, if necessary, proceed in a manner that best achieves the intentions of the original assessment format. Any necessary changes will be communicated as soon as we reasonably can during the course of the term.</p><h4>School of Accounting and Finance Academic Integrity Expectations</h4><p>Students at Waterloo and in SAF are expected to act with integrity, even when faced with difficult situations. Integrity is the cornerstone of the accounting and finance professions. What you practice at the University of Waterloo and in SAF will inform and even define who you are as an A&amp;F professional. As a student at the University of Waterloo and in SAF you are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, avoid committing offences and take responsibility for your actions. While there are common university wide expectations, you will also be expected to know and comply with course specific expectations as well. Participating in the course introduction and reviewing the course syllabus are basic expectations and are helpful regarding course specific academic requirements.</p><p>Policy 71 governs student discipline on campus and SAF works with the Associate Deans of a student’s home faculty when reporting academic misconduct. All suspected academic misconduct, regardless of type or severity, is reported to the appropriate Associate Dean who will review the evidence and apply the appropriate discipline and penalties.</p><p>Specific considerations for SAF students:</p><ul><li>Students majoring in accounting and finance programs at UWaterloo should be aware that, due to the highly structured nature of the study plans and the fact that many AFM courses are offered on a limited basis, a penalty imposed because of an academic offence could result in a significant delay of the student’s degree completion and convocation dates - particularly if the penalty involves a suspension.</li><li>Students placed on disciplinary probation will not be granted access to activities where they are viewed as SAF representatives. For example, students represent SAF in the AFM Fellowship Program, the Student Investment or Venture Fund, at case competitions, as TAs or Research Assistants, and as recruitment ambassadors. This is not an exhaustive list. When applying to participate in these activities, students are expected to declare if they are/are not on disciplinary probation. Normally, this access is denied for a period that spans two complete academic terms subsequent to the term in which the offence occurs.</li></ul><p>The academic integrity expectations for each of the assessments in this course have been outlined above as have the potentially unique implications for SAF students who fail to meet integrity expectations. These expectations are provided for further clarity and accompany the expectations outlined below in the discipline section (University Policy) and do not replace or reduce the importance of these expectations. If ever you are unsure about what’s expected of you, you are responsible for seeking clarification from an appropriate source. “I did not know” is not an acceptable personal justification or formal defense to an allegation.</p><h4>Submission Times </h4><p>Please be aware that the University of Waterloo is located in the Eastern Time Zone (GMT or UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time) and, as such, the time for your activities and/or assignments are due is based on this zone. If you are completing a course online and are outside of the Eastern Time Zone and require assistance converting your time, please try the <a href="https://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_CA-ON.aspx">Ontario, Canada Time Converter</a>. Students are expected to attend and adhere to the course timing set through the Schedule of Classes.</p><h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances</h4><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spaces/">multi-faith spaces</a> that students can use for faith-based practices. </p><h4>SAF Process for Missed Assessments</h4><p>Students are expected to complete all course assessments and write examinations as scheduled; however, there may be circumstances where accommodating a missed assessment is approved. <strong>See your course syllabus for specific accommodation policies that apply to your course.</strong> It is possible the syllabus will identify a process that renders redundant any need to formally declare an absence by means discussed below (e.g., for regular quizzes perhaps the syllabus will identify that only x of y attempts will be included in the final grade).<br/><br/>Review “<strong>Declaring Absences</strong>” below for instructions on how to declare absences and request accommodations for missed course component(s). To be considered for an academic accommodation, SAF students must follow the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Arts Accommodations for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances</a>. <br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation for a missed assessment is approved</u>, the student is responsible for contacting instructor to discuss accommodation arrangements. The instructor will determine the appropriate accommodation.<br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation is approved regarding a missed final exam</u>, the student needs to consult with the course instructor about writing a deferred final exam. In this case, the University of Waterloo Incomplete (INC) grade process will be followed, where all course requirements are not completed during the term. It is important to understand that, particularly with a cooperative education program, it is possible a deferred writing date will not be perfectly convenient to the student. If necessary, a CEE representative may be able to assist a student in their communications with an employer, however, it is still the student’s responsibility to initiate and manage any such process. Other than in exceptional circumstances, students are expected to prioritize writing the exam and completing the course (including making necessary arrangements for time away from work and being on campus). At the end of the current term, students will receive an INC course grade. Once the final exam has been written, a grade revision will be submitted based on the results of the final exam and other course work. Failure to write the final exam at the next SAF identified opportunity will result in a course grade based on the elements of the course that were completed. </p><p>If a student does not utilize one of the indicated approved methods that can justify missing an assessment (and receive some sort of accommodation) or if the request through the VIF or Extenuating Circumstances System is not approved, the student will receive 0 for that course element missed. <br/><br/>It is important to understand and properly utilize the appropriate process. Indicating that someone did not know of a process will not be an accepted justification.</p><h4>Declaring absences </h4><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest</u>. This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness</strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodation, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Abse nce Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodation, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture </h4><p>In addition to any other language addressing recording of lectures in this outline, when permission is granted the use of all course recordings is strictly limited to the purpose of private/personal study and for no other reason (e.g., loaning the recording or reproducing a copy for another student, contesting grading, posting in whole or part online, etc.). Any failure to abide by these requirements is a violation of the university's academic integrity requirements and is subject to proceedings under Policy 71, Student Discipline and Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour.  </p><h4>Attendance at the Registered Section</h4><p>You are assigned to a specific section for instructor grading and office hours. If you require a change, please contact an SAF Advisor. It is not appropriate to attend a session you are not enrolled in, without talking to the instructor first. Failure to attend the registered section can result in negative grade consequences (e.g., participation) and students cannot assert that they were otherwise not aware there could be potential negative grade outcomes associated with not attending their registered section.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. </p><p>Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information">Quest</a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p>
