  Course Description
</h2>
<div>

<div>
<p>The course is designed to provide you with the following insight into auditing: what audits of financial statements entail; why we have audits; why users of financial statements care about the auditor’s report; oversight of the auditing profession; the auditor’s role in the business environment; and how an auditor assesses client risks and assertions to plan and perform an audit.</p><p>The course will cover core auditing concepts, including institutional arrangements among companies, regulators, and auditors. The goal is to go over how to plan, conduct, and conclude an audit. The course will also give you a thorough understanding of auditing and its role in society, including why specific procedures or approaches are followed in conducting an audit, and help you learn how to take a position and defend that position (as these are critical skills needed to be an auditor).</p>

<h2><strong>Class Participation (10%)</strong></h2><p>This course will use an active learning approach; therefore, a high level of participation from students is strongly encouraged.</p><p>There are 24 classes in the semester. Two classes (the first and the last) do not have tracked participation, leaving us 22 classes. Each class has a maximum of <strong>five</strong> participation marks available, or a total of <strong>110 marks</strong>. Your <strong>two</strong> lowest grades will be dropped, resulting in your score being graded out of 100 marks (highest 20 scores * 5 marks per class). This category is worth 10% of your total grade for the course.</p><p>Participation marks will be allocated based on attendance and active engagement during class discussions. Students will receive half the available marks for attending and observing the class proceedings. To earn full participation marks, students must actively contribute to discussions by providing meaningful insights or questions at least three times during the class. It is important to note that responses such as simple affirmations or questions related to assignments or exam logistics will not be counted towards participation. This approach ensures that contributions are substantive and enhance the collective learning experience.</p><p>To accurately assess participation, students must complete a short quiz at the end of each class from class 02 through class 23. This quiz will include three questions that capture whether the student attended the class, the level of their participation, and a brief description of their contributions. To facilitate an organized and fair assessment of participation, assigned seating will be implemented based on students’ seating arrangements during the second class. </p><p>Finally, I reserve the right to “cold” call on students in class to foster active participation. When called upon, students are encouraged to give their best effort in contributing to the discussion. Our classroom is an inclusive environment where every voice is valued, and students can pass on participation if they feel unprepared or uncomfortable. This approach is meant to encourage learning and develop an ongoing dialogue, not to judge or pressure. Your contributions are appreciated, and I will strive to create a supportive atmosphere where all students feel empowered to engage at their own pace. However, this would only be used if there is no active participation. If this is a concern, please talk to me in person.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Weekly Quizzes (10%)</strong></h2><p>There are 12 weekly quizzes scheduled for the semester. Each weekly quiz will add up to 10 marks and include up to five written response questions based on the contents covered in class during the respective week. The quiz tool in LEARN will be used to present these written response questions weekly for consistent and efficient submission and grading. There is no time limit, but only one attempt to complete this part of the weekly quiz. This part of the weekly quizzes will be graded based on effort (0 marks = not done/no effort; 5 marks = minimal effort; 10 marks = good effort). Most students are expected to achieve full marks for this part of the weekly quizzes.</p><p><strong>Weekly quizzes 1 through 8 and 12 are due by Wednesday at 11:00 AM (EST), whereas Weekly Quizzes 9, 10, and 11 are due by Friday at 11:59 PM (EST).</strong></p><p>The lowest two quiz scores will be dropped, resulting in your total score being graded out of 200 marks (highest 10 scores * 20 marks per quiz). No accommodations will be offered for missed, incomplete, or late submissions due to technical challenges, alternate priorities, etc.</p><p>The weekly quizzes aim to reinforce your understanding of course material and/or engage you in the material we will reinforce in our in-class sessions. Even if you do not attend a particular in-class session, completing the quizzes for that session before the scheduled class will help you understand the material and get more out of your viewing.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Homework Assignment 01 (10%)</strong></h2><p>Homework assignment 01 is designed to deepen your understanding of the professional biases commonly encountered by assurance service providers. Through this two-part assignment (part A is a group assignment, and part B is an individual assignment), you will engage creatively and critically with these concepts, fostering a comprehensive grasp of how biases can impact the audit process.</p><ul><li><strong>Part A. GROUP Creative Video Presentation (70 Marks):</strong> In the first part of this assignment, you are required to <strong>create a ten-minute video</strong> that is creative, engaging, and insightful. <strong>This is a group assignment.</strong> Your video should focus on one of the 12 commonly faced biases assigned to each group by the instructor. The goal is to explain the nature, indicators, and effective defences against the assigned bias in a manner that informs and entertains your peers. Consider using storytelling, animation, interviews, or other creative techniques to convey your message effectively. <strong>Your video must be submitted in the respective dropbox in LEARN by 11:00 AM on Wed. - Jan 29</strong>. Late submissions will not be accepted.<br/><br/>Once submitted, videos developed by groups across all sections will be made available to students by 11:59 PM on the same day, allowing ample time to review and reflect.<br/> </li><li><strong>Part B. INDIVIDUAL Peer Review and Analysis (30 Marks): </strong>For the second part of the assignment, you are expected to critically review any three videos created by your peers (excluding the one created by your group). <strong>This is an individual assignment.</strong> For each video, individual students will provide a 250-word analysis or constructive critique that assesses the content and the effectiveness of the message delivered. The critique should be thoughtful and respectful, offering insights on how the video succeeded in conveying its message and suggestions for potential improvements. <strong>Each analysis is worth 10 marks, for a total of 30 marks.</strong> This part of the assignment encourages you to engage with diverse perspectives, enhancing your understanding of the various biases and how others perceive them. This part of the assignment <strong>(three critiques) must be submitted in the respective dropbox in LEARN by 11:59 PM on Fri. - Jan 31</strong>.<br/><br/><i>An example of a video (part A) and a constructive critique (part B) will be shared on LEARN for reference.</i></li></ul><p> </p><h2><strong>Homework Assignment 02 (10%)</strong></h2><p>This <strong>individual </strong>assignment aims to reinforce your knowledge of the course concepts by translating what you learned into your own words, hopefully leading you to better apply your understanding of course concepts in a real-life setting. Specifically, it requires you to review a provided detailed business process in a case study and perform necessary research and analyses to document relevant course concepts (such as process documentation, risks, assertions, internal controls, audit procedures, etc.) in the form of a memo. </p><p>Students are expected to earn 75% on average for this assignment. This <strong>individual </strong>assignment is worth <strong>100 marks </strong>and is due by <strong>11:59 pm (EST) on Friday, Feb. 28</strong>.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Midterm Exam (25%)</strong></h2><p>This course will include a midterm exam worth 25% of your final grade. The midterm exam (90 minutes) is scheduled IN PERSON at 4:30 PM (EST) on Friday, Mar. 7 (week eight). Students should expect to be tested on all material, including text, course readings package, assignments, and lectures, until the end of week seven. A detailed overview of the content, structure, expectations, etc., will be provided to help you better prepare for the midterm exam.</p><p>I will not return the midterm exam. You are welcome to arrange to view the exam during office hours. Written requests for re-grading a mid-term examination must usually be made within one week after the examination has been graded and the scores are released in LEARN. A written request must clearly articulate your reasons for believing why your responses were improperly graded. I reserve the right to re-grade the entire examination. Accordingly, exam marks may increase, decrease, or remain the same upon re-grade.</p><p>If you cannot attend the midterm exam, you must submit supporting documentation justifying the absence. If accepted, which is not guaranteed, a make-up exam will be made during weeks 9, 10, or 11. Note that the make-up exam, while containing similar content, will not be the same as your fellow students will have taken. Thus, it will vary in effort and content.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Group Class Discussions (10%)</strong></h2><p>This group assignment category will revolve around a comprehensive case study available on LEARN (Contents &gt;&gt;&gt; Evaluations &gt;&gt;&gt; Group Class Discussions) showcasing the background as well as processes for the Revenue cycle, Purchases cycle, and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Reporting cycle of a hypothetical case study.</p><p>We will form <strong>6 groups in Section 01</strong> and <strong>12 groups in Section 02</strong> (with 4-5 students per group). Send me an email (<a href="mailto:amitm.mehta@uwaterlo.ca">amitm.mehta@uwaterlo.ca</a>) with your preferences for group composition by <strong>noon on Sunday, Jan. 12</strong>. At that time, we will set up groups based on preferences provided to date and group all other students haphazardly.</p><p>During each of the Monday and Wednesday classes of weeks 9, 10, and 11, groups will lead class discussions on pre-assigned core concepts of the assurance framework in the context of the provided case study. These concepts are: </p><p><i>Identifying relevant <strong>risks</strong>,</i></p><ul><li><i>Identify what <strong>data </strong>you will need and any potential issues with the same, </i></li><li><i>Discussing the relevant aspects of applicable <strong>criteria</strong>,</i></li><li><i>Discussing the more relevant <strong>assertions</strong>,</i></li><li><i>Identifying existing and required new internal <strong>controls</strong>,</i></li><li><i>Developing detailed <strong>tests of controls</strong> audit procedures, and</i></li><li><i>Developing detailed <strong>substantive testing</strong> audit procedures.</i></li></ul><p>Each of these concepts is to be discussed in the context of:</p><ul><li><i>Their relevance to the audit profession (general, theoretical base),</i></li><li><i>The Revenue cycle (case study specific),</i></li><li><i>The Purchases cycle (case study specific), and</i></li><li><i>The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Reporting Process (case study specific).</i></li></ul><p>Here’s a schedule of the topics and groups assigned for <strong>each of these three weeks</strong>:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td> </td><td><p><strong>Monday Class</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Wednesday Class</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3"><p><br/><strong>Week 09</strong></p></td><td>Class 17 – Mar. 10</td><td>Class 18 – Mar. 12</td></tr><tr><td><i><u>Concept</u></i>: Risks</td><td><i><u>Concept</u></i>: Criteria</td></tr><tr><td><i><u>Section 01</u></i>: Groups 01 and 02<br/><i><u>Section 02</u></i>: Groups 01 and 02 </td><td><i><u>Section 01</u></i>: No classes<br/><i><u>Section 02</u></i>: Groups 03 and 04 </td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3"><p><br/><strong>Week 10</strong></p></td><td>Class 19 – Mar. 17</td><td>Class 20 – Mar. 19</td></tr><tr><td><i><u>Concept</u></i>: Assertions</td><td><i><u>Concept</u></i>: Controls</td></tr><tr><td><i><u>Section 01</u></i>: No classes<br/><i><u>Section 02</u></i>: Groups 05 and 06 </td><td><i><u>Section 01</u></i>: Groups 03 and 04<br/><i><u>Section 02</u></i>: Groups 07 and 08 </td></tr><tr><td><p> </p></td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3"><p><br/><strong>Week 11</strong></p></td><td>Class 21 – Mar. 24</td><td>Class 22 – Mar. 26</td></tr><tr><td><i><u>Concept</u></i>: Test of Controls</td><td><i><u>Concept</u></i>: Substantive Testing</td></tr><tr><td><i><u>Section 01</u></i>: Groups 05 and 06<br/><i><u>Section 02</u></i>: Groups 09 and 10 </td><td><i><u>Section 01</u></i>: No classes<br/><i><u>Section 02</u></i>: Groups 11 and 12 </td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Firstly, both groups are expected to review the entire case, perform research, and prepare a written outline (a maximum of five pages) of a response to the assigned requirements (see LEARN for more details). This outline is due by 11:59 PM (EST), <strong>five calendar days before the groups are scheduled to present in class</strong> (for e.g. if the presentation is scheduled on Monday of Week 09, the outline is due by 11:59 PM (EST) on Wednesday of Week 08. Conversely, if the presentation is scheduled on Wednesday of Week 09, the outline is due by 11:59 PM (EST) on Friday of Week 08).</p><p>Next, the groups will lead discussions revolving around the critical aspects of their analysis, addressing the assigned requirements (20 minutes) and constructively challenging the other group’s analysis through insightful questions (10 minutes) during the class. </p><p>All relevant details can be found on LEARN (Contents &gt;&gt;&gt; Evaluations &gt;&gt;&gt; Group Class Discussions), including the above schedule, case study, requirements for each pair of groups, and the grading rubric. <strong>This category is worth 10% of your total grade for the course.</strong></p><p><strong>Note</strong><i>: For all group projects in this course, each group member will receive the same mark for the project unless a member is deemed a free rider. Groups are responsible for informing the instructor if free riders exist. If the group’s assessment is valid, the free rider’s mark may be deducted up to 100 percent at the instructor’s sole discretion.</i></p><p> </p><h2><strong>Final Group Project (25%)</strong></h2><p>This course will also include a final group project worth 25% of your final grade (in lieu of a comprehensive final exam). All relevant details and resources for this assignment will be provided on LEARN (Contents &gt;&gt;&gt; Evaluations &gt;&gt;&gt; Final Group Project) by week 07 at the latest. </p><p>Each group will be assigned a unique, comprehensive case that simulates real-world audit scenarios. This project will require groups to approach the case as a professional audit team, addressing multiple components of an overall audit. The analysis will span the entire financial statement audit lifecycle, offering students the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding and application of auditing principles in a practical context. Students will complete the project in the same group with which they will complete the discussion case. Active participation and collaboration within your group are essential for receiving full credit for this assignment.</p><p>The project is divided into <u>two parts</u>:</p><ul><li><strong>Part A. Q&amp;A Defense Session (5% of Final Grade): </strong>Each group will participate in a 30-minute Q&amp;A session on Friday, Apr. 04 (Week 12), between 8:30 AM and 1:00 PM. During the assigned timeslot, groups will defend their analyses in a simulated audit meeting. This session will test students’ ability to articulate and justify their audit decisions and recommendations. All group members must be prepared to discuss their approach, key findings, and the rationale behind their conclusions.</li><li><strong>Part B. Comprehensive Written Report (20% of Final Grade): </strong>For the remaining 20% of the project grade, each group will submit a detailed written report. This report should comprehensively cover all aspects of the financial statement audit lifecycle pertaining to their assigned case. The written report is due by <strong>11:59 PM (EST) on Sunday – Apr. 13</strong>. You must actively participate in your group to receive full credit on the project.</li></ul><p> </p><h2><strong>Research Participation</strong></h2><p>Research supports a deeper understanding of accounting’s impact on the business environment. This understanding adds context to class instruction and contributes to the overall accounting knowledge. Research informs regulators, audit firms, investors, managers, etc. Thus, research is a critical part of a vibrant university. To this end, we may have an opportunity for you to experience research firsthand while facilitating this crucial process by engaging in research-related activities this semester.</p><p>If the opportunity becomes available, you can complete this activity in one of two ways (choose one option or the other —no double credit will be given for doing both). You can earn 0.5% for either option. <strong>You may complete multiple activities (if available), each for 0.5%, to a maximum of 1% as extra credit toward your final semester grade</strong>. In no case can this extra credit earn you an overall grade percentage greater than 100% of your semester grade.</p><ul><li><i><u>Option 1</u></i>: To complete the extra credit opportunity, you will participate in one approved experimental session that may be offered at a time outside of class. Note that this may or may not become available depending on research availability. Advance preparation will likely be necessary if specifically requested in advance. A research or teaching assistant will collect your attendance. Also, please be aware that if you are in another class with a research requirement (e.g., Psychology, etc.), you cannot double count the studies you do for that class toward your research credit in this class.</li><li><i><u>Option 2</u></i>: To complete this activity, you will write a 2-page report about a research article. There will be a selection of articles on Learn that you can choose from to complete. You are also welcome to select an article if you would rather (with pre-approval by your instructor). You can choose an article that investigates an audit topic from one of the following journals: The Accounting Review (TAR), Contemporary Accounting Review (CAR), Accounting Organizations and Society (AOS), Behavioral Research in Accounting (BRIA), Auditing: A Journal of Practice &amp; Theory (AJPT), or another journal your instructor pre-approves. Your article must be current, with publication coming on or after January 1, 2016.</li></ul><p>You should note the article selected and briefly summarize the hypotheses, methodology, sample of participants, results, and discussion of the article's main conclusions. Then, provide your impressions of the project and how it relates to your studies. Prepare a 2-page report (12-point, double-spaced, 1-inch margins) that includes this information. If you choose this option, you must hand it in on or before <strong>11:59 pm (EST) on Monday, Mar. 31. (week 12)</strong>.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>McGraw Hill Connect Extra Credit Quizzes  </strong></h2><p>Lastly, 12 weekly quizzes <i>(one for each week this term)</i>, including up to 10 textbook problems (multiple-choice or true/false questions), can be completed through the online McGraw Hill Connect platform <strong>for extra credit</strong>. </p><p>You must have your individual copy of the electronic textbook to complete the textbook portion of the weekly quiz. Once started, you will have 60 minutes and only one attempt per week to complete this part. These quizzes will be auto-graded based on the accuracy of your answers.</p><p>At the end of the term, receiving a grade between 51% and 100% for any 10 out of the 12 McGraw Hill Connect quizzes will earn you a maximum of 2% as extra credit toward your final semester grade. A grade between 5% and 50% for any 10 out of the 12 McGraw Hill Connect quizzes will earn you a maximum of 1% as extra credit toward your final semester grade. In no case can this extra credit earn you an overall grade percentage greater than 100% of your semester grade.</p><p><strong>McGraw Hill Connect weekly quizzes 1 through 8 and 12 are due by Wednesday at 11:00 AM (EST), whereas Weekly Quizzes 9, 10, and 11 are due by Friday at 11:59 PM (EST).</strong></p>

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p> </p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><p> </p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><p> </p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p> </p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

In the event of a university-required change or even short-term instructor unavailability due to unforeseen circumstances, using an appropriate technology platform, we will generally adopt an alternative meeting schedule that, as much as possible, mirrors/matches the existing in-person meeting schedule for the course/section. Both lectures and exams can be accessed remotely via technology platforms such as Teams, WebEx, Zoom, or MyLab. During the first week (only), if you walk up to me, introduce yourself, and hand me a piece of paper with a joke (the darker, the better), you may qualify (depending on the originality and humour of the joke) for one (no questions asked, penalty-free) late submission (up to seven days maximum) for any individual assignment (except the midterm exam) for this course.</p><p>Note that Covid-specific accommodations must be registered for students through the abovementioned process. Consult the sections of the Accommodations for Missed Assessments and the SAF Process for Requesting Accommodation for Missed Assessments. Any on-campus in-person assessments that require modification due to a university-mandated change connected to in-person gatherings will, if necessary, proceed in a manner that best achieves the intentions of the original assessment format. Any required changes will be communicated as soon as possible during the term.</p><p> </p><h4>School of Accounting and Finance Academic Integrity Expectations</h4><p>Students at Waterloo and in SAF are expected to act with integrity, even when faced with difficult situations. Integrity is the cornerstone of the accounting and finance professions. What you practice at the University of Waterloo and in SAF will inform and even define who you are as an A&amp;F professional. As a student at the University of Waterloo and in SAF you are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, avoid committing offences and take responsibility for your actions. While there are common university wide expectations, you will also be expected to know and comply with course specific expectations as well. Participating in the course introduction and reviewing the course syllabus are basic expectations and are helpful regarding course specific academic requirements.</p><p>Policy 71 governs student discipline on campus and SAF works with the Associate Deans of a student’s home faculty when reporting academic misconduct. All suspected academic misconduct, regardless of type or severity, is reported to the appropriate Associate Dean who will review the evidence and apply the appropriate discipline and penalties.</p><p>Specific considerations for SAF students:</p><ul><li>Students majoring in accounting and finance programs at UWaterloo should be aware that, due to the highly structured nature of the study plans and the fact that many AFM courses are offered on a limited basis, a penalty imposed because of an academic offence could result in a significant delay of the student’s degree completion and convocation dates - particularly if the penalty involves a suspension.</li><li>Students placed on disciplinary probation will not be granted access to activities where they are viewed as SAF representatives. For example, students represent SAF in the AFM Fellowship Program, the Student Investment or Venture Fund, at case competitions, as TAs or Research Assistants, and as recruitment ambassadors. This is not an exhaustive list. When applying to participate in these activities, students are expected to declare if they are/are not on disciplinary probation. Normally, this access is denied for a period that spans two complete academic terms subsequent to the term in which the offence occurs.</li></ul><p>The academic integrity expectations for each of the assessments in this course have been outlined above as have the potentially unique implications for SAF students who fail to meet integrity expectations. These expectations are provided for further clarity and accompany the expectations outlined below in the discipline section (University Policy) and do not replace or reduce the importance of these expectations. If ever you are unsure about what’s expected of you, you are responsible for seeking clarification from an appropriate source. “I did not know” is not an acceptable personal justification or formal defense to an allegation.</p><p> </p><h4>Submission Times </h4><p>Please be aware that the University of Waterloo is located in the Eastern Time Zone (GMT or UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time) and, as such, the time for your activities and/or assignments are due is based on this zone. If you are completing a course online and are outside of the Eastern Time Zone and require assistance converting your time, please try the <a href="https://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_CA-ON.aspx">Ontario, Canada Time Converter</a>. Students are expected to attend and adhere to the course timing set through the Schedule of Classes.</p><p> </p><h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances</h4><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spaces/">multi-faith spaces</a> that students can use for faith-based practices. </p><p> </p><h4>SAF Process for Missed Assessments</h4><p>Students are expected to complete all course assessments and write examinations as scheduled; however, there may be circumstances where accommodating a missed assessment is approved. <strong>See your course syllabus for specific accommodation policies that apply to your course.</strong> It is possible the syllabus will identify a process that renders redundant any need to formally declare an absence by means discussed below (e.g., for regular quizzes perhaps the syllabus will identify that only x of y attempts will be included in the final grade).<br/><br/>Review “<strong>Declaring Absences</strong>” below for instructions on how to declare absences and request accommodations for missed course component(s). To be considered for an academic accommodation, SAF students must follow the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Arts Accommodations for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances</a>. <br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation for a missed assessment is approved</u>, the student is responsible for contacting instructor to discuss accommodation arrangements. The instructor will determine the appropriate accommodation.<br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation is approved regarding a missed final exam</u>, the student needs to consult with the course instructor about writing a deferred final exam. In this case, the University of Waterloo Incomplete (INC) grade process will be followed, where all course requirements are not completed during the term. It is important to understand that, particularly with a cooperative education program, it is possible a deferred writing date will not be perfectly convenient to the student. If necessary, a CEE representative may be able to assist a student in their communications with an employer, however, it is still the student’s responsibility to initiate and manage any such process. Other than in exceptional circumstances, students are expected to prioritize writing the exam and completing the course (including making necessary arrangements for time away from work and being on campus). At the end of the current term, students will receive an INC course grade. Once the final exam has been written, a grade revision will be submitted based on the results of the final exam and other course work. Failure to write the final exam at the next SAF identified opportunity will result in a course grade based on the elements of the course that were completed. </p><p>If a student does not utilize one of the indicated approved methods that can justify missing an assessment (and receive some sort of accommodation) or if the request through the VIF or Extenuating Circumstances System is not approved, the student will receive 0 for that course element missed. <br/><br/>It is important to understand and properly utilize the appropriate process. Indicating that someone did not know of a process will not be an accepted justification.</p><p> </p><h4>Declaring absences </h4><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest</u>. This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness</strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodation, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Abse nce Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodation, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><p> </p><h4>Recording lecture </h4><p>In addition to any other language addressing recording of lectures in this outline, when permission is granted the use of all course recordings is strictly limited to the purpose of private/personal study and for no other reason (e.g., loaning the recording or reproducing a copy for another student, contesting grading, posting in whole or part online, etc.). Any failure to abide by these requirements is a violation of the university's academic integrity requirements and is subject to proceedings under Policy 71, Student Discipline and Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour.  </p><p> </p><h4>Attendance at the Registered Section</h4><p>You are assigned to a specific section for instructor grading and office hours. If you require a change, please contact an SAF Advisor. It is not appropriate to attend a session you are not enrolled in, without talking to the instructor first. Failure to attend the registered section can result in negative grade consequences (e.g., participation) and students cannot assert that they were otherwise not aware there could be potential negative grade outcomes associated with not attending their registered section.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. </p><p>Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information">Quest</a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p>
