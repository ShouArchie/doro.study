<h2>Individual Engagement Activities</h2><p>Individual engagement activities help to develop and socialize learners to the role of the university student in their learning.  You control your learning and can demonstrate this through the 3Ps – preparing for class, participating during class, and practicing (or evaluating your progress) after class.  Learning is not a spectator sport and requires active engagement in the process. Attending class and doing so prepared is an expectation for success in this course. For this course you will be working with your peers in class in small groups.  When working with others you are expected to be an active contributor to the discussion.  By sharing your experiences and perspectives and listening to the experiences and perspectives of others you are contributing to the learning in your community and ultimately the success of you and its members. </p><p>As an A&amp;F professional these engagement behaviours will contribute to your effectiveness as a colleague, team member and ultimately manager/leader.  The behaviours of engagement are valued by employers and can set you apart.  These behaviours can be demonstrated in several ways in the workplace such as through effective organization, planning and monitoring which will result in meeting deadlines, through collaboration with others to successfully complete projects, or through offering feedback to your staff to promote their growth and development.</p><p>To demonstrate your engagement in this course, you will complete individual engagement checks throughout the term.  These checks correspond to the prepare (pre-reading), participate (in-class), and practice (follow-up) learning activities within each week. These may include:</p><ul><li>completion of LEARN quizzes or surveys to demonstrate your preparedness for class</li><li>submission of the results of class/group discussions and activities to demonstrate your active participation during class</li><li>completion of practice activities to demonstrate your application and/or evaluation of what you’ve learned after class</li></ul><p>Individual engagement will be worth 20% of your final grade and will be assessed upon satisfactory completion of these activities throughout the term, as described below: </p><ul><li>Satisfactory completion of greater than 90% of the activities = 20%</li><li>Satisfactory completion of 80% - 89.9% of the activities = 17.5%</li><li>Satisfactory completion of 70% to 79.9% of the activities = 15%</li><li>Satisfactory completion of 60% to 69.9% of the activities = 12.5%</li><li>Satisfactory completion of 50% to 59.9% of the activities = 10%</li><li>Satisfactory completion of less than 50% of the activities = 0%</li></ul><p><i>Academic Integrity expectations for individual engagement:</i></p><p><i>The individual engagement checks are an assessment of an <u>individual </u>student’s engagement in this course, and therefore any work submitted to demonstrate engagement must be the exclusive and original work of the individual student.  In other words, while you are welcome to discuss these activities with your peers, the work you submit must be yours and yours only.</i></p><h2>peerScholar Cycles</h2><p>Feedback is also important to success.  Not only is feedback helpful to you as the recipient, but there is also a role you play in the giving of feedback to your peers to help them improve.  You will demonstrate your ability to give effective feedback to support the learning of your peers by completing three (3) feedback cycles throughout the term.  Each cycle is an opportunity to improve your ability to provide effective feedback to improve the learning outcomes for your peers.  You’ll also be the recipient of effective feedback from your peers to improve your own learning outcomes – a win, win!</p><p>The peerScholar Cycles will be worth 10% of your final grade (practice cycle 1%, email cycle 4%, and memo cycle 5%).  Each feedback cycle will be evaluated based on the quality of the feedback you provide.  All feedback is done anonymously using peerScholar software to facilitate submission and grading. </p><p><i>Academic Integrity expectations for peerScholar Cycles:</i></p><p><i>The providing of feedback in the peerScholar Cycles is an assessment of an <u>individual </u>student’s ability to provide effective feedback to support the success of their peers in this course and therefore any work submitted to demonstrate this must be the exclusive and original work of the individual student.  In other words, while you are welcome to discuss these activities with your peers, the work you submit must be yours and yours only.</i></p><h2>Assessments </h2><p>All assessments must be the exclusive work of the individual student.</p><h2>Individual Assessment #1 (IA#1) - Ethical decision making as a SAF student and future A&amp;F professional</h2><p>Throughout your academic and professional careers, you will be confronted with ethical dilemmas which you may not even appreciate at the time.  How you respond to these dilemmas will define who you are as a university student, a co-op student, and as an A&amp;F professional.  This course will expose you to the ethical standards expected of a SAF student and an A&amp;F professional and why integrity is considered a cornerstone of these professions.  You will be given the opportunity to experience how ethical dilemmas might be resolved to ensure you are equipped to make sound decisions yourself. You will discuss and practice the skills and attributes needed to respond to example situations you may face. Practicing your response now will help prepare you to respond in a way that is consistent with your values when faced with real life situations at school and in the workplace. </p><p>You will demonstrate your understanding of the importance of integrity as a SAF student and future A&amp;F professional and your ability to respond ethically and professionally to value conflicts you may face on IA #1, worth 10% of your final course grade.  IA#1 is a timed assessment taking place in person on Friday Jan. 31 at 4:30pm. </p><p><i>Academic Integrity expectations for IA#1:</i></p><p><i>IA#1 is an assessment of an individual student’s understanding and application of ethical considerations of a SAF student and future A&amp;F professional and therefore any work submitted must be the exclusive and original work of the individual student. This assessment will be a timed assessment that you must complete in person using your laptop in an assigned room. Discussion, collaboration with others, and the use of aids of any kind are not allowed. </i></p><h2>Individual Assessment #2 and #3 (IA#2 and IA#3) - Written Communication &amp; Problem Solving</h2><p>A&amp;F professionals are storytellers. While they have the expert knowledge and skills to understand and interpret the numbers, it is their ability to use this understanding to develop solutions or recommendations to open ended problems and communicate these solutions or recommendations to support decision making that is of value to others.  This course focuses on improving your communication and problem-solving skills so that you can apply these skills effectively in a professional environment to and with other professionals.  You will demonstrate your communication and problem-solving skills using two common forms of business communication: email and memo. </p><p>You will demonstrate your professional communication and problem-solving skills on IA#2 and IA#3, worth a combined total of 35% of your final course grade.  IA#2 (email genre) will be due by Friday Mar. 21.  Instructions for completing this assessment will be made available after class on Thursday of that week.  IA#3 (memo genre) is a timed assessment, taking place on Friday Apr. 04 from 6:00pm – 9:00pm.  This assessment will be completed online.  If this assessment time conflicts with a scheduled course activity or assessment in one or more of your other courses, please notify us by Jan. 17th.</p><p><i>Academic Integrity expectations for IA#2 and IA#3</i></p><p><i>IA#2 and IA#3 are assessments of an individual student’s written communication and problem-solving skills and therefore any work submitted to demonstrate these skills must be the exclusive and original work of the individual student. In other words, while you are welcome to discuss this assessment with your peers, the work you submit must be yours and yours only. IA#3 will be a timed assessment that will be completed online during a specified period of time.  Discussion and collaboration with others during that time are not allowed.  In addition, as part of any written communication, you will be expected to give credit when and where credit is due using appropriate citation formatting. For more information on citation and referencing see the “Citation Guide – APA” in LEARN under Course Resources/Academic Integrity.</i></p><p><strong>Group PSP Assessment (PSP) - Problem-solving</strong></p><p>In this course you will be introduced to a systematic approach to problem solving called the SAF Problem Solving Process.  Throughout university and in the workplace, you will be faced with many unknowns. While some of these unknowns will have clear solutions, most will not.  Your ability to develop solutions in new and unique situations is what will make you a successful A&amp;F professional.  Employers don’t hire you for what you know (technical ability is assumed), employers hire you for what you can do with that knowledge, and much of what you’ll be expected to do is problem solve.  Through two major cases discussed during the term, students will have the opportunity to practice the application of this approach to arrive at a recommendation. </p><p>Your understanding of the SAF Problem Solving Process and its application to open-ended problems will be assessed on the PSP Assessment worth 10% of your final grade and will be due on Mar. 07.   </p><p><i>Academic Integrity expectations for PSP</i></p><p><i>The problem-solving assessment is an assessment of the group’s understanding of the SAF Problem Solving Process and its application to open ended problems and therefore any work submitted to demonstrate this understanding and application must reflect the understanding of each of the group members.  All group members are expected to contribute equally.  You may be asked to submit confirmation of each group member’s contributions.  Discussion, collaboration, and coordination amongst group members are expected. However, discussion, collaboration, and coordination with other groups are not allowed.</i></p><h2>PebblePad workbook - Manage your learning</h2><p>In the past you may not have given much thought to how you learn, focusing instead on what you’re learning. But learning is so much more than memorizing facts and information.  Learning, in and of itself is a skill and it is a lifelong one, so learning how to manage the practice and development of the knowledge, skills, and behaviours you’ll need to succeed as a SAF student, co-op student, and eventually as a professional is important.  As you prepare for your first co-op job in a year from now, your ability to articulate your skills to others will also become important.  This is how employers determine what and how you’ll contribute to the success of their organization and whether or not they’d like to hire you (or rehire you).   You’ll demonstrate your ability to manage your learning and articulate your skills at 3 points during the term by completing the PebblePad workbook.  The PebblePad workbook is a term long activity where you will document what and how you’re practicing and developing the skills in this course.  Documenting progress is something you may participate in on the job as co-op students and most certainly as future A&amp;F professionals.   </p><p>PebblePad Workbook is worth 15% of your final grade:</p><p>•            PebblePad workbook check #1 (6%) – due by Jan. 31</p><p>•            PebblePad workbook check #2 (6%) – due by Mar. 14</p><p>•            PebblePad workbook check #3 (3%) – due by Mar. 28</p><p><i>Academic Integrity expectations for PebblePad workbook.</i></p><p><i>The PebblePad workbook is personal. It will challenge you to practice specific behaviours of the metacognition cycle so that you can become more intentional about the skills and attributes you want to develop and then use this improved self-awareness to articulate your skills to others. Authentic and genuine responses are expected and therefore any work submitted must be the exclusive and original work of the individual student. While you are welcome to discuss your workbook with your peers, the work you submit must be yours and yours only.</i></p><h2>ADDITIONAL COURSE POLICIES</h2><h2>Late Submission Policy</h2><p>A successful SAF student plans and makes time for learning and chooses effective learning and organizational strategies to get things done. These behaviours are demonstrated through the completion and submission of course assessments by the due dates. </p><p>1.           Late submissions of individual engagement checks will not be accepted. </p><p>2.           Late submissions to the peerScholar cycle will not be accepted and will prevent you from participating in the balance of the cycle. </p><p>3.           Individual Assessment #1 is an in-person timed assessment and must be completed at the scheduled time and be handed in at the end of that scheduled time. Late submissions will not be accepted.</p><p>4.           If you are unable to submit Individual Assessment #2, the PebblePad Workbook, or the Group Problem Solving Assessment by their respective deadlines, a late submission penalty of 20% per day your work is late will apply.  Individual Assessment #2, PebblePad Workbook, and the Group Problem Solving Assessment will not be accepted after 48 hours after the original deadline. </p><p>5.           Individual Assessment #3 is an online timed assessment and must be completed at the scheduled time and submitted by the end of that scheduled time.  Late submissions will not be accepted.</p><h2>Penalties for Academic Integrity Offenses</h2><p><i>See "School of Accounting and Finance Academic Integrity Expectations" (under Administrative Policies)</i> <i>for guidelines regarding the assessment of penalties for academic offenses. Should it be necessary to refer a matter to an Associate Dean it is possible that they may impose a different penalty (or direct that a different penalty be imposed even if being resolved informally) due to particular circumstances.</i></p><h2>Group Work Policy</h2><p>All students participating in group work tasks, whether graded or not are expected to participate fully and contribute as predetermined by the members group or the instructor of the course. Failure to participate fully will result in a grade revision if an investigation by the course instructor reveals that any student did not meet their predetermined participation level. Additionally, failure to fully participate and still obtain the full group mark can be interpreted as an attempt to obtain a mark that was not earned and therefore a breach of Policy 71. Additionally, all members of a group are equally responsible for any academic offenses that occur during a group assignment and any penalties will be applied to all members.</p><h2>Re-grade Requests</h2><p>A successful SAF student receives and interprets the feedback they receive on their assessments to determine where they’re at, what’s working and what’s not, what they know and don’t know etc.  If, after receiving and interpreting your assessment feedback, you feel your work was incorrectly evaluated, you can submit a re-grade request. Written requests for re-grading an assessment must normally be made within one week after the assessment results have been returned using the re-grade request process communicated through our LEARN site. No requests will be accepted within the first 24 hours after a grade is released to allow you time to review and consider your feedback. A written request must be submitted that indicates your reasons for believing the assessment was improperly graded and identifies specifically where the grading error has occurred. The instructor reserves the right to re-grade the entire assessment and not just the areas you’ve identified in your request.  Please follow the instructions carefully when submitting a re-grade request. Failure to do so could result in your request being denied.</p><p><i>“Faculty of Arts policy provides that students who wish to review their final examination papers informally may do so without instituting a formal appeal procedure. Such review will take place under supervised access only and will be arranged in a way that is mutually convenient for the instructor and the student.”</i></p><p> </p>

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

Integrity is the cornerstone of the accounting and finance professions. What you practice at the University of Waterloo and in SAF will inform and even define who you are as an A&amp;F professional. As a student at the University of Waterloo and in SAF you are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, avoid committing offences and take responsibility for your actions. While there are common university wide expectations, you will also be expected to know and comply with course specific expectations as well. Participating in the course introduction and reviewing the course syllabus are basic expectations and are helpful regarding course specific academic requirements.</p><p>Policy 71 governs student discipline on campus and SAF works with the Associate Deans of a student’s home faculty when reporting academic misconduct. All suspected academic misconduct, regardless of type or severity, is reported to the appropriate Associate Dean who will review the evidence and apply the appropriate discipline and penalties.</p><p>Specific considerations for SAF students:</p><ul><li>Students majoring in accounting and finance programs at UWaterloo should be aware that, due to the highly structured nature of the study plans and the fact that many AFM courses are offered on a limited basis, a penalty imposed because of an academic offence could result in a significant delay of the student’s degree completion and convocation dates - particularly if the penalty involves a suspension.</li><li>Students placed on disciplinary probation will not be granted access to activities where they are viewed as SAF representatives. For example, students represent SAF in the AFM Fellowship Program, the Student Investment or Venture Fund, at case competitions, as TAs or Research Assistants, and as recruitment ambassadors. This is not an exhaustive list. When applying to participate in these activities, students are expected to declare if they are/are not on disciplinary probation. Normally, this access is denied for a period that spans two complete academic terms subsequent to the term in which the offence occurs.</li></ul><p>The academic integrity expectations for each of the assessments in this course have been outlined above as have the potentially unique implications for SAF students who fail to meet integrity expectations. These expectations are provided for further clarity and accompany the expectations outlined below in the discipline section (University Policy) and do not replace or reduce the importance of these expectations. If ever you are unsure about what’s expected of you, you are responsible for seeking clarification from an appropriate source. “I did not know” is not an acceptable personal justification or formal defense to an allegation.</p><h4>Submission Times </h4><p>Please be aware that the University of Waterloo is located in the Eastern Time Zone (GMT or UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time) and, as such, the time for your activities and/or assignments are due is based on this zone. If you are completing a course online and are outside of the Eastern Time Zone and require assistance converting your time, please try the <a href="https://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_CA-ON.aspx">Ontario, Canada Time Converter</a>. Students are expected to attend and adhere to the course timing set through the Schedule of Classes.</p><h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances</h4><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spaces/">multi-faith spaces</a> that students can use for faith-based practices. </p><h4>SAF Process for Missed Assessments</h4><p>Students are expected to complete all course assessments and write examinations as scheduled; however, there may be circumstances where accommodating a missed assessment is approved. <strong>See your course syllabus for specific accommodation policies that apply to your course.</strong> It is possible the syllabus will identify a process that renders redundant any need to formally declare an absence by means discussed below (e.g., for regular quizzes perhaps the syllabus will identify that only x of y attempts will be included in the final grade).<br/><br/>Review “<strong>Declaring Absences</strong>” below for instructions on how to declare absences and request accommodations for missed course component(s). To be considered for an academic accommodation, SAF students must follow the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Arts Accommodations for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances</a>. <br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation for a missed assessment is approved</u>, the student is responsible for contacting instructor to discuss accommodation arrangements. The instructor will determine the appropriate accommodation.<br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation is approved regarding a missed final exam</u>, the student needs to consult with the course instructor about writing a deferred final exam. In this case, the University of Waterloo Incomplete (INC) grade process will be followed, where all course requirements are not completed during the term. It is important to understand that, particularly with a cooperative education program, it is possible a deferred writing date will not be perfectly convenient to the student. If necessary, a CEE representative may be able to assist a student in their communications with an employer, however, it is still the student’s responsibility to initiate and manage any such process. Other than in exceptional circumstances, students are expected to prioritize writing the exam and completing the course (including making necessary arrangements for time away from work and being on campus). At the end of the current term, students will receive an INC course grade. Once the final exam has been written, a grade revision will be submitted based on the results of the final exam and other course work. Failure to write the final exam at the next SAF identified opportunity will result in a course grade based on the elements of the course that were completed. </p><p>If a student does not utilize one of the indicated approved methods that can justify missing an assessment (and receive some sort of accommodation) or if the request through the VIF or Extenuating Circumstances System is not approved, the student will receive 0 for that course element missed. <br/><br/>It is important to understand and properly utilize the appropriate process. Indicating that someone did not know of a process will not be an accepted justification.</p><h4>Declaring absences </h4><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest</u>. This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness</strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodation, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Abse nce Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodation, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture </h4><p>In addition to any other language addressing recording of lectures in this outline, when permission is granted the use of all course recordings is strictly limited to the purpose of private/personal study and for no other reason (e.g., loaning the recording or reproducing a copy for another student, contesting grading, posting in whole or part online, etc.). Any failure to abide by these requirements is a violation of the university's academic integrity requirements and is subject to proceedings under Policy 71, Student Discipline and Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour.  </p><h4>Attendance at the Registered Section</h4><p>You are assigned to a specific section for instructor grading and office hours. If you require a change, please contact an SAF Advisor. It is not appropriate to attend a session you are not enrolled in, without talking to the instructor first. Failure to attend the registered section can result in negative grade consequences (e.g., participation) and students cannot assert that they were otherwise not aware there could be potential negative grade outcomes associated with not attending their registered section.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. </p><p>Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information">Quest</a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
