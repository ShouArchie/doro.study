</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>This course covers various topics in Corporate Finance, building on the theory of financial management developed in your earlier courses (AFM 273/274 or AFM 272/372). The objective is to broaden and deepen your understanding of the real decisions facing financial managers and investors. The course is grounded in corporate finance theory, providing cases and applications to develop your analytical and practical skills, business acumen, ability to communicate your understanding orally and in writing, and converse in mainstream issues relating to corporate finance in business. The course includes a substantial class participation requirement, and correspondingly, a significant amount of preparation for each class.</p><p>The classes encompass both case analysis and discussion of articles from practice-oriented academic journals. The material leads to a practical, in-depth application of many corporate finance competencies for decision-making purposes, including forecasting financing needs, the cost of capital, corporate performance measurement, capital budgeting, capital structure policy, securities issuance, dividend policy, valuation, M&amp;A, and restructurings. The analysis incorporates a number of general themes in corporate finance, including managerial objectives, corporate governance and value creation.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Individual In-Class Oral Contribution (16%)</strong></p><p>First please note that, to encourage original thought and ensure fairness, on the day of the case class you may not discuss the day’s case (or obtain notes from) even with current students who have already been in an earlier-timed (i.e., same-day) section of the case.</p><p>Individual student oral participation is strongly encouraged during each class -- your contributions will be recorded by an in-class TA and your grade will largely reflect the quality of your contribution as judged by the professor. Class discussions will focus on the posted material relating to each case or reading. However, the discussion is not constrained to that material – original thought and contributions are always encouraged. </p><p>A seating chart will be used: in order to gain full credit for your contributions, you must i) sit in the same seat every class ii) display every class (visibly) a large, clear name tag containing the name you wish to be called.</p><p><u>Grading</u></p><p>Contributions are recorded and ranked by an in-class TA according to the following rubric:</p><ul><li><i>Tier-1 (1-point): </i>Low quality contributions. For example, either answering one "yes/no" type question, asking an administrative question, or reading an answer off your screen verbatim.</li><li><i>Tier-2 (2-points): </i>High quality contributions. For example, either one thoughtful and thorough answer to a student/instructor question, or one thoughtful question that led to class discussion.</li></ul><p>Your participation mark for each class is calculated out of 3 contribution points. You may “over-score” for a particular class but only up to 4 points (i.e. the maximum per class score is 4/3 = 133%); therefore, consistent attendance and contribution throughout the semester is very important. However, to allow for the possibility of illness and incapacity, two classes will be dropped from your participation mark. Your contribution scores for each class are then tallied up and averaged to arrive at your final mark for the semester. </p><p>While not directly factored into your contribution score, attendance is recorded each class and the professor reserves the right to take attendance into consideration in the determination of the final contribution mark awarded at the end of the semester.</p><p>Please note that the “Use of Artificial Intelligence” section of this syllabus applies to the Participation component of your grade. Use of GenAI, such as ChatGPT, is not permitted whatsoever in-class. Students caught using GenAI in class will be penalized in accordance with University policy.</p><p><u>Class Preparation</u></p><p>The time required to prepare for each class is substantial. Students should read through the case/article, and then attempt the case questions returning to the relevant areas of the reading as appropriate. The advance questions/notes identify areas of focus for each class. You are expected to arrive in class having read any assigned materials and attempted the advance questions assigned. Be prepared to explain and expand upon your answers. Also prepare your own questions or ideas.</p><p><u>Class Oral Contribution </u></p><p>This involves making a meaningful contribution to the learning of the class. Potential contributions include: identifying the major issues within the topic of discussion, answering questions, asking constructive questions, providing constructive criticism, contributing comments, opinions or ideas. In the best scenario, your contributions will be made voluntarily; however, students will be called upon (“cold-called”) if needed to improve the distribution of contributions across students. The instructors will employ methods to actively seek to give opportunity to all students in the class to contribute, which may include (but is not necessarily limited to) asking questions that only students who have not yet contributed in a given class may answer.</p><p><u>Attendance, Punctuality &amp; Engagement</u></p><p>You may have isolated occasions where you unavoidably miss a class in addition to the two classes already dropped from your attendance record. If the occasion is foreseeable, self-declare your absence in Quest and provide a brief explanatory email to the instructor. Any and all other exemptions from participation always require a signed Verification of Illness (“VIF”) form submitted in accordance with University policy. You are responsible for catching up on missed material. Listening to others and respecting their points of view is an essential part of engaging in class. The following will negatively affect contribution grades: In-class internet/email usage (unless we are all visiting a specific website for pedagogic purposes), instant messaging, texting, gaming, etc. Turn off all mobile phones during class. Repeated absences, particularly absences without notification and justification, will also negatively affect your participation grade.</p><p><strong>Individual Case Synopses (14%)</strong></p><p>Each student is responsible for completing a brief (maximum 1 page + exhibits) synopsis for nine of the specified cases indicated on the <i>Class Schedule and Materials</i> page on LEARN.</p><p>To allow for the possibility of illness and incapacity, only your best seven submissions will count. <u>Any and all other exemptions from submission of assignments require a signed Verification of Illness (“VIF”) form submitted in accordance with University policy</u>. </p><p>The synopses must be submitted to the LEARN dropbox <strong>before 8:00 AM </strong>on the related class date. Due to the connection to class preparation, <strong>late submissions will not be accepted</strong>. You should allow time for contingencies such as slow internet.</p><p>Your submitted synopsis must represent your <strong>own work:</strong> </p><ul><li>You are permitted to discuss your preparation with colleagues currently enrolled in the course.</li><li>You are not permitted to discuss with students who have previously been exposed to the case/course, nor to obtain notes/solutions from them, or from other sources.</li><li>Furthermore, please note that the “Use of Artificial Intelligence” section of this syllabus applies to the Case Assignment component of your grade. Use of GenAI, such as ChatGPT, is not permitted in the preparation of case assignments. Students caught using GenAI for case assignments will be penalized in accordance with University policy. The instructors reserve the right to use software, such as Turnitin, to detect content generated by AI and determine appropriate penalties.</li></ul><p>Each synopsis must conform to the specifications listed below. Any deviation from these typesetting standards above will result in a <strong>mark deduction</strong>.</p><ul><li>Each submission should be a <strong>single file</strong> (i.e., a PDF/Word file that integrates any exhibits).</li><li>Synopsis <strong>1-page </strong>maximum. Plus any excel exhibits in an appendix <i>integrated</i> into the report. The 1-page limit does not include any appendices that contain relevant quantitative (excel) calculations. They should be referenced and analyzed in the main report 1 pages (i.e., if you put verbal analysis in the appendix it will not be marked).</li><li>8.5 x 11 inches document, typed, with 1-inch margins (top, bottom, right, and left).</li><li>Single spaced with minimum 11-point, Times New Roman font.</li></ul><p>Students should choose a format appropriate for each case, following these guidelines:</p><ol><li>Read the case and the advance slides posted by the professor (on LEARN). The advance student slides will identify any specific requirements for each case.</li><li>Frame the Key Issue(s) and Decision(s) in the Case. Why are they important?</li><li>Attempt any relevant Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis to compare alternatives (attach any relevant spreadsheet analysis as an appendix in your pdf/word file).</li><li>Make a Reasoned Recommendation - stating which alternative is preferable, based on your analysis. What are the key sources of risk and uncertainty?</li></ol><p>The added familiarity provided by the synopses is additionally important because the exams will be based at least partially on problems raised by the cases covered in class, and individual in-class oral contribution will stem from your synopsis preparation. </p><p><strong>Case Assignments (10%)</strong></p><p>Each student is responsible for submitting two case assignments during the semester. Unlike the case synopses, these assignments will be written under a time constraint and will involve answering specific questions regarding the particular case. </p><p><strong>Midterm (30%) and Final (30%) Exams</strong></p><p>The exams are closed book, based mainly on the material focused on in class (though technically, all material in the required readings is eligible). Laptop computers are permitted. The exam locations will be available from the administration.</p><p>Midterm grades may be appealed in writing only, <strong>within 7 days</strong> of papers having been made available to be handed back during class. Appealed grades may go up or down.</p><p>Faculty of Arts policy provides that students who wish to review their final exam papers informally may do so without instituting a formal appeal procedure. Such review will take place under supervised access by the SAF Course Management Coordinator only and will be arranged in a way that is mutually convenient for both parties.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, <i>[insert relevant course-specific Learning Outcomes]</i>.  Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p><h4>School of Accounting and Finance Academic Integrity Expectations</h4><p>Students at Waterloo and in SAF are expected to act with integrity, even when faced with difficult situations. Integrity is the cornerstone of the accounting and finance professions. What you practice at the University of Waterloo and in SAF will inform and even define who you are as an A&amp;F professional. As a student at the University of Waterloo and in SAF you are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, avoid committing offences and take responsibility for your actions. While there are common university wide expectations, you will also be expected to know and comply with course specific expectations as well. Participating in the course introduction and reviewing the course syllabus are basic expectations and are helpful regarding course specific academic requirements.</p><p>Policy 71 governs student discipline on campus and SAF works with the Associate Deans of a student’s home faculty when reporting academic misconduct. All suspected academic misconduct, regardless of type or severity, is reported to the appropriate Associate Dean who will review the evidence and apply the appropriate discipline and penalties.</p><p>Specific considerations for SAF students:</p><ul><li>Students majoring in accounting and finance programs at UWaterloo should be aware that, due to the highly structured nature of the study plans and the fact that many AFM courses are offered on a limited basis, a penalty imposed because of an academic offence could result in a significant delay of the student’s degree completion and convocation dates - particularly if the penalty involves a suspension.</li><li>Students placed on disciplinary probation will not be granted access to activities where they are viewed as SAF representatives. For example, students represent SAF in the AFM Fellowship Program, the Student Investment or Venture Fund, at case competitions, as TAs or Research Assistants, and as recruitment ambassadors. This is not an exhaustive list. When applying to participate in these activities, students are expected to declare if they are/are not on disciplinary probation. Normally, this access is denied for a period that spans two complete academic terms subsequent to the term in which the offence occurs.</li></ul><p>The academic integrity expectations for each of the assessments in this course have been outlined above as have the potentially unique implications for SAF students who fail to meet integrity expectations. These expectations are provided for further clarity and accompany the expectations outlined below in the discipline section (University Policy) and do not replace or reduce the importance of these expectations. If ever you are unsure about what’s expected of you, you are responsible for seeking clarification from an appropriate source. “I did not know” is not an acceptable personal justification or formal defense to an allegation.</p><h4>Submission Times </h4><p>Please be aware that the University of Waterloo is located in the Eastern Time Zone (GMT or UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time) and, as such, the time for your activities and/or assignments are due is based on this zone. If you are completing a course online and are outside of the Eastern Time Zone and require assistance converting your time, please try the <a href="https://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_CA-ON.aspx">Ontario, Canada Time Converter</a>. Students are expected to attend and adhere to the course timing set through the Schedule of Classes.</p><h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances</h4><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spaces/">multi-faith spaces</a> that students can use for faith-based practices. </p><h4>SAF Process for Missed Assessments</h4><p>Students are expected to complete all course assessments and write examinations as scheduled; however, there may be circumstances where accommodating a missed assessment is approved. <strong>See your course syllabus for specific accommodation policies that apply to your course.</strong> It is possible the syllabus will identify a process that renders redundant any need to formally declare an absence by means discussed below (e.g., for regular quizzes perhaps the syllabus will identify that only x of y attempts will be included in the final grade).<br/><br/>Review “<strong>Declaring Absences</strong>” below for instructions on how to declare absences and request accommodations for missed course component(s). To be considered for an academic accommodation, SAF students must follow the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Arts Accommodations for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances</a>. <br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation for a missed assessment is approved</u>, the student is responsible for contacting instructor to discuss accommodation arrangements. The instructor will determine the appropriate accommodation.<br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation is approved regarding a missed final exam</u>, the student needs to consult with the course instructor about writing a deferred final exam. In this case, the University of Waterloo Incomplete (INC) grade process will be followed, where all course requirements are not completed during the term. It is important to understand that, particularly with a cooperative education program, it is possible a deferred writing date will not be perfectly convenient to the student. If necessary, a CEE representative may be able to assist a student in their communications with an employer, however, it is still the student’s responsibility to initiate and manage any such process. Other than in exceptional circumstances, students are expected to prioritize writing the exam and completing the course (including making necessary arrangements for time away from work and being on campus). At the end of the current term, students will receive an INC course grade. Once the final exam has been written, a grade revision will be submitted based on the results of the final exam and other course work. Failure to write the final exam at the next SAF identified opportunity will result in a course grade based on the elements of the course that were completed. </p><p>If a student does not utilize one of the indicated approved methods that can justify missing an assessment (and receive some sort of accommodation) or if the request through the VIF or Extenuating Circumstances System is not approved, the student will receive 0 for that course element missed. <br/><br/>It is important to understand and properly utilize the appropriate process. Indicating that someone did not know of a process will not be an accepted justification.</p><h4>Declaring absences </h4><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest</u>. This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness</strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodation, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Abse nce Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodation, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture </h4><p>In addition to any other language addressing recording of lectures in this outline, when permission is granted the use of all course recordings is strictly limited to the purpose of private/personal study and for no other reason (e.g., loaning the recording or reproducing a copy for another student, contesting grading, posting in whole or part online, etc.). Any failure to abide by these requirements is a violation of the university's academic integrity requirements and is subject to proceedings under Policy 71, Student Discipline and Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour.  </p><h4>Attendance at the Registered Section</h4><p>You are assigned to a specific section for instructor grading and office hours. If you require a change, please contact an SAF Advisor. It is not appropriate to attend a session you are not enrolled in, without talking to the instructor first. Failure to attend the registered section can result in negative grade consequences (e.g., participation) and students cannot assert that they were otherwise not aware there could be potential negative grade outcomes associated with not attending their registered section.</p>
