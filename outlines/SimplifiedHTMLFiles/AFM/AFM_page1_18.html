<ul><li>In Class Quizzes:  The quizzes will cover all materials assign prior to the quiz. The quiz questions may be either multiple choice or true/ false questions.</li><li>Participation: Participation will be assessed by the instructors based on class attendance and participation of class discussion. There will be a self-reported discussion tracking sheet for students.</li><li>Individual Assignments: There will be three individual assignments with the following due dates: The end of Weeks 4, 6, and 8, respectively. All assessments/examinations must be the exclusive work of the individual student.</li><li>Group Assignments:  All group members must contribute their fair share to each assignment. Each group report is assigned a mark. Group members can choose one of the following to receive their individual mark: (1) each group member shares the same group mark; or (2) each group member receives a mark that is weighted by peer evaluation. Should any significant teamwork issues arise, see your instructor as soon as the issue occurs, not after the assignment has been evaluated. At times group members may not agree on each other’s contribution and the second grading scheme is chosen. In that case, we will post a detail peer evaluation form on Learn. In the extreme case that a group member has a zero contribution to the grading component, the group member will receive a zero mark.</li><li>Exams: There is no mid-term exam for this course. The final examination will be two and one-half hours duration and will be scheduled by the Registrar’s Office during the Winter 2024 term. The final examination is comprehensive, covering all material delivered throughout the course.</li></ul><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>1. Information on Python Tutorial:</p><p>Assignments will be based on the coding language of Python. Aside from in-class Python tutorials, Python tutorial sessions will be run by TAs throughout the course with the following schedule. </p><p><strong>Every other Friday afternoon 5:30pm, on Teams (a class Teams will be available), tentatively, on Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8.</strong></p><p>The attendance of these tutorial sessions is not required but highly recommended. If you’re new to coding in Python, attending these sessions will significantly benefit you in this course.</p><p>2. Assignments/reports will not be accepted after the due date. Please watch Learn announcements on due dates and leave yourself plenty of time to submit. Tentative assignment due dates will be released in class.</p><p>3. All group members must contribute their fair share to each assignment. Each group report is assigned a mark. Group members can choose one of the following to receive their individual mark: (1) each group member shares the same group mark; or (2) each group member receives a mark that is weighted by peer evaluation. At times group members may not agree on each other’s contribution and the second grading scheme is chosen. In that case, I will post a detail peer evaluation form on Learn. In the extreme case that a group member has a zero contribution to the grading component, the group member will receive a zero mark.</p><p>4. Requests for re-grading must be made within one week after it has been given back and must be in writing. <i>Note that the instructor reserves the right to re-grade the entire test and raise or lower the grades originally assigned</i>. This is important as “shopping” for a higher grade is a bad strategy and has resulted in lower grades in other courses/iterations taught by this instructor.</p><p>5. Generative AI</p><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills of the Python coding of analytics exercises. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p>6. Other policies not covered here: Details regarding School of Accounting and Finance (SAF) policies and University of Waterloo policies can be found on the SAF LEARN site “My SAF Community” at: <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/le/content/66209/Home?returnPoint=1&amp;ou=66209">https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/le/content/66209/Home?returnPoint=1&amp;ou=66209</a> within the Learn – SAF Course Syllabus – Policies for Students folder.</p><h4>School of Accounting and Finance Academic Integrity Expectations</h4><p>Students at Waterloo and in SAF are expected to act with integrity, even when faced with difficult situations. Integrity is the cornerstone of the accounting and finance professions. What you practice at the University of Waterloo and in SAF will inform and even define who you are as an A&amp;F professional. As a student at the University of Waterloo and in SAF you are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, avoid committing offences and take responsibility for your actions. While there are common university wide expectations, you will also be expected to know and comply with course specific expectations as well. Participating in the course introduction and reviewing the course syllabus are basic expectations and are helpful regarding course specific academic requirements.</p><p>Policy 71 governs student discipline on campus and SAF works with the Associate Deans of a student’s home faculty when reporting academic misconduct. All suspected academic misconduct, regardless of type or severity, is reported to the appropriate Associate Dean who will review the evidence and apply the appropriate discipline and penalties.</p><p>Specific considerations for SAF students:</p><ul><li>Students majoring in accounting and finance programs at UWaterloo should be aware that, due to the highly structured nature of the study plans and the fact that many AFM courses are offered on a limited basis, a penalty imposed because of an academic offence could result in a significant delay of the student’s degree completion and convocation dates - particularly if the penalty involves a suspension.</li><li>Students placed on disciplinary probation will not be granted access to activities where they are viewed as SAF representatives. For example, students represent SAF in the AFM Fellowship Program, the Student Investment or Venture Fund, at case competitions, as TAs or Research Assistants, and as recruitment ambassadors. This is not an exhaustive list. When applying to participate in these activities, students are expected to declare if they are/are not on disciplinary probation. Normally, this access is denied for a period that spans two complete academic terms subsequent to the term in which the offence occurs.</li></ul><p>The academic integrity expectations for each of the assessments in this course have been outlined above as have the potentially unique implications for SAF students who fail to meet integrity expectations. These expectations are provided for further clarity and accompany the expectations outlined below in the discipline section (University Policy) and do not replace or reduce the importance of these expectations. If ever you are unsure about what’s expected of you, you are responsible for seeking clarification from an appropriate source. “I did not know” is not an acceptable personal justification or formal defense to an allegation.</p><h4>Submission Times </h4><p>Please be aware that the University of Waterloo is located in the Eastern Time Zone (GMT or UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time) and, as such, the time for your activities and/or assignments are due is based on this zone. If you are completing a course online and are outside of the Eastern Time Zone and require assistance converting your time, please try the <a href="https://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_CA-ON.aspx">Ontario, Canada Time Converter</a>. Students are expected to attend and adhere to the course timing set through the Schedule of Classes.</p><h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances</h4><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spaces/">multi-faith spaces</a> that students can use for faith-based practices. </p><h4>SAF Process for Missed Assessments</h4><p>Students are expected to complete all course assessments and write examinations as scheduled; however, there may be circumstances where accommodating a missed assessment is approved. <strong>See your course syllabus for specific accommodation policies that apply to your course.</strong> It is possible the syllabus will identify a process that renders redundant any need to formally declare an absence by means discussed below (e.g., for regular quizzes perhaps the syllabus will identify that only x of y attempts will be included in the final grade).<br/><br/>Review “<strong>Declaring Absences</strong>” below for instructions on how to declare absences and request accommodations for missed course component(s). To be considered for an academic accommodation, SAF students must follow the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Arts Accommodations for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances</a>. <br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation for a missed assessment is approved</u>, the student is responsible for contacting instructor to discuss accommodation arrangements. The instructor will determine the appropriate accommodation.<br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation is approved regarding a missed final exam</u>, the student needs to consult with the course instructor about writing a deferred final exam. In this case, the University of Waterloo Incomplete (INC) grade process will be followed, where all course requirements are not completed during the term. It is important to understand that, particularly with a cooperative education program, it is possible a deferred writing date will not be perfectly convenient to the student. If necessary, a CEE representative may be able to assist a student in their communications with an employer, however, it is still the student’s responsibility to initiate and manage any such process. Other than in exceptional circumstances, students are expected to prioritize writing the exam and completing the course (including making necessary arrangements for time away from work and being on campus). At the end of the current term, students will receive an INC course grade. Once the final exam has been written, a grade revision will be submitted based on the results of the final exam and other course work. Failure to write the final exam at the next SAF identified opportunity will result in a course grade based on the elements of the course that were completed. </p><p>If a student does not utilize one of the indicated approved methods that can justify missing an assessment (and receive some sort of accommodation) or if the request through the VIF or Extenuating Circumstances System is not approved, the student will receive 0 for that course element missed. <br/><br/>It is important to understand and properly utilize the appropriate process. Indicating that someone did not know of a process will not be an accepted justification.</p><h4>Declaring absences </h4><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest</u>. This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness</strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodation, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Abse nce Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodation, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture </h4><p>In addition to any other language addressing recording of lectures in this outline, when permission is granted the use of all course recordings is strictly limited to the purpose of private/personal study and for no other reason (e.g., loaning the recording or reproducing a copy for another student, contesting grading, posting in whole or part online, etc.). Any failure to abide by these requirements is a violation of the university's academic integrity requirements and is subject to proceedings under Policy 71, Student Discipline and Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour.  </p><h4>Attendance at the Registered Section</h4><p>You are assigned to a specific section for instructor grading and office hours. If you require a change, please contact an SAF Advisor. It is not appropriate to attend a session you are not enrolled in, without talking to the instructor first. Failure to attend the registered section can result in negative grade consequences (e.g., participation) and students cannot assert that they were otherwise not aware there could be potential negative grade outcomes associated with not attending their registered section.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>.
