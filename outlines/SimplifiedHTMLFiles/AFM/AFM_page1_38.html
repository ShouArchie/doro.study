<div>AFM 322:</div>
<p>Introduction to valuation and applications of financial derivatives such as options, futures, forwards, and swaps.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this course is to provide students with a working knowledge of how derivatives can be used in managing financial risks. Corporations and financial institutions face financial risks arising from changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and stock prices. Forwards, futures, options and other derivative products have become essential tools for hedging and controlling these financial risks. These products are usually more complicated than traditional cash instruments such as stocks and bonds and require more than just basic analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Participation (10%)</strong></p><p>Individual student participation is strongly encouraged. Your participation grade will largely reflect the consistency of your attendance and the quality of your contribution as judged by the professor. </p><p>A seating chart will be used: in order to gain full credit for your contributions, you must i) sit in the same seat every class ii) display every class (visibly) a large, clear name tag containing the name you wish to be called.</p><p>Half of your participation mark is attendance. The other half is comprised of your contributions. Contributions are recorded and ranked by an in-class TA according to the following rubric:</p><ul><li><i>Attendance (2 points): </i>Attending class on time and without distractions (e.g. social media, headphones, texting, etc).</li><li><i>Tier-1 Contributions (1 point): </i>Low-quality contributions. For example, either answering one "yes/no" type question, asking an administrative question, or reading an answer off your screen verbatim.</li><li><i>Tier 2 Contributions (2 points): </i>High-quality contributions. For example, either one thoughtful and thorough answer to a student/instructor question, or one thoughtful question that led to class discussion.</li></ul><p>Your participation mark for each class is calculated out of 4 contribution points. You may “over-score” for a particular class but only up to 5 points (i.e. the maximum per class score is 5/4 = 125%); therefore, <strong>consistent</strong> attendance and contribution throughout the semester is very important. Your contribution scores for each class are then tallied up and averaged to arrive at your final mark for the semester.</p><p>In addition to the above, student activity on Piazza (meaning, accurately and thoroughly answering other students’ questions) will be counted as a bonus when determining participation marks. </p><p>Class discussions will focus on the posted material relating to each reading. However, the discussion is not constrained to that material – original thought and contributions are always encouraged. You are expected to arrive in class having read any assigned materials and attempted the problem sets. Be prepared to explain and expand upon your answers. Also, prepare your own questions or ideas.</p><p>Potential quality contributions include: identifying the major issues within the topic of discussion (helping to ‘set-up’ analysis), answering questions, asking constructive questions, providing constructive criticism, contributing comments, opinions or ideas. In the best scenario, your contributions will be made voluntarily; however, students will be called upon (“cold-called”) if needed to improve class discussion.</p><p><strong>Attendance, Punctuality &amp; Engagement </strong></p><p>You may have isolated occasions where you unavoidably miss a class. If the occasion is foreseeable, <u>self-declare your absence in Quest </u>and provide a brief explanatory email to the instructor. All other absences <u>require a VIF </u>to be exempted from assessments. You are responsible for catching up on missed material. Listening to others and respecting their points of view is an essential part of engaging in class. The following will negatively affect contribution grades: In-class internet/email usage (unless we are all visiting a specific website for pedagogic purposes), instant messaging, texting, gaming, etc. Turn off all mobile phones during class. Repeated absences, particularly absences without notification and justification, will also negatively affect your participation grade.</p><p><strong>Paper-Trading Assignment (15%)</strong><br/>You will engage in an interactive simulation of scenarios that involve derivative trading, which will involve using trading platforms and tracking performance in a system colloquially referred to as “paper-trading”. You will explore the different types and uses for derivatives in a hands-on and practical way, and will be responsible to deliver a full report documenting your performance and experience at the end of the semester. A full description of the report can be found on Learn under the Paper-Trading Assignment tab.</p><p><strong>Group Cases (15%)</strong></p><p>Four finance cases worth 15% in total (i.e. 3.75% each) will be completed throughout the term (see the course calendar). These cases will be completed in-class and in teams of four or five students. Your group will start by reviewing and discussing the case in detail prior to the day of the in-class assignment. On case day, the professor will introduce the case and give guidance prior to the start of the in-class case assignment. Your group will then be given the case requirement page outlining the questions that you will submit answers to on the 2-3 page case requirement summary. Groups will have approximately 60-minutes to complete the case requirement. One case requirement will be submitted per group and each student in the group will receive the same grade. Being absent on case day will result in a grade of zero for that particular student unless a verifiable excuse acceptable to the professor is submitted.</p><p><strong>Working in Groups</strong><br/>You will form your own group of four or five students for the group assignments. Your group will work together for all of the cases in the term.</p><p><strong>Team Formation</strong><br/>You can form your own teams with the following conditions:</p><ol><li>You must have four or five members on your team unless the total size of the course does not allow this many.</li><li>Once you have your group formed, have one member select a group number from the available groups showing on the list and enroll.</li><li>That group member will let other group members know the group number that they should enroll in.</li><li>To enroll in your group, please follow these instructions:<br/>1) Log into D2L<br/>2) Select “Connect”<br/>3) Find “Enroll in a group for ‘Assignment Groups’<br/>4) Select [Choose Group]<br/>5) Select your group number as agreed with other group members<br/>6) Click “Select”</li></ol><p>On or before noon on Friday, January 17th you will have to set up your team on Learn. Those that do not have a team at this time will be randomly assigned a group within the next 48 hours.</p><p><strong>Midterm/Final Examinations (60%)</strong></p><p>Two written examinations worth (30% + 30%) = 60% in total will be completed on specific dates during the term (see the course calendar). There will be a midterm covering the first half of the course and a final exam in the final exam period covering the second half of the course. The final exam is not comprehensive. You must pass the weighted average of the midterm and the final examinations to pass the course (i.e. a weighted average score of at least 50%); if you do not pass the weighted average of the two exams, your final course grade will become the lesser of (a) the weighted average on the exams that you did achieve and (b) your course grade as otherwise calculated. Detailed announcements will be made on LEARN closer to the date of each exam providing more information. Both examinations will be written on campus so you must be available on each of these two dates and times.</p><p><strong>Exam Preparation</strong></p><p>You are expected to stay up to date with the course schedule and have read any assigned readings and slide decks, attempted any problems assigned, and prepared your own questions for posting on Piazza. For those not familiar with Piazza, it is a learning management system (LMS) which allows students to ask questions in a forum-type format. It is designed to connect students, TAs, and professors so that students can get help when they need it. Piazza will be the primary communication platform for the 322 community and is an essential component of any online course. The Lead TA will register the entire 322 community at the beginning of the term. </p><p>Several practice problem sets will be distributed throughout the term (after every module covered). They will primarily be similar to questions from the lecture decks. Your success in the course will depend on your ability to do questions similar to those assigned. Note that doing the questions from these practice problem sets at your own pace while consulting your course notes may not constitute good preparation for doing similar questions under the time pressure of an exam.</p><p><strong>Calculator</strong></p><p>In AFM 322 we will require the use of a calculator as Excel use is not permitted for the exams. A specific financial calculator is not required, but it is essential that the student’s calculator be able to handle exponents. The ability to store the results of calculations in the calculator’s memory is highly desirable as there will be numerical problems with multiple steps involved.</p><p><strong>Accommodations for Missed Assessments</strong></p><p>Students are expected to complete all course assessments and write examinations as scheduled; however, there may be circumstances where accommodating a missed assessment is approved. Accommodation is not automatic upon the presentation of documentation (i.e. a Verification of Illness Form - https://uwaterloo.ca/school-of-accounting-and-finance/request-academic-accommodation-saf-missed-assessment). Instructors will use the documentation along with all information available to them, when determining whether accommodation is warranted. If an accommodation for a missed course assessment is approved the instructor will determine the appropriate accommodation.  </p><p>To ensure fairness to all students, if you miss the midterm due to an accommodated absence, the weight of the midterm will be transferred to the final exam, and your final exam will also include the materials that were supposed to be tested on the midterm (i.e. the final exam will be cumulative).  If you miss the final exam, obtain appropriate documentation for an accommodation, and are given the option to write the exam during the make-up exam period or the next time the course is offered, you will receive an INC course grade at the end of the current term. When you have written the final exam, a grade revision will be submitted based on the results of the final exam and your other course work. Failure to write the final exam the next time the course is offered will result in a course grade-based on the elements of the course that you completed. </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>School of Accounting and Finance Academic Integrity Expectations</h4><p>Students at Waterloo and in SAF are expected to act with integrity, even when faced with difficult situations. Integrity is the cornerstone of the accounting and finance professions. What you practice at the University of Waterloo and in SAF will inform and even define who you are as an A&amp;F professional. As a student at the University of Waterloo and in SAF you are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, avoid committing offences and take responsibility for your actions. While there are common university wide expectations, you will also be expected to know and comply with course specific expectations as well. Participating in the course introduction and reviewing the course syllabus are basic expectations and are helpful regarding course specific academic requirements.</p><p>Policy 71 governs student discipline on campus and SAF works with the Associate Deans of a student’s home faculty when reporting academic misconduct. All suspected academic misconduct, regardless of type or severity, is reported to the appropriate Associate Dean who will review the evidence and apply the appropriate discipline and penalties.</p><p>Specific considerations for SAF students:</p><ul><li>Students majoring in accounting and finance programs at UWaterloo should be aware that, due to the highly structured nature of the study plans and the fact that many AFM courses are offered on a limited basis, a penalty imposed because of an academic offence could result in a significant delay of the student’s degree completion and convocation dates - particularly if the penalty involves a suspension.</li><li>Students placed on disciplinary probation will not be granted access to activities where they are viewed as SAF representatives. For example, students represent SAF in the AFM Fellowship Program, the Student Investment or Venture Fund, at case competitions, as TAs or Research Assistants, and as recruitment ambassadors. This is not an exhaustive list. When applying to participate in these activities, students are expected to declare if they are/are not on disciplinary probation. Normally, this access is denied for a period that spans two complete academic terms subsequent to the term in which the offence occurs.</li></ul><p>The academic integrity expectations for each of the assessments in this course have been outlined above as have the potentially unique implications for SAF students who fail to meet integrity expectations. These expectations are provided for further clarity and accompany the expectations outlined below in the discipline section (University Policy) and do not replace or reduce the importance of these expectations. If ever you are unsure about what’s expected of you, you are responsible for seeking clarification from an appropriate source. “I did not know” is not an acceptable personal justification or formal defense to an allegation.</p><h4>Submission Times </h4><p>Please be aware that the University of Waterloo is located in the Eastern Time Zone (GMT or UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time) and, as such, the time for your activities and/or assignments are due is based on this zone. If you are completing a course online and are outside of the Eastern Time Zone and require assistance converting your time, please try the <a href="https://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_CA-ON.aspx">Ontario, Canada Time Converter</a>. Students are expected to attend and adhere to the course timing set through the Schedule of Classes.</p><h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances</h4><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spaces/">multi-faith spaces</a> that students can use for faith-based practices. </p><h4>SAF Process for Missed Assessments</h4><p>Students are expected to complete all course assessments and write examinations as scheduled; however, there may be circumstances where accommodating a missed assessment is approved. <strong>See your course syllabus for specific accommodation policies that apply to your course.</strong> It is possible the syllabus will identify a process that renders redundant any need to formally declare an absence by means discussed below (e.g., for regular quizzes perhaps the syllabus will identify that only x of y attempts will be included in the final grade).<br/><br/>Review “<strong>Declaring Absences</strong>” below for instructions on how to declare absences and request accommodations for missed course component(s). To be considered for an academic accommodation, SAF students must follow the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Arts Accommodations for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances</a>. <br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation for a missed assessment is approved</u>, the student is responsible for contacting instructor to discuss accommodation arrangements. The instructor will determine the appropriate accommodation.<br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation is approved regarding a missed final exam</u>, the student needs to consult with the course instructor about writing a deferred final exam. In this case, the University of Waterloo Incomplete (INC) grade process will be followed, where all course requirements are not completed during the term. It is important to understand that, particularly with a cooperative education program, it is possible a deferred writing date will not be perfectly convenient to the student. If necessary, a CEE representative may be able to assist a student in their communications with an employer, however, it is still the student’s responsibility to initiate and manage any such process. Other than in exceptional circumstances, students are expected to prioritize writing the exam and completing the course (including making necessary arrangements for time away from work and being on campus). At the end of the current term, students will receive an INC course grade. Once the final exam has been written, a grade revision will be submitted based on the results of the final exam and other course work. Failure to write the final exam at the next SAF identified opportunity will result in a course grade based on the elements of the course that were completed. </p><p>If a student does not utilize one of the indicated approved methods that can justify missing an assessment (and receive some sort of accommodation) or if the request through the VIF or Extenuating Circumstances System is not approved, the student will receive 0 for that course element missed. <br/><br/>It is important to understand and properly utilize the appropriate process. Indicating that someone did not know of a process will not be an accepted justification.</p><h4>Declaring absences </h4><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest</u>.
