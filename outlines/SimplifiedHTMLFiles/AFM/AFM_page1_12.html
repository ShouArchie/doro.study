<p>This course focuses on the fundamentals of inferential statistics. Throughout the course, we aim to answer an important question: <i>How can we make reliable inferences about a population based on the limited information in a sample?</i> Specifically, this course will introduce key statistical concepts, including probability distribution, sampling distribution, the central limit theorem, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and simple linear regression. Moreover, students will also apply these analytical and statistical methods using R in various accounting and finance contexts.</p>

<h3>Tutorial session attendance</h3><p>Attendance at the weekly tutorial sessions is mandatory for students. In these sessions, students will revisit the analysis presented in lectures. Tutorial leaders and TAs will guide students through additional exercises, providing hands-on assistance in applying lecture concepts. To receive attendance credit, students must demonstrate their work to tutorial leaders or TAs at the end of each session.</p><ul><li>There are, in total, nine (9) tutorial sessions throughout the term.</li><li>You can drop the two (2) lowest tutorial session attendance scores at the end of the term.</li><li>If you miss just one (1) tutorial session <strong>for any reason</strong>, it must be one of the two lowest scores you can drop.</li><li>If you miss a week or more of classes due to health or personal issues, please report it using the ARTS self-accommodation <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">link</a>. Once again, if you miss just one (1) tutorial session, it will be one of the lowest two tutorial session attendance scores that you automatically drop.</li></ul><h3>Written assignments</h3><p>There are two (2) written assignments throughout the term. Both assignments are <strong>non-cumulative</strong>. The first intends to assess students’ understanding of topics and concepts covered from Week 2 to Week 5. The second one will cover the materials between Week 9 and Week 11. The assignment will feature a variety of question types, including multiple-choice, true/false, numeric questions (based on completion of R script analysis of assigned datasets), and short-answer questions (a short paragraph of 2 to 3 sentences at most).</p><ul><li>Both assignments are open books and open notes. However, it would be best to work on the assignment by yourself.</li><li>There are <strong>no</strong> make-ups for any of the assignments missed. Each one will account for 10% of the final course grade. <ul><li>If you miss the first assignment<strong> for any reason</strong>, we will transfer the 10% weight to the midterm exam. In this case, the updated midterm exam weight is 25% (from 15%).</li><li>If you miss the second assignment<strong> for any reason</strong>, we will transfer the 10% weight to the final exam. In this case, the updated final exam weight is 40% (from 30%).</li><li>If you miss both assignments <strong>for any reason</strong>, we will transfer assignment 1’s weight of 10% to the midterm exam. Assignment 2 will be graded as 0.</li></ul></li><li>You will have seven (7) days to complete each assignment, which will be submitted and graded on Crowdmark. Once submitted, it is your responsibility to ensure that your work is clearly visible, rotated properly, and questions are uploaded in the correct place.</li></ul><h3>Team project</h3><p>Each team (4 or 5 members) will work on a business analytics case and prepare a report to communicate the data analysis results to a non-technical audience. The project details will be available on LEARN when we approach the week of Mar. 31, 2025.</p><h3>Midterm and final exams</h3><p>Both midterm and final exams are <strong>in-person </strong>and <strong>cumulative</strong>. You should expect to be tested on all materials, including but not limited to the teaching notes and the content of lectures and tutorial seminars. The midterm exam is scheduled for Feb. 26, 2025, from 6:00 pm to 7:20 pm. It will include all materials from the beginning of the course through week 7.</p><p>Written requests for re-grading a mid-term examination must normally be made <strong>within one week after the examination has been returned</strong>. A written request that indicates your reasons for believing a question was improperly graded must be submitted. The instructor reserves the right to re-grade the <strong>entire</strong> examination.</p><p>Faculty of Arts policy provides that students who wish to review their final examination papers informally may do so without instituting a formal appeal procedure. Such review will occur under supervised access only and be arranged in a mutually convenient way for the instructor and the student.</p><p>The final exam will be two and a half hours long and will be scheduled by the Registrar’s Office during the Winter 2025 term. The examination period is from Apr. 9 to Apr. 25. The final exam will cover all material delivered throughout the course. We will post the final exam details on LEARN once we know them.</p><p> </p>

<h3>Syllabus Updates</h3><p>The version of the syllabus published on Outline is considered an initial draft and serves as an incomplete contract. Any updates or modifications to the syllabus will be communicated through the version posted on the course website, LEARN. In the event of any discrepancies between the Outline syllabus and the LEARN syllabus, the LEARN syllabus will take precedence. Students are responsible for consulting the LEARN syllabus for the most accurate and up-to-date course information.</p><h3>Piazza</h3><p>In this term, we will use Piazza for class discussion. Given the size of the class, communications via email will not be practical. Unless you have an emergency requiring immediate attention or want to communicate a private issue, please post your questions in the appropriate Piazza folder. You can find our class page at: <a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/afm113">https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/afm113</a>.</p><h3>Late submission policy</h3><p><strong>Late submissions will be penalized at 4 points per hour late.</strong> Submissions are considered complete when the last required document has been submitted. For example, consider an assignment where students are required to submit file A and file B by 11:59 pm on Feb. 13. If a student submits file A at 10:00 pm on Feb. 13 and file B at 6:00 pm on Feb. 14, this student will have 24 points subtracted from their original grade. There are no exceptions to this rule without appropriate accommodations using the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">link</a>.</p><h3>Adverse weather</h3><p>When the campus is closed due to adverse weather, all learning activities, including lectures and tutorial sessions, will be transitioned to an online format. We will provide a Zoom or Microsoft Teams link in advance to facilitate this change.</p><h3>Unable to write midterm or final exam</h3><p>Suppose you cannot write the midterm and <strong>have a valid reason</strong> (i.e., you have submitted the appropriate supporting documentation to the SAF advisor). In that case, we will transfer the weight of your midterm to the final exam.</p><p>If you cannot write the final exam on the originally scheduled date and <strong>have a valid reason</strong>, you can write the final exam on an alternative date if your accommodation request is approved by the lecturer and the SAF. The lecturers will determine the make-up exam date and time. It could be at the end of the W25 term or in the next term when we offer the course. </p><h3>University, Faculty of Arts, and SAF policies</h3><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement.

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

Integrity is the cornerstone of the accounting and finance professions. What you practice at the University of Waterloo and in SAF will inform and even define who you are as an A&amp;F professional. As a student at the University of Waterloo and in SAF you are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, avoid committing offences and take responsibility for your actions. While there are common university wide expectations, you will also be expected to know and comply with course specific expectations as well. Participating in the course introduction and reviewing the course syllabus are basic expectations and are helpful regarding course specific academic requirements.</p><p>Policy 71 governs student discipline on campus and SAF works with the Associate Deans of a student’s home faculty when reporting academic misconduct. All suspected academic misconduct, regardless of type or severity, is reported to the appropriate Associate Dean who will review the evidence and apply the appropriate discipline and penalties.</p><p>Specific considerations for SAF students:</p><ul><li>Students majoring in accounting and finance programs at UWaterloo should be aware that, due to the highly structured nature of the study plans and the fact that many AFM courses are offered on a limited basis, a penalty imposed because of an academic offence could result in a significant delay of the student’s degree completion and convocation dates - particularly if the penalty involves a suspension.</li><li>Students placed on disciplinary probation will not be granted access to activities where they are viewed as SAF representatives. For example, students represent SAF in the AFM Fellowship Program, the Student Investment or Venture Fund, at case competitions, as TAs or Research Assistants, and as recruitment ambassadors. This is not an exhaustive list. When applying to participate in these activities, students are expected to declare if they are/are not on disciplinary probation. Normally, this access is denied for a period that spans two complete academic terms subsequent to the term in which the offence occurs.</li></ul><p>The academic integrity expectations for each of the assessments in this course have been outlined above as have the potentially unique implications for SAF students who fail to meet integrity expectations. These expectations are provided for further clarity and accompany the expectations outlined below in the discipline section (University Policy) and do not replace or reduce the importance of these expectations. If ever you are unsure about what’s expected of you, you are responsible for seeking clarification from an appropriate source. “I did not know” is not an acceptable personal justification or formal defense to an allegation.</p><h4>Submission Times </h4><p>Please be aware that the University of Waterloo is located in the Eastern Time Zone (GMT or UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time) and, as such, the time for your activities and/or assignments are due is based on this zone. If you are completing a course online and are outside of the Eastern Time Zone and require assistance converting your time, please try the <a href="https://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_CA-ON.aspx">Ontario, Canada Time Converter</a>. Students are expected to attend and adhere to the course timing set through the Schedule of Classes.</p><h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances</h4><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spaces/">multi-faith spaces</a> that students can use for faith-based practices. </p><h4>SAF Process for Missed Assessments</h4><p>Students are expected to complete all course assessments and write examinations as scheduled; however, there may be circumstances where accommodating a missed assessment is approved. <strong>See your course syllabus for specific accommodation policies that apply to your course.</strong> It is possible the syllabus will identify a process that renders redundant any need to formally declare an absence by means discussed below (e.g., for regular quizzes perhaps the syllabus will identify that only x of y attempts will be included in the final grade).<br/><br/>Review “<strong>Declaring Absences</strong>” below for instructions on how to declare absences and request accommodations for missed course component(s). To be considered for an academic accommodation, SAF students must follow the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Arts Accommodations for Illness or Extenuating Circumstances</a>. <br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation for a missed assessment is approved</u>, the student is responsible for contacting instructor to discuss accommodation arrangements. The instructor will determine the appropriate accommodation.<br/><br/>If an <u>accommodation is approved regarding a missed final exam</u>, the student needs to consult with the course instructor about writing a deferred final exam. In this case, the University of Waterloo Incomplete (INC) grade process will be followed, where all course requirements are not completed during the term. It is important to understand that, particularly with a cooperative education program, it is possible a deferred writing date will not be perfectly convenient to the student. If necessary, a CEE representative may be able to assist a student in their communications with an employer, however, it is still the student’s responsibility to initiate and manage any such process. Other than in exceptional circumstances, students are expected to prioritize writing the exam and completing the course (including making necessary arrangements for time away from work and being on campus). At the end of the current term, students will receive an INC course grade. Once the final exam has been written, a grade revision will be submitted based on the results of the final exam and other course work. Failure to write the final exam at the next SAF identified opportunity will result in a course grade based on the elements of the course that were completed. </p><p>If a student does not utilize one of the indicated approved methods that can justify missing an assessment (and receive some sort of accommodation) or if the request through the VIF or Extenuating Circumstances System is not approved, the student will receive 0 for that course element missed. <br/><br/>It is important to understand and properly utilize the appropriate process. Indicating that someone did not know of a process will not be an accepted justification.</p><h4>Declaring absences </h4><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest</u>. This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness</strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodation, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Abse nce Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodation, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture </h4><p>In addition to any other language addressing recording of lectures in this outline, when permission is granted the use of all course recordings is strictly limited to the purpose of private/personal study and for no other reason (e.g., loaning the recording or reproducing a copy for another student, contesting grading, posting in whole or part online, etc.). Any failure to abide by these requirements is a violation of the university's academic integrity requirements and is subject to proceedings under Policy 71, Student Discipline and Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour.  </p><h4>Attendance at the Registered Section</h4><p>You are assigned to a specific section for instructor grading and office hours. If you require a change, please contact an SAF Advisor. It is not appropriate to attend a session you are not enrolled in, without talking to the instructor first. Failure to attend the registered section can result in negative grade consequences (e.g., participation) and students cannot assert that they were otherwise not aware there could be potential negative grade outcomes associated with not attending their registered section.</p><h4><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement</strong></h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p>
