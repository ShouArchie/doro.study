<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>SOCWK 300R:</div>
<p>In this course students will gain an understanding of key concepts in social welfare policy as it has evolved in the post-industrial era and develop their skills in social policy research and analysis. Students will examine various social, economic, and political factors that shape Canadian social welfare policy, critically assess contemporary social policy, discuss policy change processes, and debate current controversies and dilemmas regarding capitalism and the welfare state.</p>

<h4>How we will learn together</h4><p>This course reflects the premise that knowledge is created and generated in multiple ways and that we must resist colonist hierarchies that privilege Western ontologies over other ways of knowing and being. To this end, the readings, activities, videos, and assignments that I have curated in this course draw on various ways of knowing and learning. Each week will combine a mix of reading, viewing/listening, discussion, and short written reviews.</p><p>My intention in developing this course is to create a virtual space in which you and your classmates can grapple with the course materials in a respectful and thoughtful manner; unlike Twitter or the Facebook comments section, this is a space for careful, humble, and serious discussion and debate. It is a space in which each of us should be open to being challenged about our opinions and positions, but also a space where critiques are tempered by the understanding that each of us is entering the dialogue with a desire to learn and change. Our aim is to create a rare online space of care, mutual respect, accountability and trust.</p><p>Along with being a space of learning, our class is also a space in which to identify and resist the structures of oppression that permeate societal structures as well as our day-to-day interactions. To this end, I urge each of you to be self-reflexive about how your behaviours or comments might reflect patriarchal, misogynist, classist, racism, homophobic, transphobic, or ableist relations of power. We are each in the process of learning and unlearning these logics that dominate our society, so there is no expectation here that any one of us is self-actualized and perfect; all I ask is that each of us be critically mindful of how what we think, say or do in interactions with others might be shaped by these forces.</p>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h3>Deadlines and Extensions Policy</h3><p>All submissions are due at <strong>11:59 PM Waterloo time</strong> (Eastern) on the day of the deadline.</p><p><strong>Extension Policy for Assignments*</strong></p><p>Sometimes life gets in the way of your studies. Perhaps you've been ill, someone in your family has died, you've had a lot of work in other classes, someone has broken your heart. Whatever the reason, you can always take advantage of the Extension Policy</p><p>Here's how it works:</p><ul><li>An Extension is automatic; there is no need to request one.</li><li>With an Extension, your Assignment is due <strong>3 </strong>da<strong>ys</strong> after the regular Deadline.</li><li>Students receiving an Extension will receive their work back within 10 days of submitting their Assignment.</li></ul><p><strong>No extensions for Assignments are granted beyond the 3 calendar days.</strong></p><p><strong>*Please note</strong>: The extended deadline policy does NOT apply to these assignments:</p><ul><li><strong>Declaration of Summative Plan (due February 2) - </strong>This is an ungraded task to declare your plan for individual or group formation for the Summative.  The extended deadline policy does not apply.</li><li><strong>Course Reflection (due April 6):</strong> Due to grade posting requirements, the extended deadline policy does not apply.</li></ul><p><strong>Use of Generative AI</strong></p><p>You are required to generate your own work in this class. Submitting content that has been generated by someone other than you, or was created by a computer application or tool, including artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT is cheating and constitutes an academic integrity violation. You may use simple word processing tools to update spelling and grammar in your assignments, but you may not use AI tools to draft your work, even if you edit, revise, or paraphrase it.</p><p>The easiest way to remember this is: If you didn't write it, don't put your name on it and claim that you wrote it. Don't modify a few words here and there and claim you wrote it.  Do your own analysis and critical thinking. In this course, you are building your skills in critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, analyzing and writing - use this opportunity to learn and grow by doing your own work. The process of completing the assessments is as much a part of the learning process as reading and viewing the course materials.</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence   </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
