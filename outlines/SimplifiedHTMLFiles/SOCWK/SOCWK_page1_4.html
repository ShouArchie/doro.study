A move towards this type of approach requires a greater time investment for both teaching staff and students with the hopes that it will create a more meaningful learning experience. You will be completing 3 group case studies throughout this term. I would like to express my deep gratitude towards my fellow professor, Dr. Craig Fortier for developing some of these case scenarios.<br/><br/><strong>Instructions </strong><br/>As a part of a group of 4-5 students, you will be required to review written material about specific case scenarios and fill out the appropriate decision making or case analysis sheet provided with each Case Study.<br/><br/><u>Note: Each group must calculate and include the word count for each question in (brackets) at the end of each response.</u><br/><br/><strong>Complete and submit the Group Case Studies</strong>.

After reviewing the associated weekly content, review the associated case study or case scenario. Download the decision-making tool or case analysis sheet relevant to the case scenario. </p><p>One group member will upload the decision-making tool or case analysis sheet to their Microsoft Office 365, OneDrive and share it for collaborative editing with the team members. </p><p>Tasks should be delegated among group members to complete the assignment.<br/><br/><strong>Include the names of group members who participate in the group case study analysis process. </strong></p><p>Assign <strong><u>one person per group</u></strong> to submit the completed document to the dropbox.

Find, select, use, and combine information from a range of sources.<br/>Understand the potential uses for information posters in social work.<br/>Communicate digitally through visuals and writing.<br/>Work together in a group to engage critically with media and images.</p><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>This assignment contains two components (1) An Info-poster designed to raise consciousness about social injustices and to bring about transformative changes in society, and (2) An Introductory document accompanying the poster. </p><p><strong>1. Info-Poster</strong></p><p> </p><p>A good digital informative poster from social work perspective will present complex human and social reality holistically, and implicitly or explicitly fulfill the four mandates of social work discipline and profession. These four mandates are social justice/social change, person-in-environment, empowerment, and problem solving. Your group will draw on the creative abilities of group members (i.e., collective) to convey your collective expressions about a particular aspect of social work and use credible sources to support the message. A good digital poster is designed with a specific central message and for a specific viewers/reader (e.g., common people, fellow social workers, other professionals, politicians, policy makers).</p><p> </p><p><strong>2. Introductory Document </strong></p><p>This Introductory Document will identify the central message contained in the poster, why this message was selected by group members, and who the targeted viewers/readers are for the poster. Describe the meaning of the graphics, words, colours and various aspects of the poster. Explain why your group chose the specific elements. This document may include the references cited on the poster.  <strong>Include the names of group members who participate in the creation of Info-Poster and contribute to the Introductory document. </strong>This should be <strong>a one-page double spaced write-up</strong> in Times New Roman, 12 font size. <strong>Introductory Document should be submitted as a Word document. </strong></p><p> </p><p><u>Info-Poster Design and Format</u><br/>Creative approaches to the format of the poster are encouraged, as long as your group fulfills the requirements described above. </p><p> <br/><u>Info-Poster Creation Tools</u><br/>There are a variety of tools available to help support the design of a poster. Use tools your group is comfortable with. You can use Microsoft Office 365 tools like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, or a tool of your groups’ choice. The assignment is intended to help your group creatively express ideas in the digital world, but the focus is NOT to develop advanced graphic or technical skills. You do not need to print or present your poster. You can include audio and video with the poster, but you are not required to.<br/> </p><p><u>A PowerPoint Slide</u><br/>A PowerPoint slide can be used to create a digital poster. You will need to create a new presentation and set up a custom size for <strong>one slide. </strong>To do this you will need to:<br/><u>PowerPoint Slide Size Setup</u><br/>Create a new blank slide in Powerpoint.<br/>From the Design tab, select Slide Size.<br/>Select the Custom Slide Size option from the dropdown menu and then setup the width and height.<br/>Click OK.</p><p><u>Citations and References </u><br/>Material obtained from other sources must be correctly cited<br/>APA Format Citation Guide <br/>Library APA Module on Citation <br/>You are encouraged to review the 15 minute training on APA Style.</p><p><br/><u>Additional Resources For Poster Creation:</u><br/>Resources for Poster Presenters l Quick Reference<br/>Introduction to Effective Poster Presentations<br/>Undergraduate Research Posters - University of Texas at Austin  (examples of good posters)<br/>Effective Poster Presentation Handout <br/>Poster Design Handout <br/>Collaborate in PowerPoint <br/>Student How To: Collaborate in Word <br/>University of Guelph: Find Audio, Images and Videos for Remixing </p><p><br/><strong>How to Submit Your Group Info-Poster and Introductory Document.</strong></p><p>There are two ways each group will submit their Info-poster and Introductory Document. Each group will select a member who will take the responsibility for submission. </p><p>1<u>. Discussion Board on LEARN</u></p><p>All groups will post the creative renderings to the Poster Viewing discussion board for the entire class to view. How other people see a social situation is important to learning about social work, (e.g., domestic violence, eating disorders). Submitted posters and the accompanying introductory write-up, will be viewed by all students. You are encouraged to reflect and comment on each other’s work using the Grading Rubric as a guide. </p><p>2. <u>Dropbox on LEARN</u></p><p>One group member will submit the final Info-Poster and Introduction document to the Info-Poster Assignment Dropbox for instructor grading. Both the poster and your introduction can be submitted to the same dropbox. In the case of multiple submissions by the same group of students, your instructor will mark only the final documents uploaded, so make sure your final documents are the correct ones. The Introductory Document must be submitted in Microsoft Word (DOC or DOCX).<br/><br/>Your group Info-poster must be submitted in one of the following file types:<br/><br/>Graphic Files.<br/>Supported file types include .JPG, .GIF, .BMP, .PNG, .TIFF, and PDF.<br/>Presentation, Audio and Video Files.<br/>Acceptable audio file formats are .MP3, .AIF, or .WAV. Acceptable video file formats are .MPEG/.MPG, or .MP4.<br/>MS Office Files.<br/>Files created in Microsoft Office applications (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Access, etc.)<br/>If your group hopes to submit a file type that is not included in the list above, please contact your instructor.<br/><br/>Note: It is strongly suggested that you limit the size of your file to 55 MB or less.</p><p><strong><u>How Your Assignment will be Graded </u></strong></p><p>All participating group members will receive the same grade. </p><p>Non-participating group members will receive a grade of 0. </p>
