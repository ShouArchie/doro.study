<p><strong>Instructor’s Comments (aka the Fine 100 Mission Statement): </strong>Think of this course as a giant art buffet. You will learn foundational aspects vis-a-vis the <i>Principles of Art</i> and <i>Elements of Design</i> (i.e. hard skills), as well as harder to pinpoint soft skills such as creativity and material knowledge, crossing media from 2D to 4D. Plus there will be lots of community building and visual culture—two things that art does really well—these will help you understand and navigate what it means to be alive today, whether that’s expressing your ideas about our troubled times and self-hood, honing your visual intelligence, or finding a place of refuge, joy, and belonging. Creativity and visual intelligence are powerful, transformative tools and I’m hoping that you leave this course inspired and wanting more art in your lives.</p>

  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>You will be able to identify and apply the Elements of Art and Principles of Design.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You will be able to summarize what visual intelligence is and apply it—from analyzing and unpacking visual imagery to constructing meaning. Check out this Ted Talk by Amy Herman to find out more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You will have opportunities to connect, collaborate, and discover. This will expose you to the communal aspects embedded within fine arts, helping you develop skills related to teamwork and community building.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You will create through studio-based practices, learning new ways of seeing and making art from 2D to 4D, becoming comfortable with experimentation, intuition and improvisation as a means toward the goal of personal expression. Within creative disciplines, this iterative and reflective approach is considered research—a valuable skill that has myriad career and life-long applications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You will be able to see yourself as part of contemporary art, learning that art is an essential aspect of our current and past histories and the ongoing development of cultural life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You will learn to develop confidence in the way you speak about artworks and at the same time develop sensitive and supportive language in considering the work of yourself and others in class discussions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You will learn by doing, acquiring knowledge vis-à-vis the senses, experience and thought. This methodology is known as cognitive learning which fosters a deeper understanding of physical materials, muscle memory, and solving problems through curiosity and hands-on creative processes.</td>

<p>Communal fees support the purchase of consumable supplies, special tools, instruments, woodshop, photography and media equipment, computer hardware and software. In an effort to reduce costs in Fine 100, we have moved towards a higher communal fee, so that we could buy things in bulk. The outcome is that you are getting to explore more media this term with a savings of about $60 from previous Fine 100 courses. Therefore, all students enrolled in Fine 100 must pay the communal fee. This ensures equal access to facilities, supplies and equipment, in class and during open studio times. </p><p>The communal fee for FINE 100 is $80.00. This fee covers printing your <i>Elements of Art</i> and <i>Principles of Design</i> cards, printing inks, newsprint, cyanotype chemicals, paper, glue, tape, drawing materials, paint, sponges, shop towels, and all cleanup supplies. This is a great deal – a huge savings in comparison to what it would cost to buy everything individually. Communal fees are paid for in the tool shed using credit or debit cards. </p><p>There is also a course kit for Fine 100 that has some basic art supplies: graphite pencils, an eraser, brush, charcoal, cardboard portfolio, paper and 2 bulldog clips. You will need this kit to complete assignments and submit them via your portfolio. You can purchase your kits directly from Fine Arts in East Campus Hall at our “Tool Crib” (ECH 1226). Payment should be made with Visa, MasterCard, AMEX and debit card – no cash, cheques or Watcard. Store hours are posted on the door to the tool crib.</p>

<h2>Course Requirements and Assessments</h2><p>There are 4 studio-based projects in this course, plus one reflective writing component. Please note that some projects have smaller deliverables that contribute to the broader themes. </p><p><strong>Project 1: Fundamental Drawing Project, Part A and B</strong></p><p>Project’s Weight: 20%   </p><p>Part A is Due Monday January 27<sup>th</sup> and Part B is Monday February 10<sup>th</sup> </p><p>This project introduces students to the Elements of Art and Principles of Design vis-à-vis a set of drawing projects that will be submitted in two parts via the cardboard portfolios from your kits. When you submit your portfolio, make sure your name is written on it. </p><p><strong>Drawing Check List for Part A  </strong></p><ul><li>Rubbings based on the <a href="https://vimeo.com/454022874?share=copy">frottage scavenger hunt</a> (password fine230)—these drawings employ observation, focusing on the sense of touch. Things to consider are mapping, texture, pattern, text as image, collage, and working at a one-to-one scale/relationship. This is a collaborative project so make sure everyone’s name is on your drawing so that you get credit for it. </li><li>Self-Portrait (drawing, wire, photograph) focuses on observation, line and studio photography.</li><li>All drawings based on positive &amp; negative space with contour. These drawings focus on observation, still life, shape, line and composition. This includes the bag/shoe drawing. </li></ul><p><strong>Drawing Check List for Part B</strong></p><ul><li>3<i> and 1 Drawing Project. </i>This project is about perception and making meaning. The 3 drawings develop from observation and the five senses. It also considers the relationship between the object, the idea, and use value of functional objects—how materiality and function are relational not only to use but also within an object-oriented ontology.  </li></ul><p><strong>Key Resources and Links</strong></p><p><i>Elements of Art and Principles of Design Cards</i>, each Fine 100 student receives these custom cards as part of their communal fee. </p><p><strong>Project 2: Paper Engineering Project </strong></p><p>Project’s Weight: 14%               </p><p>Due Date: Monday February 24<sup>th</sup>   </p><p>This project helps you move from 2D to 3D, employing techniques related to paper engineering and pop-up books/mechanics. It also helps you develop strategies related to making-meaning through generative writing exercises, as well as collage. </p><p><strong>Key Paper Engineering Resources and Links: </strong></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGJZbNh9Phs">Pop-up Tutorial 1: Materials and Basic Theory with Duncan Burmingham</a></p><p><a href="https://www.colettefu.com/">Pop-up Artist Extraordinaire #1, Collette Fu</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/gerardlomonaco/">Pop-up Artist Extraordinaire #2, Gerard Lo Monaco </a></p><p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/art-new-brunswick-museum-gallery-ann-manuel-1.6931796">Paper Engineering Extraordinaire #3, a secret installation in New Brunswick by Ann Manuel. </a> </p><p><strong>Project 3: The FINE 100 SWITCHEROO </strong></p><p>Project’s Weight: 40% (10% per instructor’s media)        </p><p>Due Date: See weekly schedule  </p><p>This project is about expanding your knowledge and experience of different media where you get to learn from a different professor (i.e., Xuan Ye the other Fine 100 instructor who will also be teaching you). There are four parts and each part is worth 10%. Note: Students should be able to complete most of the projects in-class. You get to try: </p><ol><li>Printmaking with Professor Tara Cooper</li><li>Colour and Painting with Professor Tara Cooper</li><li>Zines with Professor Xuan Ye </li><li>Clay Pipes with Professor Xuan Ye and Visiting Artist Guest </li></ol><p><strong>Project 4: Animate Your Art: A Short Film Project</strong></p><p>Project’s Weight: 10%               </p><p>Due Date: Wednesday April 2<sup>nd</sup>  </p><p>Working in groups of 3 or 4, students work in collaboration to produce a short film (1-3 minutes). You will explore live-action and stop-motion animation filming, lighting approaches, cinematography, and editing. </p><p><strong>Project 5: </strong><i><strong>Where are they now?</strong></i><strong> A One-to-Two Page Reflection on the Impact of Creativity</strong></p><p>Project’s Weight: 5%                 </p><p>Due Date: Monday February 24<sup>th</sup> </p><p><i><strong>References on the impact of visual intelligence and creativity</strong></i></p><p>Students write a 1-2 page reflection on the impact of creativity. These thoughts are based on the <a href="https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/1018091805"><i>Where are they now? Panel</i>, where UWaterloo fine arts alum</a> share their experiences post-graduation. You may also consider other resources shared throughout the course such as <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_herman_a_lesson_on_looking?language=en">Amy Herman’s Ted Talk</a>, and the two episodes on creativity from the Ten Percent Happier Podcast: <a href="https://www.happierapp.com/podcast/tph/ivy-ross-susan-magsamen">How Art Can Improve and Extend Your Life</a> and <a href="https://www.tenpercent.com/tph/podcast-episode/ingrid-fetell-lee">The Science of Joy.</a> </p><p>Here’s a few questions to consider in your writing: </p><ol><li>What did you learn from the alum talks? What did you learn from Amy Herman’s Ted Talk, and the two podcasts from Ten Percent Happier? Any tips and/or inspiration?</li><li>What was "sticky" for you? Was there anything that someone said that really resonated? Considering including a few "pull quotes". </li><li>Where do you see yourself in 5-10 years? What would you like to be doing? Does this align with anything that someone talked about? Note: It’s okay if you don’t know these answers?</li><li>Other thoughts on the <i>Where are they now? Panel</i> and creativity—was it helpful to consider creativity from a perspective beyond the individual artist working alone in their studio? We included this to support developing a lifelong creative habit, something that we believe can have a huge impact even if you don’t see yourself working as a studio-based artist, so we’re curious to know what you think. What were your takeaways?  </li></ol><p>Note: Any citations should follow University guidelines. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/citation-styles-and-guides">Here's resources from the writing and communication centre.</a> Feel free to reach out and ask questions. </p><p><strong>Participation </strong></p><p>Weight: 11% </p><p>In order to participate, you need to be present and working in the studio during class-time. There will be classes where the set-up is contingent on the facilities in East Campus Hall and it will be difficult to duplicate these at home. A lot of what happens in art is about community, and in order to build community you need to be physically present. As such I will be tracking attendance. Attendance is worth 0.5% per class for a total of 11%. Day 1 does not count, and you get one free pass to accommodate unforeseen circumstances. </p><p>Submission of Assignments:</p><p><strong>*The instructor reserves the right to refuse to grade work not seen in progress.</strong></p><ul><li>All work is submitted in-person during class or via a Dropbox on Learn. </li><li>Submit written work in Microsoft Word (.doc or .docx), or PDF formats. Links to Google docs will not be accepted. Download your Google doc as docx or PDF before submitting. </li><li>I have an Instagram account (<strong>uwaterloo_finearts_printmaking</strong>) that I started in 2020, and I sometimes post from Fine 100. Please let me know if you don’t feel comfortable participating in this public forum. It is not mandatory and you won’t be penalized if you don’t feel comfortable. Friends from other institutions along with former alum follow this, so it’s nice for me to stay connected and share work that UWaterloo students make.</li></ul><p><strong>GRADING CRITERIA</strong></p><p>Based on these categories, I will highlight your strengths (aka what to celebrate), as well as opportunities for growth when grading individual projects. Please note that I may not speak to all 4 categories…just the highs and lows (i.e. what’s working and what could be pushed or developed further). </p><p> </p><p><strong>Materials and Techniques: </strong></p><p>Does your assignment demonstrate control/aptitude over the processes and techniques?</p><p>How have you manipulated the tools to your advantage? </p><p>Is there evidence of comprehension with regards to tools, techniques and processes? </p><p> </p><p><strong>Elements of Design and Form: </strong></p><p>Does your assignment consider the Elements of Art and Principles of Design (aka your “ART CARDS”)?</p><p>Have you considered composition? How does form relate to content? </p><p> </p><p><strong>Experimentation: </strong></p><p>Does your assignment demonstrate a willingness to experiment and take risks?</p><p>Is there an aspect of innovation in terms of your approach?</p><p> </p><p><strong>Authenticity: </strong></p><p>Does your assignment reflect the personal development of an artistic voice? </p><p>Does it have a strong concept? </p><p>What kind of effort have you put in? </p><p> </p><p><strong>Late Work</strong></p><p>Late assignments will be penalized 5% per class. </p><p>Late penalties are not recoverable. In some cases, absence may be justifiable. Students are urged to consult the instructor when a medical or personal crisis has interrupted their studies.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Notes on Grading</strong></p><p>Grades are assigned according to the following parameters: </p><p>A (80-100): This grade indicates exceptional work that, to varying degrees, demonstrates a thorough understanding of the issues presented in class. The work demonstrates a deep involvement on the part of the student, and could stand on its own aesthetic terms outside of the context of a school assignment. Excellent work.</p><p>B (70-79): This grade indicates notable work that, to varying degrees, shows that the student has understood the topic and has made every effort to fulfill the requirements of the assignment to the best of his or her ability. Good work. </p><p>C (60- 69): This grade indicates, to varying degrees, satisfactory work. The work may be successful on one level, but it fails on another. Furthermore, the work may reflect a good deal of effort, but it does not adequately address the topic at hand. Acceptable work. </p><p>D (50-59): This grade indicates, to varying degrees, barely adequate work. The work displays minimal effort and commitment without a sufficient understanding of the topic at hand. Poor work. </p><p>F (33-49): This grade indicates, to varying degrees, totally insufficient or incomplete work. Failure.</p>

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details.
