<h4>COURSE DESCRIPTION </h4><p>This graduate seminar will engage with contemporary issues in art theory and practice. During our class discussions, presentations, readings and studio visits/critiques, we will unpack ideas related to current art production and their implications for your own studio practices. In this academic context we are faced with the challenge of articulating a largely visual practice in oral and written terms. This will be the major orientation of the activities of this term.  The seminar will also help you incorporate theoretical/conceptual ideas into writing and thinking about your own work.</p>

<p><strong>ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION</strong></p><p>Written assignments are submitted via email or in LEARN’s Dropbox, using Word and MLA’s format for citations. I will make comments using the track changes/review options in Word. </p><p><strong>Assignment 1: Zines Part 1 and Part 2, Weight: 20% </strong>(or 10% each)</p><p><strong>Part 1: Peer Review Zine (500-1000 words)</strong></p><p>Due date: Friday Jan. 24<sup>th</sup></p><p>Students make a zine/artist bookwork based on one of their classmate’s studio practices. Points of consideration include: the interview, setting the scene, anecdote and reflection, voice of the author and visual analysis. Please make 10 photo-copy versions of your zine/artist book so that everyone can trade. </p><p>A few writing tips from Ira Glass on how to tell a good story:  </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6ezU57J8YI">Ira on Youtube</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@the_doerco/what-you-can-learn-about-storytelling-from-ira-glass-335014cb7cdd">Anecdote/Reflection: 5 Things You Can Learn About Storytelling from Ira Glass</a></p><p><strong>Part 2: NYC Zine/Artist book (aka a travel response)</strong></p><p>Due date: Tues. Feb. 25<sup>th</sup></p><p>Students make a zine/artist bookwork based on the NYC trip. </p><p><strong>Assignment 2: Reading Animation, Weight:15%</strong></p><p>Due date: See week-by-week schedule. </p><p>Working as a team (2-3 people), students lead the class discussion by animating the provided weekly readings. The idea of how to animate is open for interpretation, but consider: </p><ol><li>Questions that prompt discussion.</li><li>Summarizing the key points.</li><li>Highlighting subjectivity (aka who are the authors what is their positionality).</li><li>An activity that illuminates the ideas and/or gets people talking.</li><li>Contextualizing the readings/resources through visual examples (i.e. relevant artists, artworks or videos that deepen and/or expand our understanding of the readings; these can be embedded within the materials I’ve provided or be references that you bring from your wheelhouse of knowledge, experience, and interests).</li></ol><p>Readings and resources are based on the following topics: </p><p>*Go to “Content” on Learn for topic descriptions and readings/resources. </p><ul><li><i>THE BODY (aka Gender, Disability Theory, Autism and Visual Thinking) </i></li><li><i>The Venice Biennale 2024 </i></li><li><i>Art of Protest </i></li><li><i>Feelings: Love, Joy, Grief and Mourning </i></li></ul><p>Note: I’ve got a “loot bag” approach to each topic, interweaving several ideas under one heading. You don’t need to address all of the provided material in your animation/class presentation, although I expect you to read/review them. As a team, you are in the driver’s seat—pick the things that resonate most (i.e. what’s sticky) and build your response/animation/summary/discussion around this. Don’t forget about pedagogy and what you’ve learned: pacing, breaking up slideshows/lectures with a question or time-based material, and/or including something hands-on. We’re all artists so if you want us to make or do something, go for it! </p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Students should expect to spend 3-5 hours on reviewing the weekly material. </p><p><strong>Assignment 3:</strong> <strong>Reading Presentation, Weight: 15%</strong></p><p>Due date: See week by week schedule.</p><p>Students prepare a 20 minute in-class presentation based on their research topics (1st years) or thesis support papers (2nd years). There are two parts to the presentation. Part I is an oral presentation supported by visuals. Part II is a class discussion based on the readings and references you provide (i.e. artists, audio clips, videos, podcasts etc.). The readings/references (Goldilocks’ length—not too long/not too short) are selected by the presenter in relation to their research topic and are distributed to the class the previous week. </p><p>Things to consider: </p><ul><li>theoretic influences</li><li>relevant contemporary art practices</li><li>conceptual underpinnings</li></ul><p>Ideally your presentation will not only clarify your research topics and thesis work, but will also lead to a lively class discussion, identifying holes and/or possibilities for development (i.e. what to edit or remove and what to add). I will facilitate the discussion of your material so you only need to worry about the presentation and supplying the readings/references. Each presentation has an allotment of 40 minutes, which includes Part I and Part II.  </p><p>Keep in mind the following academic copyright restrictions when selecting your readings and resources: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/guide-instructors">https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/guide-instructors</a> (e.g. 10% pages of a book, a single chapter or article from a publication). There will be 3 presenters so readings and resources should take 45-90 minutes to review per presenter (i.e. 30-40 pages). </p><p><strong>Assignment 4: Research Topic Essay, Weight: 35%</strong></p><p>First Year MFAs (10-15 pages), <strong>Due April 18<sup>th</sup> </strong></p><p>Students develop a research essay based on interests related to their studio practice. An outline will be due earlier in the term so that you can receive feedback prior to tackling the paper. </p><p>Preliminary outlines which will be workshopped Tues Feb. 25<sup>th</sup> should include:</p><ol><li>Short intro on the topic in written form</li><li>Thesis Statement</li><li>Proposed Sections of Paper (minimum 3)</li><li>Works Cited/References (minimum 3)</li></ol><p>Second Year MFAs, <strong>Due March 7<sup>th</sup></strong></p><p>Students submit a final draft of your thesis support essay (<strong>3,000-7,500 words</strong>).   </p><p>Thesis support documents include the following: theoretical influences, conceptual underpinnings, and relation to contemporary art practices. In order to get started/organized you may want to use these as chapter headings. </p><p><strong>Info on Thesis Support Document from the MFA Handbook: </strong></p><p>The Thesis Exhibition is accompanied by a Thesis Support Document; an illustrated, written document that is expected to be an insightful and scholarly sound explication of the visual work under scrutiny. The problems associated with the relationship between written and visual language are thoroughly understood by the faculty and expert examiners of the thesis. The Thesis Support Document is accordingly seen as the student’s perspective on the technical, historical, conceptual and theoretical aspects of the development of their work during the program. The Thesis Support Paper is supervised by the faculty responsible for the series of Graduate Seminar courses and in consultation with the student’s Committee. The faculty member responsible for the graduate seminar will provide constructive feedback relating to the grammar, sentence structure, flow, content and general editing of your written statement. Your Committee will also provide assistance in these areas. You must provide your Committee and the faculty responsible for the graduate seminar with copies of your thesis support paper at least two weeks prior to the submission deadline for your external examiner. You must also have approval from your committee members before you send the support paper to the external assessor. </p><p>Thesis Examiners expect to read evidence of an appropriate acknowledgement of the historical precedents of the candidate’s work, and an understanding of relevant theoretical issues in a document that is formally well-structured and grammatically correct with all secondary sources properly documented in footnotes and a Bibliography. These must be in accordance with the standards set out by the Graduate studies Office. Students should thoroughly familiarize themselves with UW Thesis Regulations on the GSO website at: </p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/current-students/thesis">https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/current-students/thesis</a></p><p>The Support Document has a list of required content.  How and in what order these are addressed is discussed between the student, thesis committee and seminar leader.</p><p><strong>Requited Content: </strong>Length: <strong>3,000 words minimum to 7,500 words maximum.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Abstract</strong> based on the essay that follows (functions as a preface to the text).</li><li><strong>Body of Support Document</strong></li><li>Analysis of the work in visual terms (what does it look like and why, why those materials, why those titles etc.).</li><li>Process of how the work is constructed and why.</li><li>Theoretical influences that serve as points of departure (not explanation or interpretation).</li><li>Conceptual underpinnings of the work. (What is the nature of the enquiry?)</li><li>The works relation to contemporary art practice/contemporary culture.</li><li><strong>Complete MLA style Bibliography</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Assignment 5: Mock Defence, Weight: 10%</strong></p><p>Due date: See week-by-week schedule.</p><p>Second year students will participate in a mock defence in preparation for their thesis. Each first-year student will be assigned a role (i.e. guest critic, committee member, moderator etc.). The second years will introduce and defend their work. Mock committee members will receive a draft of thesis papers and will prepare questions based on the document and the studio work. The class is conducted as a simulation where protocol and procedures mimic the real event. </p><p><strong>PARTICIPATION, Weight: 10%</strong></p><p>This mark is based on the following: preparedness during class, listening to presentations, taking an active role during class discussions, and overall engagement. Attendance is recorded regularly. </p><p><strong>LATE WORK</strong></p><p>5% will be deducted for assignments submitted one day late; 10% for two days late; 15% for three days late; etc. If you are unable to make the deadline due to unforeseen circumstances, please submit a UW Verification of Illness Form, or other official documentation if applicable.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI.</p><h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. </p><p>Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information">Quest</a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest.
