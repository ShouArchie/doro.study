Questions received during weekends will be replied to on the following Monday. When emailing your instructor, please include the following:</p><ul><li>Include your course number in the subject line, and include your full name and student number in your signature.</li><li>Clearly describe your reason for emailing and include any relevant background information that your instructor may need to help you.</li><li>Let your instructor know what you have already done, and if appropriate propose a solution. For example, if you are requesting an extension due to a family emergency, please indicate that you have reviewed the deadline and grading policies, provide documentation, and let your instructor know how and when he or she could expect to receive your assignment.</li><li>Regardless of your reason for emailing, never email your instructor at his or her personal email address unless you are given explicit permission to do so.</li></ul><h3>Email</h3><p>It is important to get into the habit of writing respectful and grammatically correct emails when corresponding with your professors, instructors, and members of staff. This is especially true of an online course where email is the primary method of communication. See the links below for helpful tips on email etiquette.</p><ul><li><a href="http://web.utk.edu/~cnattras/Etiquette.html"><u>Etiquette Tips for E-mailing Your Professors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/04/16/advice-students-so-they-dont-sound-silly-emails-essay"><u>Email Etiquette for Students (Inside Higher Ed)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/email_etiquette_for_students.html"><u>Email Etiquette for Students (Purdue Online Writing Lab)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/email_etiquette.html"><u>Email Etiquette (Purdue Online Writing Lab)</u></a></li></ul><h3>Announcements</h3><p>Your instructor uses the <strong>Announcements</strong> widget on the <strong>Course Home</strong> page in LEARN during the term to communicate new or changing information regarding due dates, instructor absence, etc., as needed.

<p>FINE 130: Introduction to Digital Imaging is a studio-based Fine Arts course taught asynchronously online. This online digital course is designed to introduce students to current digital imaging software, techniques, trends, and processes that historical and contemporary artists use to create original image based artworks. Students are encouraged to produce creative image-based projects throughout the term. FINE 130 is taught from a Fine Arts perspective.</p><p>This course gives students introductory instruction and experience in creating original artwork using digital imaging tools and software and helps students develop a visual language to discuss their own work through artist statements. While students will attain a degree of familiarity and comfort with the tools and techniques used to create digital artwork, there is a strong emphasis on content, conceptualization, and originality. This will be considered in the evaluation of student projects.</p><p>Through online lectures, tutorials and discussions, students will gain an understanding of the language used to discuss digital technologies and a critical context for the politics, power, and history of digital technologies and image making, and the impact of technologies on contemporary art practices.</p><p><i>This online course was authored and developed by Natalie Hunter, with instructional design and multimedia development support provided by the Centre for Extended Learning. Further media production was provided by Instructional Technologies and Multimedia Services.</i></p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Assignment Extensions and Late Policy</h3><p>Assignments are due by the date given in the <strong>Course Schedule </strong>in LEARN. Extensions to assignment deadlines will be granted only in case of illness or emergency. Please contact the instructor to make your request and provide credible documentation (such as a doctor’s note). Assignments submitted late without approved extensions will be subject to late penalties of 10% per week to a maximum of 50% of the assignment grade. Students may not hand in late assignments past 5 weeks. Late penalties are not recoverable.</p><p>Assignment deadline extensions will not be granted to students who were late registering to the course. Or to students who are not able to complete course assignments because they have chosen alternative software and technical training than that specified in the Course Outline.</p><p><strong>LEARN Outages:</strong> In event of service interruptions, deadlines will be adjusted in accordance with the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/service-interruptions-online-learning-environment-guidelines"><u>Service Interruption Guidelines</u></a>.</p><h3>Fine Arts Plagiarism and Copyright</h3><p>The offence of plagiarism as defined by Policy 71 (Student Discipline) includes visual and aural plagiarism of works of art (drawings, photographs, graphics, video, sound, ideas, etc. conceived/made by other artists). The rules of conduct that apply to text-based work at the University of Waterloo also apply to work completed for studio-based assignments and research. There are two issues to consider with visual and aural plagiarism: ethics, i.e. expectations related to academic integrity as outlined in Policy 71; and copyright infringement, for which you could also be legally liable. Plagiarism and copyright infringement occur when you create an artwork that is substantially similar to the original source. For example, making a drawing in pencil based on a photograph that you find in a magazine may constitute plagiarism and be an infringement of copyright.</p><h4>GenerativeAI Policy:  </h4><p>GenerativeAI (GenAI) is a technology that uses algorithms and large-language models (LLMs) to predict and /or generate texts, images, videos, sounds, music, code, and conducts tasks that are normally performed by human intelligence resembling human created content. Some examples of GenAI include <strong>but are not limited to</strong>: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Microsoft Copilot, Grammarly, for writing, DALL-E, MidJourney, Adobe Firefly (and embedded AI within Adobe suite), LeonardoAI, Bing Image creator for images, SoraAI, DeepAI for videos, SunoAI for music and sound, and many others like them.  </p><p>The technology draws from a huge repository of existing content on the internet, including your own inputs (all your social media content, including anything you upload to the internet, even personal webpage content is subject to this technology).  GenAI and related technologies are subject to existing laws and regulations in Canada, such as intellectual property, copyright and privacy laws, among others. The content generated with AI technologies are ultimately not your own, and do not necessarily belong to you. They are recycled back into the AI tech. By using GenAI you are complicit in teaching its algorithms. More information is available from Waterloo's <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>Copyright Advisory Committee</u></a>. </p><p>As with all other academic work at UW use of GenAI falls under Academic Integrity Policy 71 [including: plagiarism, unauthorized co-operation or collaboration as defined by the course instructor, unauthorized aids or assistance as defined by the course instructor, contravention of statute (e.g., <i>Copyright Act</i>), etc.]. For use of GenAI you must consult with your professor. </p><p><strong>Please take note of the following points:</strong></p><ul><li>All work submitted for evaluation must be your own. If the submitted work is determined not to be your own, the Academic Discipline Procedure of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71 - Student Discipline</u></a> will be invoked.</li><li>If you use any visual or aural material, such as images from the internet, GenAI, magazines, books, websites of other artists, or from any source that can be cited, you must acknowledge/cite those references.  Failure to do so will be deemed a violation of academic integrity and possibly an infringement of copyright and the Academic Discipline Procedure of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71 - Student Discipline</u></a> will be invoked.</li><li>If you are using visual or aural material, such as those employing Ai Tech, that you have not made yourself, <strong>you must make an appointment with your instructor/s to discuss the ramifications of using ‘found’ or ‘appropriated’ material</strong>.</li></ul><p><strong>A note on copyright free and Creative Commons:</strong></p><p>Resources are available in the public domain that are identified as copyright free or that fall under licenses from Creative Commons. Public domain is a term used for works that are not protected by copyright law. If an image is in the public domain then you are allowed to use it—to copy it, to manipulate it and to distribute it. Works identified as Creative Commons allow varying degrees of use. In this case, the authors decide how you can use their images.</p><p><strong>Helpful Links:</strong></p><ol><li><a href="http://www.carfac.ca/"><u>CARFAC</u></a> (Canadian Artists Representation / Le Front Des Artists Canadiens)</li><li><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/">Flickr</a> have databases of digital files that are available for use. However, you need to check the conditions of use as they vary</li><li>The Copyright Act in Canada was recently amended to reflect the current digital landscape. To find out more, check out <a href="http://copyright.ubc.ca/guidelines-and-resources/support-guides/bill-c-11-the-copyright-modernization-act/"><u>Bill C-11: The Copyright Modernization Act</u></a></li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/associate-vice-president-academic/artificial-intelligence-uw">Artificial Intelligence at UW</a></li></ol><h4>Generative AI and FINE 130</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills related to digital imaging. These include tools and techniques like image compositing, masking, retouching, text, painting and drawing tools, and various other tools through hands on experience with industry standard digital imaging software. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like MidJourney, Firefly, DeepAI, Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to provide your working psd files to show your work and provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p><strong>A note about AI generated art (art generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence):</strong></p><p>AI-generation apps or software are <strong>not allowed</strong> in this course. You are expected to make your own images using the tools and techniques that you learn throughout the course. Generative AI software learns by scanning and scraping the internet for image content made by others without the knowledge of the creator or their consent. This borders on copyright infringement and does a disservice to artists. Artists own the copyright to their artworks, and AI generation disrespects this right. By using AI generative software you are complicit in teaching AI algorithms and are participating in copyright infringement. In addition, the terms and conditions of most software/apps mean that when you upload any of your own images (e.g., a selfie, or your own photographs) you are also giving permission to the software/app to use that image to generate images not just for you but for anyone else who may use the same system. Your images become part of their library to generate new images. And whatever images are produced with an AI app/software can be owned by the developer. Copyright becomes a grey area and by using their software/app you are agreeing to their terms of use.</p><h3>Intellectual Property</h3><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, course author, and their peers. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides, handouts, curated video tutorials, templates, etc.);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the course author or instructor or used by the instructor with permission of the copyright owner).</li><li>Any artwork posted by students to the galleries in the course.</li><li>Any artwork made for the course by the course author, instructor, or past student examples.</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.
