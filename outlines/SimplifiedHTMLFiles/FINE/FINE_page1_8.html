<div>
<p>FINE 319: Contemporary Art is designed to introduce students to innovations in what is considered contemporary art. This period roughly encompasses art from the late 1960’s and early 1970s to today. Students will be introduced to a variety of artistic expressions, themes, and practices as they have developed in Western contemporary art practices and discourses. Through critical analysis of contemporary movements and artworks, texts, exhibitions, and films, we will be looking at the ways in which contemporary artists and critics across the globe have challenged ideas of modernity, post-modernism, and what it means to be contemporary in an uncertain age.</p><p>This course will consist of weekly lectures, film and video screenings, group discussions, as well as gallery visits. Students are expected to read assigned weekly readings, take notes, participate in discussion, and complete all assignments. Plan to spend around 3 hours of homework per week for this course. Active participation in class is expected, and attendance will be taken as it is a part of the overall participation mark. </p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Attendance Policy</h4><p>FINE 319: Contemporary Art is an in-class course. Students are expected show up to every class and participate. Attendance will be taken. Content will not be available online. Students who submit work to the Learn Dropboxes without attending classes will receive very low grades. Your instructor cannot assess your work without seeing that you are engaged with the course content. If a student misses more than 5 classes, they are in danger of failing the<br/>course.</p><h4>Late Assignments and Make-Up Tests</h4><p>Students are required to submit all assignments on time and attend all classes. Late assignments will receive a late penalty. If there is a special circumstance and a student is not able to finish their assignment on time it is absolutely necessary to talk to your instructor about it. A student who foresees conflict between a religious observation and any scheduled class assignments must notify the instructor. If you miss a test or assignment deadline for an illness a<br/>doctor’s note or Verification of Illness form MUST be presented to the instructor BEFORE your instructor can make other arrangements for you.</p><p><br/><strong>The course late policy is:</strong><br/>• 5% per day or 10% per week.<br/>• If the assignment is more than 5 weeks late, the student earns 0% on the assignment<br/> </p><h4>Electronic Device Policy</h4><p>Students are encouraged to take notes during class lectures. You are allowed to bring laptops and tablets to class for note taking, but any other activities on these devices are not allowed (eg: watching movies or playing games). The presence of laptops in a lecture hall can be distracting for some students. Please be considerate and courteous to those around you. Please do not record lectures using your phones, through video, or sound recording without the<br/>permission of the instructor. Please refrain from using your cellphones during class time. Put them on silent, or turn them off. If there is an emergency and you need your phone on during class time, speak with your instructor beforehand. </p><p> </p><h4>Contact and Communication</h4><p>Communication with your instructor is key if you are having trouble or need some help. You can reach your instructor between 9am and 5pm Monday to Friday through email at n2hunter@uwaterloo.ca. Or visit my office hours. </p><p>Your instructor checks email frequently and will make every effort to reply to your questions within 24–48 hours. Questions received during weekends will be replied to on the following Monday. When emailing your instructor, please include the following:<br/>• Include your course number in the subject line, and include your full name and student number in your signature.<br/>• Clearly describe your reason for emailing and include any relevant background information that your instructor may need to help you.<br/>• Let your instructor know what you have already done, and if appropriate propose a solution. For example, if you are requesting an extension due to a family emergency, please indicate that you have reviewed the deadline and grading policies, provide documentation, and let your instructor know how and when he or she could expect to receive you assignment.<br/>• Regardless of your reason for emailing, never email your instructor at his or her personal email address unless you are given explicit permission to do so. </p><p>In case of an emergency, and if class might be cancelled due to snowstorms or other emergency, your instructor will post an Announcement on the course home page. Make sure your Learn account subscribes to your Announcement notifications. The University of Waterloo home page will make announcements in the event the University will be closed due to dangerous weather conditions.</p><h4> </h4><h4>The Writing Centre</h4><p>The Writing Centre works across all faculties to help students clarify their ideas, develop their voices, and communicate in the style appropriate to their disciplines. Writing Centre staff offer one-on-one support in planning assignments, using and documenting research, organizing papers and reports, designing presentations and e-portfolios, and revising for clarity and coherence. You can make multiple appointments throughout the term, or drop in at the Library for quick questions or feedback. To book a 50-minute appointment and to see drop-in hours, visit www.uwaterloo.ca/writing-centre. Group appointments for team-based projects, presentations, and papers are also available. <br/> </p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4> </h4><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, in visual analysis, academic writing, critical thinking, curatorial writing, and exhibition review.  Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p><h4>Diversity Statement</h4><p>The Department of Fine Arts strongly values anti-racism, decolonization, equity, diversity, and inclusion, and considers our commitment to these values to be an essential part of our community. We are committed to creating and maintaining inclusive environments that centre the voices and experiences of equity-deserving groups, including, but not limited to Black and Indigenous individuals, people of colour, women-identifying individuals, non-binary, agender,<br/>and gender-nonconforming individuals; 2SLGBTQ+ individuals; persons with disabilities; individuals experiencing class or economic barriers; individuals experiencing houselessness; and people from other racialized, marginalized, and under-represented communities. It is our intent, and your instructor’s, that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course. We recognize the immense value of the diversity in identities, perspectives, and contributions that students bring, and the benefit it has on our educational environment.</p><h4>Pronouns and chosen or preferred first name </h4><p>Students can verify their chosen or preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>. Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc). Your legal first name will always be used on certain official documents, such as diplomas and transcripts. </p><p>Students can view and change their pronouns in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information">Quest</a>. Should you choose to include your pronouns in Quest, your pronouns will be accessible by instructors, advisors, and employees with access to Quest. If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p><p> </p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory">CAUT Guide to Acknowledging Traditional Territory</a>.</p><h4>AccessAbility Services </h4><p>AccessAbility Services, located in Needles Hall, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodation to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term and for each course. https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought.
