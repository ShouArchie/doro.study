  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>HIST 216:</div>
<p>This course contextualizes the information age around us: it examines both the technological story of the rise of the Internet, and the longer human story about the evolving concept of information, communication over time and space, and the ubiquity and complexity of the systems at the heart of our globalized world.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Internet has enabled global connection on an unprecedented level. To live and innovate in a society dominated by network communications requires understanding from where we have come. Yet, as Google executives Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen have noted,</p><blockquote><p>"the Internet is among the few things humans have built that they don't totally understand."</p><p>(Schmidt &amp; Cohen)</p></blockquote><p>While the technological story of the rise of the Internet and the Web today is important – our course touches on early computing, theories of hypertext, the ARPANET, and the networking revolutions of the 1980s and 1990s – the longer human story is equally critical. How has the concept of information evolved? How has print media emerged and evolved? How have humans communicated over time and space? How have common standards evolved, allowing people across the globe to communicate with each other?</p><p>Topics include:</p><ul><li>the invention and impact of the printing press,</li><li>nineteenth century communications technology (or why it turns out early fights around telephones can shed a lot of light on net neutrality!),</li><li>the Emergence of Hypertext from Unlikely Places,</li><li>Cold War Research Networks and the Rise of the Modern Internet,</li><li>how the 'net developed around the world, from BBSes in Taiwan to Minitel in France,</li><li>the rise of memes, Spam, and the Dark Web, and</li><li>much more!</li></ul><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Late Policies</h3><h4><strong>Individual Activities</strong></h4><p>Deadlines have been provided to help you stay on track with course work. It is very important that you do your best to keep up with submitting activities according to the dates set out on the <strong>Course Schedule</strong>. However, these deadlines are <strong>not considered "firm".</strong> Rather, they are "soft" deadlines that are designed to help you manage your time effectively. <strong>The Individual Activities Dropbox will actually remain open until the final deadline indicated on the Course Schedule</strong>. This allows you the flexibility to submit past the soft deadlines if you need to, without having to seek permission from your instructor. Bear in mind, however, that persistent, undocumented lateness in submitting your individual activities will reflect negatively on your participation grades.</p><h4><strong>Discussion Activities</strong></h4><p>Deadlines for posting and replying to discussions have been provided to facilitate meaningful discourse; i.e., to enable you to exchange ideas with your peers, construct and confirm understanding, and collaborate with each other. As such, <strong>these deadlines are considered "firm"</strong> – i.e., <strong>it is crucial that you meet the deadlines both for posting and responding as outlined in the</strong> <strong>Course Schedule</strong> These deadlines help us to avoid the scenario where everyone posts just before the deadline, and true discourse becomes impossible. Bear in mind, however, that persistent, undocumented lateness in submitting your individual activities will reflect negatively on your participation grades.</p><h4><strong>Assignments 1, 2, and 3</strong></h4><p>All assignments are expected to be submitted on time, and <strong>deadlines for these are considered "firm" as indicated on the</strong> <strong>Course Schedule</strong>. If you encounter circumstances that you feel may cause you to be late in submitting any particular assignment you should contact your instructor immediately, explain the circumstances, and we may negotiate an extension. To do so, you must be in contact with your instructor <strong>at least 48 hours prior to the deadline</strong> to request an extension. Late assignments will be accepted up to a week beyond the deadline at a penalty of 2% per day. After the fifth day, late assignments will not be accepted for any reason except those outlined in the University of Waterloo calendar (e.g., medical or family emergencies, or some other such event) and will receive a grade of 0. If an extension is granted, you are expected to submit your assignment at the agreed-upon time and date, with the appropriate documentation. Please review the Waterloo policy regarding accommodation for illness for unforeseen circumstances.</p><h2>Territorial Acknowledgement</h2><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
