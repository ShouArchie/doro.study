<div>
<div>
<div>HIST 660:</div>
<p>This course examines transnational and global historical processes, focusing on temporal and geographic scales of analysis outside of traditional national histories, and promotes linking the local and the global.  It looks at global forces influencing particular societies and encourages students to place themselves outside conventional local, regional, and national boundaries, and will critically consider a number of the metanarratives that have informed and continue to inform historiography, particularly idea such as modernity, progress, and the ongoing preoccupation with the 'rise of the west'.  Given these questions, and the almost endless scope of a course that purports to take the world as its focal point, weekly seminars will begin with a discussion of the possibilities offered by as well as the limits to transnational/global/world history, the various interpretative frameworks in use and their proponents as well as the challenges that transnational/global/world history poses.  We will then focus on particular case studies or themes so as to promote discussion that is as much historiographical as it is historical. Such themes/case studies may include:  feminism and imperialism, famine and climate change, disease and ecology, military technology and governmentally, global trade and the rise of consumer society(s), colonial knowledge and shifting ideas of race.</p>

<p>I have deliberately designed this course on the presumption that no student will have had much previous exposure to global history, but instead students will have diverse backgrounds in terms of the periods and places they have studied, and it is upon that diversity of insights, experiences, and interests that we will build. My only expectations are that students will be curious, willing to bring whatever they have learned before to the group,  open to new interpretations and perspectives, and are ready to join in the discussion. This course is a seminar, and while I welcome and encourage spirited debate (and to that end I am quite happy to play devil’s advocate), I expect that such debates will not become personalized. I recognize that our discussions will often touch upon events or themes that may be distressing or upsetting for some, and ask that everyone be respectful of each other’s space. The seminar is for everyone, and as there are no capital T truths to be learned, I hope that our discussions will be wide-ranging, informed, always thoughtful, and open-ended.</p>

<p><strong><u>AI Critique</u></strong></p><p>Pose an identical question to two different AIs (Perplexity and Copilot recommended) to have them generate lists of ten secondary sources relevant to a topic we will be studying in class. Print out/copy their answers. Write a two-page assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of each list. What classes or types of sources did the AIs privilege and which ones did they miss partially or completely?</p><p><strong><u>Conrad Reflection</u></strong></p><p>The Conrad reflection will be explained in more detail in the first class, but what I would like is a more personalized reflection on your part as to how you as a historian respond to what he is saying about global history, does he make global history clear to you, are you persuaded by his defence, and what might be some of the shortcomings of it as it pertains to your own interests and/or future research agendas? Suggested length is around 1000 words, or four pages of double spaced 12 point text.</p><p><strong><u>Book Review</u></strong></p><p>For your book review,  choose one book from the list for the weeks in which book presentations have been scheduled, and  present a summary to the class as to how that work contributes to our discussions about the how and the why of world/global/transnational history.  A five-page book review or roughly 1250 words is due the week following. Please use that as a guide, not a prescription – we all have better things to do than count words – the purpose here is to help you use space as effectively as possible and five pages is more than enough for the task at hand. . </p><p>Then ask either Perplexity or Copilot to write a 1200 word max analytical book review of the same book. Write a one-page assessment of the two results, taking care to consider what was included or excluded in both</p><p><strong><u>Major Project</u></strong></p><p>For the final project, you will design a global/transnational history lecture course aimed at first or second year students. The course can be set chronologically, thematically, or both; it can address a particular event, commodity, process, or ideology. There is plenty of scope. For this assignment, I would like to see a fully developed syllabus with a detailed breakdown of lecture topics, assigned readings, course assignments, and objectives. Feel free to use an existing first or second year course outline as a template so that you cover the relevant sections. In addition, write an essay of approximately 8 to 10 pages (2000 to 2500 words but see caveat above) wherein you explain how and why you have designed the course, the learning outcomes expected, and what a transnational/global focus has enabled you to do. You should also reflect on any limitations/constraints which arise from how you have set up and structured the course. One class has been set aside for presentations in which you can solicit input before putting the final touches to your project. Earlier in the term I will be scheduling individual sessions with each of to discuss your ideas and ensure that you are on the right track with the course design.</p><p><strong><u>Participation</u></strong></p><p>Participation will be assessed according to familiarity with the materials and issues under discussion, the degree of leadership demonstrated, respectful interaction and engagement, and support and encouragement for fellow classmates. I will provide you with comments relating to this mark at midterm.</p>

<h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory">CAUT Guide to Acknowledging Traditional Territory</a>.</p><p> </p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><p> </p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will be discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions.</p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas.

Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details.
