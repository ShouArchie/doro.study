<p>To study legal history and aspects of the legal system in Canada, our course takes a thematic and social history approach so that we can focus on the ways that individuals and communities have interacted with and shaped the law. We will also discuss how the law has been transformed through the activism of people, how the legal system has prioritized some groups over others, the relationship between law and colonialism, and the regulation of gender, sexuality, and race. The course examines the impact of historical events on the legal system in Canada law, including Indigenous, immigration, criminal, and environmental law and it will offer an overview of major shifts in the Canadian legal system.</p>

<p><strong>Course Format</strong></p><p>Please join our weekly classes prepared to discuss with your colleagues assigned readings and/or media that is posted on LEARN. You are expected to attend classes including guest speaker presentations, read the required texts, and participate actively in class activities and discussion groups. Engaging in group discussions, listening attentively, and speaking persuasively and respectfully to others are learned skills and we will work to provide opportunities and a collaborative space for everyone to build their skills for both listening and speaking.</p><p>Please review the weekly materials posted in the syllabus and on LEARN as "<strong>Readings and Media</strong>" for Monday’s class. Our Monday lectures are designed to provide students a coherent view of the major events, themes, and processes that have shaped legal histories. While we pay careful attention to chronology, lectures may not always follow a chronological order but will provide an overview of key themes and case study examples. We will also re-examine this history with a theoretical and thematic lens throughout the term. Materials posted on LEARN under the heading "<strong>Sources for Class</strong>" (i.e., short videos, primary source documents), will be reviewed as in-class activities, but feel free to review them in advance if you are able. Materials posted as "<strong>Recommended Resources</strong>" are not required, but provide other resources that you may wish to review for your papers or interest. </p><p>Students may use laptops or tablets to take notes or locate relevant material online. Please put phones on silent and do not text or engage with social media during class (unless an emergency of course).</p><p>We will post any schedule changes on LEARN using the announcements and calendar. If you are ever unclear or confused or have questions about course content or our expectations – reach out! We are here to help you navigate your learning and to work with you together. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignments </strong></p><p>Detailed assignment sheets will be posted to LEARN and we will discuss these assignments in class. Please note that all deadlines are on Fridays and you can post your assignments to the LEARN dropbox (the dropbox will not close at 11:59pm). </p><p><u>Three term essays</u></p><p>There are three short essays(4-5 pages) due throughout the term. You will choose a week's theme, develop a research question, and present an analysis of the major themes or debates, drawing from the course resources (lectures, guest speakers, readings, media, and primary source materials). If you would like to develop an alternative format to relay your ideas (i.e., a more journalistic or op-ed writing, for example), please speak with the instructors for approval. </p><p><u>Final take-home exam</u></p><p>During the final week of class, we will identify major themes and develop a series of questions based on the course content. Students will have the opportunity to discuss these questions in groups and present their ideas to the class (this will be marked as completed). These questions will form the basis of the take-home exam that will be due during the exam period. </p><p><u>General comments re. assignments</u></p><p>Please submit all written work to the appropriate drop box on LEARN. All assignments should be double spaced and 12pt. font. In History, we use Chicago citation formats, but feel free to use the format in your prospective academic discipline, just be sure to use it consistently. During term, we hope to hold some writing workshops where you can learn about academic writing, including formatting citations, how to use quotes effectively, use of active and passive voice etc. Also feel free to take advantage of the university’s Writing Centre and Communication Centre (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/">https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/) </a>and our History Liaison Librarian Farzaneh Karamati (fkeramati@uwaterloo.ca). </p><p> </p><p><strong>Late Policy and Extensions</strong></p><p>Every student has an automatic seven (7) days of extension on all term work. You may use them all at once or spread them out over the three written assignments. If you are running into difficulties with a paper or require extra time, please speak with us before the due date.</p><p>Students who would like to attempt to improve a grade on an essay are encouraged to meet with me and submit a revised paper within a week of receiving their marked assignment. I am also happy to review drafts ahead of the due date and offer feedback. </p><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as <strong>[fill this in with your discipline-specific skills]</strong>. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes.
