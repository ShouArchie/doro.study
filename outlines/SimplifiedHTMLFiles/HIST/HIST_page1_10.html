<p>This course will lead you to a deeper understanding of the history of Christianity along two paths. First, we will trace the immense scope of this religion’s expansion from unlikely beginnings to emergence as a global religion. We will pay particular attention to cross-cultural interactions and developments outside of the Global North. Second, through critical analysis of source evidence, we will measure the influence of larger developments on the experience of local communities and individual lives. This course will provide an introduction to the diversity of Christian beliefs and practices. It will also address how Christians have related to one another and to their societies. In addition to examining convictions, we will explore the great variety of Christian ways of life and forms of political, social, and cultural expression through a historical lens.</p><p>While introducing you to important contexts, events, and people in the history of Christianity, this course invites you to engage in the techniques of historical research and interpretation yourselves. As historians in training, you will learn how to better discern the significance of primary sources, evaluate the arguments of other scholars, and present original conclusions about the past and its connection to the present. History requires you to think critically, use information effectively, understand and value difference, and communicate well-informed arguments. This course will help you develop skills that you will continue to use in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Content quizzes:</strong></p><p>Three quizzes (30 min.) on course content, assessed in class on Jan. 28, Feb. 25, and Apr. 1.</p><p><strong>Source analysis group work</strong></p><p>History is not what happened, but rather an act of interpretation in the present to find meaning in this past. Good historical interpretation results from the exercise of specific skills refined through practice; it’s a process that works best in a collective. Throughout the term, you and a small group of your peers will participate in source analysis and historical skill-building exercises in class and submit your notes. This is not a formal writing assignment, but rather a way of condensing, organizing, and presenting the content of your thinking. To assist you, I’ll provide guidance and forms to structure this practice. Although you’ll be evaluated individually, I’ll be looking for evidence of consistent collaboration. Since this activity will take place during in-class sessions, it will also allow me to track attendance and engagement. At the end of the term, you will submit a short evaluation of your contributions and learnings and the activity of your peers. </p><p><strong>750-word primary source analysis: "It's biased." "Yeah, and...?" </strong></p><p>Primary sources are traces (texts, images, materials) that have survived from the period we're studying. They were shaped by human intention(s) and are, thus, biased in the sense that they reflect those intentions. In this analysis, you will first identify which contexts, values, and interests shaped the creation of the source and its content. This work is an important but merely <i>preliminary </i>task. Discerning what the source can tells us requires more of us. In the second and more substantive section of your analysis, you will analyze the author's argument, interpret the source's historical meaning, and/or assess its value as evidence for a particular question about the past. </p><p>You may select the primary source you wish to analyze from those assigned in the course schedule. You'll need to submit it by 11:59 p.m. the day before the reading is discussed in class.  </p><p><strong>750-word secondary source analysis: "More of a comment than a question."</strong></p><p>To critique scholarship--that is, to evaluate how a historian gathers, analyzes, and the interprets the meaning of evidence--is a vital knowledge-building practice. At the same time, the search for holes in argumentation can foreclose our ability to learn from and engage constructively with others' research. In this analysis, you will employ the THOMAS secondary source analysis tool to think <i>with </i>the scholars whose work you've been assigned. The task is to come up with a thoughtful, sustained comment on the reading that connects it to other scholarly work or broader course topics, rather than simply pointing out where it falls short. </p><p>You may select the secondary source you wish to analyze from those assigned in the course schedule. You'll need to submit it by 11:59 p.m. the day before the reading is discussed in class.  </p><p><strong>Proposal/Annotated Bibliography</strong></p><p><u>Mar. 2</u></p><p>This is a preparatory step for your final assignment (see description below). In your one-page proposal, you should address the following questions:</p><ul><li>What is the topic of your analysis?</li><li>What is your guiding research question?</li><li>What type(s) of evidence will you draw on?</li><li>What will we learn as the result of the proposed project? Why is it worth knowing?</li></ul><p>In your two-page annotated bibliography, you will present the content of five secondary sources that will allow you to place your object of analysis in historical perspective and link it to broader phenomena in Christian belief and/or practice.</p><p>As part of the development of your final projects, you will also be expected to evaluate the proposals of two peers.</p><p><strong>Final: Local Christianities in Historical Perspective</strong></p><p><u>Apr. 13</u></p><p>In this course, we ground study of the centuries-long, global development of Christianity in examination of the experiences of particular communities and individuals. In this summative assignment, you will do the same by analyzing <i><strong>one</strong></i> current, local manifestation of Christian ways of life or forms of political, social, and cultural expression through a historical lens. This will require you to (1) observe and describe a local Christian ceremony, action, material object (e.g. place of worship, musical instrument, sign, etc.), or artwork; (2) flesh out a historical context for what you’ve observed; and (3) link the particular element of local Christian life you’ve chosen to broader phenomena in Christianity. Your final submission—a six-page, double-spaced written analysis—should address these three objectives in roughly equal proportion. You have freedom to select your topic, but ideas require my approval through a conversation about your proposal and annotated bibliography. </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website</a> </p><h4>Style and Submission Guidelines and Policy on Late Work</h4><p>All written assignments should be double-spaced and use 12-point font and one-inch margins. When direct citations to sources are necessary, please use footnotes in accordance with The Chicago Manual of Style, 17th edition. Consult the Chicago Style Citation Quick Guide at http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html. Further information and links to sample citations are available here: https://lib.uwaterloo.ca/web/online-reference-shelf?toc_id=14.<br/><br/>Proper spelling and grammar and the clarity of your writing—in short, evidence of careful editing and proofreading—influence the reader’s ability to understand your ideas, and may impact your grade.</p><p>All individual writing assignments must be uploaded as Microsoft Word documents to appropriate submission folders under the “Assignments” tab on the course LEARN page by 11:59 p.m. on the due date. Please save your assignment submission receipts (that arrive via email) until the assignment has been returned to you. This will help us clear up any confusion about whether an assignment is submitted on time or not. If you do not receive a receipt, this means that your assignment was likely not accepted by LEARN. You will need to resubmit it. <br/><br/>Submission deadlines are firm, but I will make accommodations in the case of necessity at my discretion. If you anticipate difficulties in submitting your work by a deadline, please be in touch with me as soon as you can.<br/><br/>University policy regarding grades and grading systems is available <a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Grades">here</a>.</p><h4>Attendance Policy</h4><p>Attendance is evaluated through your presence at and engagement in in-person class meetings and informs your source analysis group work grade.</p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills in the discipline of history. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Declaring Absences</h4><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness or extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness Form</a> (VIF) that is completed and signed by a healthcare practitioner. The VIF indicates the determination by a care provider of the degree of incapacitation for a given period. The VIF should then be submitted by the student to the must be uploaded and submitted through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other"><u>Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</u></a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once approved, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  </p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
