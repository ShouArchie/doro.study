<p>The West as an idea stands at the centre of many of the fiercest debates in our public life. At stake in these discussions about the nature of the West and its history are answers to basic questions about our common life: Who are we? Where have we come from? Who do we include in or exclude from our stories? What role does history play in shaping our shared objectives?</p><p>This course approaches these questions historically, teaching methods of historical thinking and writing through the study of the events and ideas that make up the history of the West from 1600-present. Together, we will approach the West as a concept worthy of investigation in its own right—not a fact, but a set of historical arguments made by people to achieve a variety of purposes. While tracing the emergence and development of political, social, and cultural institutions, practices, and ideas associated with the West during the past centuries, we will pay particular attention to the ways in which the history of the West has become world history. We will also examine how understandings of the West have shifted over time, and the role they play in public life today. </p><p>While introducing you to important contexts, events, and people in the history of the West, this course invites you to engage in the techniques of historical research and interpretation yourselves. As historians in training, you will learn how to better discern the significance of primary sources, evaluate the arguments of other scholars, and present original conclusions about the past. History requires you to think critically, use information effectively, understand and value difference, and communicate well-informed arguments. This course will help you develop skills that you will continue to use in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Content Quizzes:</strong></p><p>Three quizzes (30 min.) on course content, assessed on Jan. 30, Feb. 27, and Mar. 27.</p><p><strong>Source Analysis Group Work:</strong></p><p>History is not what happened, but rather an act of interpretation in the present to find meaning in this past. Good historical interpretation results from the exercise of specific skills refined through practice; it’s a process that works best in a collective. Throughout the term, you and a small group of your peers will participate in source analysis and historical skill-building exercises in class and submit your notes. This is not a formal writing assignment, but rather a way of condensing, organizing, and presenting the results of your conversation. To assist you, I’ll provide guidance and forms to structure this practice. Although you’ll be evaluated individually, I’ll be looking for evidence of consistent collaboration. Since this activity will take place during in-class sessions, it will also allow me to track attendance and engagement. At the end of the term, you will submit a short evaluation of your contributions and learnings and the activity of your peers. </p><p><strong>Sources of Slavery Analysis (750 words): </strong></p><p><u>Feb. 7</u></p><p>Historical knowledge is grounded in primary source evidence. This evidence reflects the values and interests of its creators and the contexts in which it was produced. For these reasons, sources can obscure as much as they reveal. This assignment requires you to explore these dynamics by placing two texts into conversation with one another: (1) a narrative authored by an enslaved African women in the Americas and (2) an excerpt from Jennifer Morgan's <i>Reckoning with Slavery: Gender, Kinship, and Capitalism in the Early Black Atlantic. </i>Your analysis should respond to the following questions:</p><ul><li>What do different types of sources reveal or obscure about the experience of enslaved people?</li><li>Whose interests, values, and contexts shape the evidence available to us today?</li><li>What interpretive challenges or opportunities do different types of sources present?</li></ul><p><strong>Historical Film Review: </strong></p><p><u>Mar. 20</u></p><p>Our historical imagination is shaped by visual representations of the period we study. This is particularly true of our understandings of modern conflict in the west. In order to assess these portrayals, you will write a 750-word review of Peter Jackson’s <i>They Shall Not Grow Old </i>(2018), Gillo Pontecorvo’s<i> Battle of Algiers</i> (1966), or Icíar Bollarín’s <i>Even the Rain</i> (2010). You may decide how you choose to structure your response, but limit plot summary and privilege critical analysis. You may decide to address some of the following questions:</p><ul><li>How does the filmmaker portray the subject of their film?</li><li>Does the filmmaker seem concerned with historical “accuracy”? Why or why not?</li><li>How does this film contribute to or detract from our understanding of its subject?</li><li>Who is the audience for this film?</li><li>What special constraints is the filmmaker working under?</li><li>What kind of history does this film constitute?</li></ul><p>To assist you in your critical assessment of the film, you must make reference to at least one scholarly work that addresses issues of method and/or theory associated with the representation of history in film. </p><p><strong>Final Essay/Unessay: </strong></p><p><u>Apr. 13</u></p><p>In Zora Neale Hurston’s words, “Research is formalized curiosity; it is poking and prying with a purpose.” In the discipline of history, scholars produce knowledge about the past through examination of primary source evidence and engagement with the findings of other scholars (usually in the form of scholarly articles and books). This final assignment allows you to put the historical practices you have developed over the course of the semester to work in a piece of original historical interpretation. This project requires you to analyze at least <i><strong>five</strong></i><strong> </strong>primary sources from class to support an argument about the history of the West. You must also use at least one secondary source from outside of class readings and compare your findings to those of the author. You may present your conclusions in the form of a 5-7 page essay <i>or</i> as an unessay, a free format that allows you to make a historical argument outside the creative bounds of a traditional essay. You select the topic, choose a mode of presentation, and submit your work for feedback and evaluation. My hope is that this flexibility will allow you to play to your strengths and, thereby, to model the variety through which historical knowledge can be communicated. Unessay ideas require my approval. </p>

<h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>.</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website</a> </p><h4>Style and Submission Guidelines and Policy on Late Work</h4><p>All written assignments should be double-spaced and use 12-point font and one-inch margins. When direct citations to sources are necessary, please use footnotes in accordance with The Chicago Manual of Style, 17th edition. Consult the Chicago Style Citation Quick Guide at http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html. Further information and links to sample citations are available here: https://lib.uwaterloo.ca/web/online-reference-shelf?toc_id=14.<br/><br/>Proper spelling and grammar and the clarity of your writing—in short, evidence of careful editing and proofreading—influence the reader’s ability to understand your ideas, and may impact your grade.</p><p>All individual writing assignments must be uploaded as Microsoft Word documents to appropriate submission folders under the “Assignments” tab on the course LEARN page by 11:59 p.m. on the due date. Please save your assignment submission receipts (that arrive via email) until the assignment has been returned to you. This will help us clear up any confusion about whether an assignment is submitted on time or not. If you do not receive a receipt, this means that your assignment was likely not accepted by LEARN. You will need to resubmit it. </p><p>Submission deadlines are firm, but I will make accommodations in the case of necessity at my discretion. If you anticipate difficulties in submitting your work by a deadline, please be in touch with me as soon as you can.</p><p>University policy regarding grades and grading systems is available <a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Grades">here</a>.</p><h4>Attendance Policy</h4><p>Attendance is evaluated through your presence at and engagement in in-person class meetings and informs your source analysis group work grade.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills and habits of thought in the discipline of history. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Declaring Absences</h4><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness or extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness Form</a> (VIF) that is completed and signed by a healthcare practitioner. The VIF indicates the determination by a care provider of the degree of incapacitation for a given period. The VIF should then be submitted by the student to the must be uploaded and submitted through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other"><u>Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</u></a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once approved, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  </p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  </p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period.

Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.

Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
