<p>The NE 455L-C (Nanobiosystems Laboratory 2) course involves three lab periods, each of five hours in duration. This lab involves a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplify a region of DNA and characterize it by gel electrophoresis. Protein expression by growing E. Coli as the expression host. Protein which is produced during the first section will be purified using techniques such as metal affinity columns. The purity of the protein will be examined by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. During the third section nano-gold particles (AuNP) will be made and characterized and the protein will be assembled on the AuNP. The assembly of the protein on the AuNP will be studied by fluorescent spectroscopy.</p>

<p>Pre-lab Report</p><p>Prior to each laboratory period, a pre-lab report must be completed. The prelab report MUST be handwritten. It is designed to be essential to the understanding of the procedures and final report write up. The pre-lab report should be uploaded to LEARN Dropbox prior to the start of the laboratory. In addition, the students should bring the original pre-lab report and a hard copy of it to the laboratory; The original copy of the pre-lab report should be handed-in to the instructor in the beginning of the laboratory period for marking and the hard copy of it should be used by the student during the laboratory period. </p><p>In-lab Performance  </p><p>Pre-laboratory presentations occur at the beginning of each laboratory session given by the Lab Instructor. Late arrival for any laboratory session will result in a performance grade deduction (25% deduction for every 5 min) for that session; students who arrive for a laboratory session following completion of the introductory presentation will not be allowed to participate in that session, and will receive a zero grade for it.</p><p>Although most laboratory exercises are performed in groups, marks are allocated in each laboratory session for in-laboratory performance and laboratory notebook record keeping. Activities such as horse-play, dangerous practices with the lab equipment, not adhering to safety protocol, and/or lack of participation during a laboratory session will result in grade deductions and may even result in expulsion from that session.</p><p>Students are expected to participate in laboratory sessions in a safe manner at all times, thereby ensuring not only their own personal safety, but also that of their classmates and the Teaching Assistants. WHMIS 2015 and undergraduate laboratory<br/>safety training must be completed in order to participate in laboratory sessions. Non-compliance will result in a student being removed from the laboratory until proper training has been satisfactorily completed. Safety quizzes that stress the particular hazards for each laboratory experiment or exercise must also be completed in order to participate in specific laboratory sessions. The grade obtained on the safety quiz will be reflected on the in-lab performance mark. A grade of &gt;85% on the safety quiz means no marks will be deducted. A mark of 70-85% will mean 1 mark deducted, 60-70% will mean 2 marks deducted and &lt;60% will result is a student being removed from the laboratory</p><p>Report Deadlines</p><p>Final reports are due by midnight four days following the relevant laboratory session and should be submitted to LEARN DROPBOX. Any late for report submission after the due date will receive a deduction of 20 % per day.</p><p>** Note that the last submission on LEARN is the one which is going to be marked.</p><p> </p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>Students are expected to attend all laboratory sessions in their assigned section and time. Each week builds on the previous week’s work, and it is difficult to reschedule laboratory sessions. Students need to reach out to their instructor as soon as they know they will miss a lab.</p><p>If a student is too sick to attend a lab, they must complete a VIF, and also reach out to the instructor to request a make-up date. Students who know they will need to miss a lab due to a foreseeable issue (familial, religious, etc), are to contact the instructor 2 weeks before the missed lab so that a make-up lab slot can be found.</p><p>Students who submit a short-term absence that results in missing a lab will need to reach out to the instructor to request a make-up date. Note that certain laboratories have very few makeup labs slots available, depending upon the instrumentation or activity. It is possible that a make-up date cannot be found especially later in the term. In very rare cases the student may be exempt from that lab experiment and the marks are reallocated to the other lab experiments.</p><p>Students are required to complete all three experiments in this course. The student must attend the in-person hands-on portion of the laboratory exercise for it to be completed. If any labs are missed, the student will receive an INC for the course, where the hands-on experiments will be completed during the next offering of the course with a similar laboratory exercise. </p><p> </p>
