The course outline presents the instructor’s intentions for course assessments, their weights, and due dates in Winter 2025. As best as possible, we will keep to the specified assessments, weights, and dates. To provide contingency for unforeseen circumstances, the instructor reserves the right to modify course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines with due and fair notice to students. In the event of such challenges, the instructor will work with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty. </p><p><strong><u>Important Dates for the Term:</u></strong></p><p>Here are some IMPORTANT DATES to be aware of throughout the term:</p><ul><li>Jan 6: Classes begin</li><li>Jan 17: Last day to add a class</li><li>Jan 24: Tuition and fee refund deadline - 100% | Last Day to Drop Class from Academic Record</li><li>Jan 25: Drop with WD begins</li><li>Jan 31: Final examination schedules released</li><li>Feb 14: Tuition and fee refund deadline - 50%</li><li>Feb 15-23: Reading Week (No Classes | Family Day Holiday on Feb 17)</li><li>Mar 1: Application to graduate due (for 4th year students)</li><li>Mar 21: Drop with WD ends</li><li>Mar 22: Drop with WF begins</li><li>Apr 4: Last day of classes</li><li>Apr 8: Drop with WF ends</li><li>Apr 9: Final examination period begins</li><li>Apr 25: Final examination period ends (note emergency day on Apr 13+26, Good Friday holiday on Apr 18 [no exams])</li><li>Apr 26: Grades begin to appear on Quest (not all grades will be available on this date)</li><li>May 20: Standing decisions and official grades available in Quest</li></ul><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Inclusivity Statement</h4><p>Every student in NE 131 is expected to treat their peers and their instructor with kindness, fairness, acceptance, and respect. In turn, your instructor will treat you the same. This extends to welcoming the opinions of others and being considerate of their lived experiences.  A more welcoming and inclusive environment is created when we refrain from discussing a person’s appearance or making assumptions based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or other personal characteristics. </p><p>If you have a concern about how you or someone else is being treated, some of the people you can contact at the University of Waterloo include your instructor, <a href="mailto:psimovic@uwaterloo.ca">Fil Simovic</a>; the Associate Dean of Science for Teaching and Learning, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/chemistry/profile/ldeakin">Laura Deakin</a>; the University of Waterloo’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/conflict-management-human-rights/cmahro-resources/documenting-complaint-harassment">Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Office</a>; and the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/conflict-management-human-rights/cmahro-resources/documenting-complaint-harassment">Conflict Management &amp; Human Rights Office</a>. </p><p>If you experience or witness sexual assault or domestic violence, contact the Waterloo Region Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence Treatment Centre. A specialized team is located 24/7 at the Emergency Department of St. Mary’s General Hospital or call (519) 749-6994. If you are in immediate danger or crisis at anytime, please call 911.</p><p>If you would like to submit an inquiry or disclose an experience of discrimination based the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/page-1.html">Canadian Human Rights Act</a>, you can do so here: <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a></p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Recommendations for how to cite GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
