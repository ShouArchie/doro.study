<p>This course is designed to help students better understand the negative impacts of exposure chemicals or nanomaterials. This course covers the fundamentals of toxicology, exposure assessment, epidemiology and risk assessment. Students will develop a general understanding of how to predict how chemicals travel in the environment, and what health impacts could be expected for animals and humans. Students will better understand how to interpret results from human observational studies suggesting the association of a chemical with a particular health effect. Students will assemble these ideas and examine the role of nanotechnology in sustainable development. </p>

<p><strong>Tests and Final exam:</strong></p><p>Tests and final exams will be long/short answer, written in-person. </p><p>Any absence from a test will result in the transfer of the weight of the quiz to the final exam. Make-up tests will not be available. <u>Students do not need to submit a VIF for a missed test</u> ; All students have the option to transfer the weight of the quizzes to the final if that results in a better grade. The final exam will be cumulative. </p><p><u>Absence from the final exam requires the submission of a VIF form, and students are to reach out to the instructor to explain their absence. </u>Any foreseeable absence from the final, including religious holidays, must be disclosed to the instructor at least 2 weeks before the final exam. With a VIF, <u>the student will have access to the makeup final exam.</u> Students need to write to the instructor within 48 hours of submitting the VIF for the final exam. Students are to reach out for the date of the make-up final exam. If a date cannot be set before the end of term, the student will receive an INC for the course, and an INC agreement will indicate when the final exam will be cleared.</p><p><strong>Save the World Pitch:</strong></p><p>Students will be placed into groups and will prepare a slide and ~3min pitch. Topics, groups and marking rubric will be provided one week beforehand. Students will have time in class to work on their topics and seek help. Judges from UW Sustainability Office and Office of the Dean of Engineering will evaluate pitches, and Top 3 will be sent to the Sustainability Office and the Dean's office for inclusion into Faculty and University Social Media sites (with student permission).</p><p>Students will outline what each group member's responsibility, will evaluate contributions of all to the pitch, and will ask questions to other groups after their presentation. The grading rubric will be provided two weeks before the pitch, as well as the members of the groups. Students who are absent on the day of group work or of the presentation, and who present a VIF or other self-declared absence, will need to present either the pitch or explain their slide to the instructor, at the earliest time upon their return to campus.</p><p><strong>Assignments:</strong></p><p>Students with a requested absence, Verification of Illness form, self-declaration Covid illness or short-term absences that coincide with the due dates for assignments or reviews will need to immediately contact the instructor and an extension will be considered. </p><p>Late assignment submissions will be subject to 10% grade loss on that assessment per hour block or portion of 12 hours. Students will be submitting assignments to both a LEARN dropbox, and to PeerScholar, where student will be reviewing the submissions of others. The time of submission will be the later of the two LEARN and PEAR submissions. Turnitin will be enabled for all assignment submissions for originality screening. Assignment information, including the rubric used to evaluate the work of others as well as well as the rubric used by the instructor to mark the reviews, and the details of the assignment topics, will be provided 2 weeks before the due date.</p><p><strong>Some Assignments may be individual or group work:</strong></p><p><u>Understand individual work.</u> While students can discuss their work with the instructor as well as with other students, they are to submit work that is distinctly their own. Turnitin will be used to screen for originality. Submissions with a high degree of similarity will be brought to the Associate Dean for resolution.</p><p><strong>Know how to paraphrase work into your own words - A plagiarism offence can place you on disciplinary probation:</strong></p><p>Students are required to understand what constitutes plagiarism, and how to paraphrase scientific writing.</p><p>**<i>Adding a word or a comma does not make a sentence yours if the specifics or meaning has not changed</i>.</p><p>Hint: take point form notes, then later make your own sentences</p><p><strong>Know how to reference your sources - only use in-text citations: </strong></p><p><i><strong>How do you place an intext citation into the text of your assignment?</strong></i></p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>If you are paraphrasing an idea from another work, you only have to make reference to the author and year of publication in your in-text reference, and then add the full information in your <u>References</u> list at the end of your paper.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> in your text where you are discussing citations, you might state: </p><p><i>According to Deakin et al. (2022), APA style is an easy citation format for first-time learners. </i></p><p>Or you could write this as:</p><p><i>APA style is an easy citation format for first-time learners. (Deakin et al., 2022)</i></p><p>(et al. means there are other authors listed in the full reference)</p><p><i><strong>What do you put in a References section?</strong></i></p><p>In your References (in alphabetical order) you would list all of the references used in the document. </p><p>You can consult an APA guide or follow this format:</p><p>Author’s last name, Author’s first initial. Alphabetical list of all authors. (Year of publication). <i>Title of work</i>. Publisher or website accessed (date of access). </p><p>References example (you would listed all in alphabetical order):</p><p>Deakin, L.; Other, N. (2022) <i>Learning to Cite</i>. www.learningtocite.ca (Accessed Jan 1, 2023)</p><p><i><strong>Do you include other general sources that are <u>not specifically linked to a citation in the text</u>?</strong></i></p><p>NO.</p><p><strong>Do you have questions?

<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
