<p>The objective of the course is to impart knowledge needed to evaluate a proposed biosensing technology. In this course, an introduction to the field of biosensors and an in-depth and quantitative view of device design and performance analysis will be given. Students will be introduced to different biosensing techniques, such as electrical biosensors and electrochemical biosensors with an emphasis on biomedical and environmental applications. Students will also learn about the continuous and real-time biosensors, such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices. Student will be familiarized with some of the conventional techniques used in the clinic for disease diagnosis such as ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and then with the current state-of-the-art technologies and lab-on-a-chip devices and biosensors developed to simplify and improve molecular and cellular diagnostic approaches. Students will learn about microfluidic systems which have been developed rapidly in recent years and emerge as a powerful tool in the field of biomedical engineering. During this course, we will discuss microfluidic device fabrication focusing on device design and cleanroom fabrication (soft lithography, hot embossing, micro-milling) and testing. During first two weeks of the course, students will be briefly introduced to the basic molecular biology, such as DNA, RNA and protein and their role in biosensor. Additional background reading is supplied providing information on basic concepts in chemistry, thermodynamics and cell biology.</p>

<ul><li>Introduction to molecular biology <ul><li>For this topic, students will be given a brief introduction on the structures of DNA, RNA, and protein as they are target and probes of biosensors. Students will be briefly familiarized with transcription and translation process and the function of different types proteins.</li></ul></li><li>Biosensor elements <ul><li>For this topic, students will be taught about common elements of a biosensor, including bio-receptor (enzyme/antibody/cell/nucleic acid/aptamer), transducer component (semi-conducting material/nanomaterial), and electronic system which includes a signal amplifier, processor, and display.</li></ul></li><li>Calibration curves, the method of standard addition, and sensitivity <ul><li>For this topic, students will learn how to evaluate a biosensor based on its sensitivity and specificity. They will learn about common methods of deriving the calibration curve and determining the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification of biosensors (LOQ).</li></ul></li><li>Electrochemical biosensors <ul><li>Electrochemical biosensors are a class of electrical sensors and usually consist of three main electrodes: working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode. For this topic, students will be familiarized with the electrochemical biosensor concept while some novel methods, such as incorporating nanostructure to increase their sensitivity, will be presented.</li></ul></li><li>Enzyme-based biosensors, e.g., the blood glucose sensor <ul><li>Enzyme-based biosensors uses enzymes as the recognition elements and combines it with a transducer to produce a signal which is proportional to target analyte concentration. Students will learn about this class of biosensor, specifically via introduction of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices as a well-known enzyme-based sensor. In this topic, students will be also introduced to the recent progress in the field of real-time monitoring.</li></ul></li><li>Microfluidic biosensors and devices<ul><li>Students will learn about microfluidic device fabrication and characterization and will be also introduced to COMSOL for simulating microfluidic devices.</li></ul></li></ul><p> </p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as writing. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
