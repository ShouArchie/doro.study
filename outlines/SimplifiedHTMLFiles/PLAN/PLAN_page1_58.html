  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>GEOG 487 / PLAN 487:</div>
<p>Built around a set of key issues in the management of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Focuses on middle management concerns and covers topics including GIS needs assessment, benchmarking, the law and spatial data, spatial data warehousing, multi-user GIS modelling, and GIS application development. Uses of GIS in both public and private sector organizations are covered.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:   Successful completion of Geog/Plan 381 or Geog/Plan 387.</p><p><strong>Recommended</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding the prerequisites listed above, <strong>it is highly recommended that students complete both Geog/Plan 381 and 387 before taking this course</strong>.  If you have not completed both courses, you will be expected to have a strong knowledge of spatial analysis and spatial database management. </p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>An important aspect of the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) industry, which can be overlooked in university education, concerns practical aspects of the management of this technology in the workplace. In this course, the term “management” encompasses technology, the broader geospatial industry, and their interfaces between society and organisations.  Some topics that fall within this definition include: assessing user needs, current and emerging technologies, legal aspects of spatial data use, end user education and staffing, and the changing socio-technological contexts in which GIS are situated.</p><p>This course provides an overview of these and some other aspects of GIS management.  The course is built around a sequence of seminar topics, some of which involve a presentation from a guest speaker, who is expert on the topic they speak to. The course seeks to introduce students to issues that affect how spatial information technologies are implemented and managed within the workplace as well as how the evolution of these technologies affects their use in organizations and more generally across society. GIS management issues are essentially the same in the public and private sectors, although typically the private sector comprises the “vendor” market and the public sector the “client” market.  We consider both sectors in this course through the supply of GIS technology and services (e.g. how consultants might respond to an RFP) to the GIS user community and how needs are best articulated from the user community (e.g. how to write an RFP). </p><p><strong><u>Note:</u>  This is an advanced level class that requires your attendance every week to build your understanding of the issues and to be respectful to the guest speakers who freely donate their time and expertise.  <u>If you cannot commit to this standard, do not take this course.</u> </strong></p><p>The course is intended to provide senior undergraduate students with an overview of the various aspects of managing GIS in a workplace. The topics covered include considerations relevant to smaller operations and to complex, multi-user systems that run in large organisations. The topics complement the technical knowledge of spatial data, spatial databases and GIS applications that you will have acquired from GP381, GP387 and GP481.  In addition to covering the procedural issues involved in GIS management, some attention will be given to emerging trends in geospatial data and technologies as well as research and societal issues (for example, user-generated GI, big data).</p>

<p><strong>Web mapping assignment</strong></p><p>The range of choices in web-GIS and web mapping software has grown substantially and ranges from “no-code” configurable apps, through light weight Javascript mapping APIs, to more complex APIs and toolkits that use online services to enable some forms of spatial analysis and geoprocessing.  In this assignment, students will use and critically evaluate a selected set of web mapping software options to satisfy end-user requirements in an applied context. </p><p><strong>Request For Proposal (Response and presentation)</strong> </p><p>Depending on your role in the geospatial information industry, you may be charged with either compiling a bid to conduct work or evaluating competing bids.  To give you some experience in this, student consulting groups comprised of 3 or 4 students will write a response for a Request For Proposal (RFP).  Your group will be assessed primarily based on your written proposal (25%) with a further 5% of your grade based on a succinct presentation in our last class. <strong><u>Note that at least two members of your RFP team must be different from your web mapping team</u></strong>.</p><p><br/><strong>Technology workshop / guest speaker brief</strong></p><p>There will be a few times when a guest speaker from government or industry will join our class or we will have an in-class workshop.  These sessions are intended to give you exposure to speakers’ workplace expertise and/or exposure to interesting technologies (e.g. RFPs and procurement, big geodata, app development).  For <u>one</u> workshop or guest speaker’s presentation<u>,</u> you will write a concise (800 - 1000 words) brief in which you reflect on the implications of the topic matter for geospatial information or technology use in organizations.  <strong>You can complete this brief any time following our first workshop or guest speaker up to the date listed in our Class Schedule.</strong>  The end of term is a busy time in general and in this class so it may be wise to complete this before the due date.  Note: Demonstrations related to the web mapping assignment are excluded from this brief. </p><p><strong>Participation:</strong> </p><p>Your participation in our classes is both important for you to build your understanding of the course content and to be respectful of your classmates and any guest speakers we have.  Expect to come to class prepared and to contribute to class discussions.   </p><p><strong>End of Term test:</strong></p><p>The end of term test will cover materials from all classes, readings and speakers (check for updates on Learn).  It will be held during class time on March 24 as listed in the Course Schedule.  </p><p><br/><strong>Grades:</strong></p><p>The table below was adapted from the Faculty’s Teaching Handbook (2015) and provides general parameters associated with grade ranges. Note that very good quality work is assessed grades between 70-79 and that grades of over 80 are reserved for truly exceptional work.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Grade</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td>80 - 100</td><td>Grades in this category signal a sign of excellence and are not something that should be expected for work that simply meets the requirements of the assignment. In this category, a student has demonstrated a full understanding of the subject matter, has capacity to analyze, has demonstrated critical thinking, shows evidence of creative thinking, familiarity with literature and previous work in area, highly developed communication and presentation skills. The work is of outstanding quality according to the criteria established for evaluation.</td></tr><tr><td>70-79</td><td>Student has shown good comprehension of subject matter, evidence of critical and creative thought, familiarity with literature and previous work in subject area, competence in communication and presentation skills, but none of the above to the degree found in A category. The work is of very good quality according to evaluation criteria</td></tr><tr><td>60-69</td><td>Student has demonstrated some understanding of subject matter, can assimilate and communicate basic aspects of the subject matter. The work is of satisfactory or adequate quality according to evaluation criteria</td></tr><tr><td>50-59</td><td>Student has demonstrated minimal understanding of the subject matter, poorly developed communication skills, inability to apply subject matter understanding in other contexts, little evidence of critical or creative thinking. The work is of unsatisfactory but passable quality according to evaluation criteria.</td></tr><tr><td>0-49</td><td>Inadequate understanding of subject matter, failed to complete course requirements, no demonstration of critical thought, communication skills very poor.

Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office</p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Research Ethics:</strong> The University of Waterloo requires all research conducted by its students, staff, and faculty which involves humans as participants to undergo prior ethics review and clearance through the Director, Office of Human Research and Animal Care (Office). The ethics review and clearance processes are intended to ensure that projects comply with the Office’s Guidelines for Research with Human Participants (Guidelines) as well as those of provincial and federal agencies, and that the safety, rights and welfare of participants are adequately protected. The Guidelines inform researchers about ethical issues and procedures which are of concern when conducting research with humans (e.g. confidentiality, risks and benefits, informed consent process, etc.). If the development of your research proposal consists of research that involves humans as participants, the please contact the course instructor for guidance and see: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics</u></a></p><p> </p>
