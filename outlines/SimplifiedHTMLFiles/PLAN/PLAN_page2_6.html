  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>PLAN 639:</div>
<p>This course examines the relationship between the environment (built/physical, economic, social, political and natural aspects) and population health. It focuses on conceptual and empirical links among current environment-health issues such as air quality, active transportation, injury prevention, climate change, and mental well-being. Emphasis is placed on the role of urban planners in collaboration with allied professionals (e.g., public health, engineering, law enforcement, architecture) in creating and maintaining healthy built environments to improve population health with a focus on key health issues. The importance of multi-sectoral collaboration, healthy public policy and effective tools for assessing healthy communities will be illustrated using case studies.<br/>*eligible for MES.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended: </strong>This senior level course assumes basic knowledge of the link between the built environment and health. Students who are unfamiliar with this relationship are strongly encouraged to complete the recommended readings prior to the start of the course.</p><h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4><p>Planning and public health have a shared history: both professions emerged out of problems that grew out of the industrial revolution. This course will trace the history and evolution of both professions, academic disciplines, and will compare both theory and methods used. We will discuss particular health and planning issues (e.g., air pollution, physical activity, mental health and the built environment) as well as future cities. Increasingly, planning and public health organizations are realizing the importance of working together to improve urban health and equity. This course will provide an overview of the current issues in health and planning. This is a one term course with a credit weight of 0.5.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Learning Modes</u> </strong></h4><p>This class will take a flipped classroom approach. This type of approach is designed to increase student engagement during class. <u>Classes will be comprised of lectures that briefly summarize main points of each module</u>. Online lecture material covers conceptual and empirical examples/case studies of environment and health relationships. Online materials, media sources (videos, news stories), discussions, and activities will be used to highlight the application of course concepts to practice. Students are responsible for completing the required readings each week, and for keeping informed about course information through LEARN. There is no required text, and all readings are available through the course reserves. Readings have been selected to provide a balance of breadth and depth into important course concepts. This course will use LEARN to disseminate course material, as a communication tool, and post grades. Users can login to LEARN using your WatIAM/Quest username and password via: <a href="http://learn.uwaterloo.ca/">http://learn.uwaterloo.ca/</a> </p>

<p>There are three components you will be graded on in this course (see break: </p><ul><li>Reading Engagement (10 weeks x 2% each) = <strong><u>20% of overall mark</u></strong></li><li>Reflection Activities (11 weeks x 1.5% each (lowest mark dropped)) = <strong><u>15% of overall mark</u></strong></li><li>Annotated Bibliography = <strong><u>25% of overall mark</u></strong></li><li>Fact Sheet/Infographic and Issue Summary = <strong><u>15% of overall mark</u></strong></li><li>Assignment (20% final report, 5% presentation) = <strong><u>25% of overall mark</u></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Reading Engagement (worth 20% of your overall mark): </strong>Perusall will be used to collate and assess your engagement with course readings. A key part of your course experience involves learning through reading and purposeful engagement with materials assigned. Rather than reading on your own, we will be using Perusall – a software designed for collaborative reading where you will be annotating, questioning, and commenting on the assigned readings in groups of students. The completion of readings and your level and quality of engagement establish your grade.</p><p><strong>Activity Reflections (worth 15% of your overall mark): </strong>Activities in our seminars will happen every class from Wednesday January 15<sup>th</sup> to Wednesday April 2<sup>nd</sup>. Of the 11 activities (no activity first or last week) we will complete, each will be connected with an activity reflection worth 1.5% towards your final grade, with your lowest mark being dropped. The activities will be based on the module readings and lecture materials, and will take a variety of different forms, including but not limited to: readiness assurance tests, participating in discussions with your peers, creating concept maps, and think-pair-share activities. After each seminar activity, there will be a required activity reflection (200-300 word commentary on your experience in the seminar activity) that you will need to submit on LEARN (via the SubmitàQuizzes tab) by 11:59pm that Wednesday. The point of the activities is to 1) ensure that you are familiar with each week’s materials, and 2) encourage you to deepen your understanding of the topic in real time. To ensure that students who are feeling ill or have emergency situations are not penalized for missing class, you may instead request an alternate reflection question that the course instructor will develop based on the week’s topic.</p><p><strong>*Scaffolded Group Assignment (Annotated Bibliography [25%], Fact Sheet/Infographic and Issue Summary [15%], Final Assignment Report, Presentation [25%]): </strong>There is one larger group assignment in this course that consists of individual milestones which you will complete <u>on your own</u> in support of the group assignment. The final group assignment is due Sunday, April 6<sup>th</sup>, 2025, at 11:59pm (see <strong>Assignment Instructions</strong> in LEARN). As the focus of this course is the development of your ‘environment and health’ analytical and communication skills, the assignment is presented in a ‘scaffolded’ structure. This means that the assignment and its component parts will progressively build on each other as the course moves along. Smaller assignments will be administered earlier in the course and be completed to support your work in the next step of the assignment, and then larger and more heavily weighted assessments will be assigned later. This year the topics for your final group assignment, as well as the individual milestone components, will be connected to UW’s new Future Cities Institute. Your group will select a specific topic within one of the broad focus areas of the Future Cities Institute: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/future-cities-institute/interdisciplinary-research">Housing, AI/Machine Learning in City Planning/Building, Sustainable Infrastructure, or Mobility</a>. The final topic should be mutually agreed upon by all members of the group. You may connect your selected theme with any relevant health issue that you would like (e.g., healthcare access, mental health, active living, food systems, social cohesion/fragmentation). To contextualize these topics and provide additional information for your work, representatives from the Future Cities Institute will be making appearances in the course throughout the term. A summary of each part of the course assignment is as follows:</p><p><u>Part 1</u>: <strong>Annotated Bibliography</strong> - Annotated bibliographies are a method through which to summarize and critically appraise the quality of an evidence source with respect to the nature of the source, its reliability and validity (i.e., quality, limitations), and main findings. You will be responsible for conducting a review of <strong><u>10 potential* papers</u></strong> (<a href="https://lib.uwaterloo.ca/web/">please make use of UW Libraries if you need help</a> finding papers, resources) that relate to your group’s topic (*i.e., all of these do not need to be used in your group’s final report, these articles may be considered in your group’s final report). Again, you will be completing <u>your own</u> bibliography, <u>you are not</u> submitting one bibliography on behalf of your group. This is an <u>individual assignment</u> that you will be completing to aid your contribution to the final group report, and which will be marked based on your analytical and communication abilities. As such, each group member’s bibliography should be unique (i.e., you should not submit and appraise the same articles) and based on their own efforts and potential role within the group project. Each annotated article should be cited APA (6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> edition) at the start of the appraisal and be around 150-200 words for the analysis. The final annotated bibliography should use APA referencing, be single spaced, and present unique appraisals of each article (you are not to do appraisals with your group members). You will be submitting your annotated bibliography on LEARN.</p><p><u>Part 2</u>: **<strong>Fact Sheet/Inforgraphic and Issue Summary</strong> - Based on <u>your own</u> literature search and annotated bibliography (critical assessment of peer-reviewed academic journal articles, agency or governments reports) that you completed in the first part of this assignment, you will put together a fact sheet/infographic about this information. The fact sheet/infographic (Due March 26<sup>th</sup> submitted on LEARN) will be a one-page document on your topic that will use information from your annotated bibliography to: <u>i) describe the scope of the issue your group is addressing and any relevant background details the general public should know to understand this issue, ii) present an outline of the epidemiology (incidence, distribution) of the relevant health issue(s), iii) provide context about the availability (or lack thereof) of community resources and/or policies to address your group’s issue with respect to the local area, iv) and very briefly offer a point or two about the future of your issue</u>. The design is completely up to you! Remember you are communicating a complex topic to a general audience, so you will want to find a balance between the depth and accessibility of information presented. Use bullets, graphs, and images to effectively communicate your message. Be creative! </p><p>Second, you will be providing a summary of your group project issue, as you have learned about it on your own through the annotated bibliography and fact sheet/infographic. The summary should be an extension of the fact sheet/infographic where you provide additional context for the document and cite your sources. The summary should be structured according to the four points above (i.e., follows the same outline of material) and should be about 2 pages single spaced (not including references). Please use APA reference (6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> edition) style. The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize students with having to analyze and communicate complex environment and health topics to general (i.e., non-expert) audiences that in contemporary society often do not read policy reports but rather engage fact sheets, infographics, executive summaries, and other forms of high-level communications.</p><p>*<strong>Dimensions/specifics</strong>: We will be using examples from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The fact sheet/infographic should be 8.5” x 11” (i.e., the regular or default sheet size) and have a resolution of at least 300 dpi. Examples of fact sheets/infographics can be found on the CDC website (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/resources/infographics.htm">Spotlight Infographic section</a>) or via these links to infographics about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/spotlight/2019-heart-disease-disparities.htm">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/spotlight/2017-december.htm">adolescent health</a>, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/spotlight/HealthStats.htm">health status and determinants</a>. <u>Please be sure to include your name and student ID number on the fact sheet/infographic</u>. You may use whichever software you would like, just make sure your final output follows the above instructions. You will be submitting your fact sheet/infographic and summary documents on LEARN.</p><p><u>Part 3</u>: <strong>Final Assignment Report</strong> - The final assignment will be completed in groups of about 4-5 students from different programs, and that you will be assigned to in mid-January (closer to the term’s add/drop deadline). As a group, you will work together on your assignment throughout the term (there will be time made available across some of the Wednesday seminars to meet, but you will have to work together outside class time) and create a group contract that will outline the expected duties and contributions of all members. Given the individual milestones, <u>you will want to identify a group topic by early February to give yourself time to work on the annotated bibliography and fact sheet assignments</u>. Should a member of your group fail to meet their required duties (as per the group contract), they may be removed by the group. In the event of a removal, this student will be required to complete the same assignment on their own, as well as give an individual presentation to the course instructor and TA in April (please see Assignment Instructions for more information). Ultimately, <u>your group will put together a 10–13-page (double spaced, APA 6</u><sup><u>th</u></sup><u> or 7</u><sup><u>th</u></sup><u> edition) report</u> that connects your group topic with one of the municipalities or townships in the Region of Waterloo (you may may choose Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo, North Dumfries, Wellesley, Wilmot, Woolwich, or The Region of Waterloo). Additional assignment instructions can be found on LEARN. Final reports will be submitted on LEARN. </p><p><u>Part 4</u>: <strong>Final Assignment Presentation</strong> – After completing the written portion of the assignment, members of your group will also complete a presentation of your final assignment that will account for 5% of final grade. The final assignment presentation will be 3 minutes long, contain 6 slides (details are on LEARN), and will be presented by as few as two members or all group members (this is up to the group). All presentations will take place on the final Wednesday of the term (April 2<sup>nd</sup>). <u>Slides will need to be submitted to LEARN on April 1 by 3:00pm</u>. <u>You will be presenting the findings of your final reports to a guest panel of Future Cities Representatives</u>.</p><p><i><strong>*Detailed assignment instructions can be found on LEARN</strong></i></p><h4><u>Assignments</u></h4><p>The assignment description can be found under the <i>Syllabus and Assessments</i> content section in LEARN. Activities will be described in each class during class time. </p><h4><u>Student Evaluation</u></h4><p>The professor determines the content and establishes the grading rules for all assignments. </p><p>The teaching assistant(s) grades activities and assignments.</p><p><i>The apportionment which makes up the final grade is:</i></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><i>Course Component</i></td><td><p><i>Percentage</i></p></td></tr><tr><td><i>Reading Engagement (Perusall)</i></td><td><p><i><strong>20%</strong></i></p></td></tr><tr><td><i>11 Activities (lowest mark dropped for a total of 10 Activities counted, each worth 1.5%)</i></td><td><p><i><strong>15%</strong></i></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><i>Scaffolded Course Assignment</i></p><p><i>  Annotated Bibliography</i></p><p><i>  Fact Sheet and Issue Summary</i></p><p><i>  Group Final Assignment: Report</i></p><p><i>  Group Final Assignment: Presentation</i></p></td><td><p><i>(<strong>65%</strong>)</i></p><p><i>25%</i></p><p><i>15%</i></p><p><i>20%</i></p><p><i>5%</i></p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><i>When determining a student's final grade in the course, the professor will examine the record of each individual student's achievement; the final grade may be adjusted to take into account extenuating and compassionate circumstances and the student's general pattern of achievement in the course.</i></p><p><strong>Short Term Absence Declarations</strong></p><p>Short-term absence declarations will be dealt with in the following ways: </p><ol><li>If your declared absence coincides with a Reading Engagement due date, the Reading Engagement will be dropped and your grade will be reweighted to be out of 9 rather than 10 Reading Engagements.</li><li>If your declared absence coincides with an Activity, the Activity reflection will be dropped and your grade will be reweighted to be out of 10 rather than 11 Activities.</li><li>If your declared absence coincides with your Assignment, we will discuss a possible 24-48-hour extension on the Assignment for your group depending on the nature of your absence and role within the group</li></ol><p><strong>Requirements, Grade Penalties and Special Considerations:</strong></p><p>All penalties that could be assessed in the course must be specified here. Instructors are free to introduce penalties to ensure appropriate quality in student work. </p><ol><li><i><u>Readability and Clarity</u>: Students are expected to present well organized, and properly written work. Penalties of up to 25% may be applied in cases where readability and/or clarity are inadequate.</i></li><li><i><u>Computer Use:</u> Assignments must be completed by using a computer. Assignments may not be accepted or penalties assessed if a computer is not used.</i></li><li><i><u>Lateness penalty</u>: all assignments are due on the date set by the professor. Teaching assistants are NOT allowed to change the due dates. The first day an assignment is late brings about a 10% penalty. An additional 10% penalty is assessed for each additional late day. A student's assignment more than 4 days business days late will not be accepted and a grade of zero will be recorded for that assignment.</i></li><li><i><u>Requests for exemptions or compassionate considerations:</u> are to be discussed with the professor in advance or as soon as possible.</i></li><li><i>Requests for extensions AFTER the due date will not be considered. </i></li></ol><p> </p>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>. The following text is recommended:<br/><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Reading the syllabus:</strong> Professors spend a LOT of time and energy creating syllabi that we think are clear, and let students know what to expect and how to prepare. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, students often do not fully read the syllabus. If you’ve made it this far, you have demonstrated that you are preparing well for this course, and this preparation should be rewarded! Therefore, I will give one full bonus percent to any student who, in the Activity we complete on January 19<sup>th</sup> (my birthday!) wishes me a Happy Birthday in writing upon submission. </p><p><strong>Religious Observances</strong>: Students need to inform the instructor at the beginning of term if special accommodation needs to be made for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and assignments.</p><p><strong>Communications with Instructor and Teaching Assistants</strong>: All communication with students must be through either the student’s University of Waterloo email account or via LEARN. If a student emails the instructor or TA from a personal account they will be requested to resend the email using their personal University of Waterloo email account.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as analyzing environment-health relationships while considering relevant theory, methods, and practical approaches. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.
