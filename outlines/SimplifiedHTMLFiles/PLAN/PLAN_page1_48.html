<div>
<div>
<div>PLAN 471:</div>
<p>This course reviews the legal basis for planning in the province of Ontario. Students will examine how legal processes and statutory requirements, including relevant legislation, by-laws, and policies, guide land use planning. The primary focus will be on the division of authority between provincial and municipal governments, and the role of municipalities in making planning decisions. Students will further explore how planning law deferentially affects planners, municipalities, property owners, and residents.</p>

<div>
<div>PLAN 630:</div>
<p>A seminar in Planning Law using the case study approach. Although the emphasis is primarily on the law in Ontario, reference is made to planning law in other provinces for purposes of comparison. Planning issues dealt with by the Ontario Municipal Board are used to illustrate the power to regulate the use of land, the law relating to citizen participation, problems of non-conforming uses, and the maintenance of environmental quality in neighbourhoods and communities. Some general familiarity with law is desirable, but not essential. Estimated additional cost to student: $40.00</p>

<p><strong>Referencing / Citations:</strong></p><p>The School of Planning has adopted a single standard referencing system for all papers and assignments submitted in Planning courses.  The format is the APA (American Psychological Association) style for all formatting, in-text citations, and reference lists.  The complete style outline can be found in the <i><strong>Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</strong></i>, located in the reference section in Dana Porter Library or at the UW Bookstore. On the web you can find some other quick references for formatting and writing at the following URLs: </p><p>APA Frequently asked Questions - <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/">http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/</a></p><p>Purdue University Online Writing Lab (OWL): <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu">https://owl.english.purdue.edu</a></p><p>University of Wisconsin-Madison Writing Centre: <a href="http://www.writing.wisc.edu">http://www.writing.wisc.edu</a></p><p><strong>Requirements, Grade Penalties and Special Considerations:</strong></p><p><u>Lateness penalty</u>: All assignments are due by 11:59pm on the date set by the professor and should be submitted to the dropbox on Learn. A 10% penalty applied for each additional day late. Assignments more than five days late will not be accepted and a grade of zero will be recorded. <strong>Students are strongly encouraged to proactively seek extensions to avoid late penalties.</strong></p><p><u>Student absences: </u>Students who are absent due to illness or a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declared absence</a> should borrow lecture notes from a colleague to catch up on missed content. If an absence will impact an assignment due date, the student should reach out to the instructor immediately to discuss an extension. In the case of a missed test or examination, students will be offered a make-up at an alternate time.  <strong>No reweighting of tests or assignments will be permitted in this class.</strong><u> </u></p><p><u>Requests for exemptions or compassionate considerations</u>: Student requests are to be discussed with the professor in advance or as soon as possible. Decisions are at the discretion of the professor and/or Associate Director, Undergraduate Studies.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

The following text is recommended:<br/><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Generative AI</strong><br/>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions.</p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office</p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
