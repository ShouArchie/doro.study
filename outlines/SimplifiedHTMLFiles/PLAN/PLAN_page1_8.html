<p>Hello and welcome to <strong>transportation planning and mobility</strong>! Over the term, we will dive into understanding the planning that’s behind how we get around. The fact is that everyone relies on our transportation services and infrastructure. From day-to-day travel (like getting to school and work) to the often international journeys of our food, clothes, and online purchases to get to us- <strong>what we can do and when all comes down to the availability and quality of the transportation system</strong>. </p><p><strong>So, is it too bold to say that transportation systems define cities? </strong>I hope by the end of the course you will agree with me that it is not. The transportation system determines our access to the world around us and the form and function of our communities. It is a critical facet of urban planning that is intertwined with what makes sustainable, resilient, equitable cities. Although we will discuss the broad impact of all transportation, we will predominantly focus our attention on regional and municipal transport, with a fundamentally multi-modal approach that focuses on walking, cycling, transiting, and driving. </p><p>We’ve got a lot to cover over the next twelve weeks. To help you with the flow of this information, I’ve organized the course into four blocks, as follows: </p><ul><li>Block 1: why talk about transportation planning/mobility?</li><li>Block 2: what is transportation planning?</li><li>Block 3: how we plan for transportation today</li><li>Block 4: futures of transportation planning</li></ul><p>Through these four blocks, we will go over the history of transportation and how our current autocentric transportation systems came to be, followed by defining the scope and goals of transportation planning, including the fundamentals of network and demand planning. We will then get into the practicalities of ‘doing’ transportation planning, with a focus on the current political framework we plan within and the tools and techniques deployed by practicing transportation planners. Finally, we will end with an eye to the future- looking at where we can go from here. </p><p>At the end of the course, it is my goal that you walk away “seeing the system”, and the ways transportation planning impacts your daily lives and is intertwined to every other subset of urban planning. After all, transportation planning sits at an interesting intersection, sharing its field with engineers and urban designers alike! We will explore the ‘hard’ sides of transportation planning along with the ‘soft’ and not shy away from calling out where transportation planning has historically fallen short and the opportunities for the discipline to continuously improve. By the end of the course, I hope you can trace the many socio-political outcomes of how we plan for transportation and know the importance of understanding mobility and accessibility- for all urban planners + designers. </p><p>I’m so excited to dive into this course with all of you, so let’s buckle up (pun intended) and get into it! </p><p>-SL</p>

We will end this week’s discussion by going beyond modes and specifically looking at the user and tracing tangible and intangible barriers to transportation rooted in income, age, ability, race, and gender.  </p><p><strong>In-class activities:</strong> N/A</p><p><strong>Readings: </strong></p><ul><li>Chapter 6 Elements of Access (partial only pg 127-137).</li><li>Chapters 2, 5, 7, and 8 Human Transit (old version)</li></ul><p>(It looks like a lot this week, but I promise these are short chapters!)</p></td><td><i><u>In-tutorial reflection statement due</u></i></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>6</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Feb. 12</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Topic:</strong> Decisions, decisions: the human side of mode choice </p><p><strong>Description: </strong>This week we will apply what we’ve learnt from previous weeks and how the availability and quality of infrastructure (along with many other factors!) determines mode choice. We will also talk about what ‘mode choice’ really means- and the narrowness of the promised ‘choice’ for many. This will lead into discussion around demand modelling techniques (the good and the bad) and how transportation planners are meant to predict the future. </p><p><strong>In-class activities:</strong> <i>Presentation from co-op office during lecture time</i></p><p><strong>Readings: </strong></p><ul><li>Chapter 2, Elements of Access</li><li>Khairunnabila Prayitno &amp; Markus Moos: Freeing the ‘Captive’ Rider: Young Adults’ Public Transit Experiences in Toronto High-Rise Suburbs</li></ul></td><td><p><strong><u>Assignment 1 due Feb 13th. 11:59PM</u></strong></p><p><i>Assignment 2 + 3 introduced </i></p><p><i><u>In-tutorial reflection statement due </u></i></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><p><strong>Week of Feb. 17: Reading week! </strong></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><p><strong>BLOCK 3: HOW WE PLAN FOR TRANSPORTATION TODAY </strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>7</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Feb. 26</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Topic: </strong>The politics of transportation planning<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Description: </strong>We kick off Block 3 of this class with a discussion of the politics of transportation planning, including the various policies + plans that guide how transportation infrastructure comes to be and how responsibility is shared/transferred between different levels of government (including municipal, provincial, and federal) and external stakeholders. We will also discuss some of the core tensions in transportation planning, and how transport is wrapped up in debates of housing affordability, gentrification, and safety (to name a few). </p><p><strong>In-class activities:</strong> Block 2 20-minute quiz</p><p><strong>Readings: </strong></p><ul><li>Chapter 4, Inclusive Transportation</li><li>NACTO Global Street Design Guide: Chapter 2 ‘Shaping Streets’ (2.1-2.5)</li></ul><p><strong>Optional reading: </strong></p><ul><li>Emma MacDougall and Brian Doucet: ‘Polarized Paths: Selling Cycling in City and Suburb’</li></ul></td><td><i><u>In-tutorial reflection statement due </u></i></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>8</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Mar. 5</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Topic:</strong> Transportation engineering and development planning: standards, regulations, and measuring impact</p><p><strong>Description: </strong>This week we look at how engineering and development planning dictate transportation planning.

<p>We will be leaning on a collection of different books &amp; articles this term to supplement your learning, as shown in the table above. It is expected students complete their readings before tutorial time each week, as there will be some discussion on readings in the tutorial, and the tutorial reflection statements should draw on your thoughts from the readings.

<p><strong>Assignments (40% of total grade) </strong></p><p>There will be three assignments worth a total of 40%, each assignment is meant to have you apply key concepts and skills we learned in the lecture. More details on each assignment are included below, and specific assignment instructions will be circulated during the term. Assignments should be uploaded to a LEARN dropbox by the due date indicated on the course schedule.</p><ul><li>Assignment 1: <strong>Multi-Modal</strong> <strong>Accessibility Analysis (15%): </strong>In this assignment students will apply skills on how to define access across different modes, calculating accessibility for different modes based on distance, availability of infrastructure, quality of infrastructure, and personal experiences and perceptions.</li><li>Assignment 2:<strong> Transportation Policy Review (5%):</strong> In this assignment, students will apply learning on the various hierarchies and types of policy/planning tools that define and inform how transportation infrastructure comes to be. In this assessment, students should learn the differences between different scales + types of planning policy, recommendations, and guidelines.</li><li>Assignment 3:<strong> Mini-Active Transportation Master Plan, Group Assessment (20%) </strong>In groups of 4-5, students will conduct their own mini-active transportation master plan, building off the policy review conducted in Assignment 2. In this assessment, students will plan + justify a new route, option and choose appropriate infrastructure, cost/phase the project, and identify applicable stakeholders and potential concerns and conflicts with the development of their new infrastructure.</li></ul><p><strong>Quizzes/Exams (40% of total grade)</strong></p><p>At the end of each block, we will hold a ‘20-minute’ quiz (comprised of multiple-choice, true/false, and fill-in-the-blank questions). These quizzes are practice for the types of questions you may see on the final exam, and are meant as ‘check-ins’ for your overall understanding of course material. Each quiz is worth 5%, and there will be a quiz for Blocks 1, 2, and 3 (totalling 15%). The quizzes will be completed in the first 20-minutes of class, as indicated on the course schedule.  </p><p>At the end of the course, we will hold a final exam (worth 25%). This exam will include multiple choice, true/false, and fill-in-the-blank questions along with short and long answer questions. The exam will be two hours long and run during the exam period. Once the exam is scheduled it will be posted on LEARN. </p><p><strong>Participation &amp; reflection activities (20% of total grade)</strong></p><p>As part of this course, my goal is for you to not only understand the material but also apply it to your own life and reflect on what transportation &amp; mobility planning means to you. To encourage this, 20% of your overall grade can be achieved in participation &amp; reflection activities- of which there are two types:</p><ul><li><strong>Tutorial attendance and reflection statements (10%):</strong> Attendance will be taken in tutorials and some weeks you will be required to write a short (approx. 200-400 words) statement on the week's subject matter. These reflection statements will be submitted to a LEARN dropbox by 11:59pm on the day of the tutorial.  You do not need to include formal citations in your reflection statements, however they are welcome. This statement should be reflective, meaning you write your perspective and opinion. We will cover some basics of reflective writing practice in the lecture/tutorial, but some helpful links are included below.<ul><li><a href="https://www.rhulisc.com/blog/how-to-write-a-reflection-paper"><u>https://www.rhulisc.com/blog/how-to-write-a-reflection-paper</u></a></li><li><a href="https://libguides.cam.ac.uk/reflectivepracticetoolkit/reflectivewriting"><u>https://libguides.cam.ac.uk/reflectivepracticetoolkit/reflectivewriting</u></a></li></ul></li><li><strong>Travel journal (10%):</strong> Starting on the second week of class, I’d like students to start keeping a travel journal documenting their experiences getting to campus for PLAN 203. You can discuss details like timing, weather, traffic, interesting things you saw during your commute, and your overall feeling for your commute that week. During tutorials on March 26, we will have an opportunity to reflect on your travel journal entries from the past 10 weeks and your experiences commuting from home to campus. I’m adopting an open format to these travel journals- meaning you can be as creative as you like in how the entries look! They can be a combination of writing, drawing, mapping, or more. Simple bullet points in a Word document will also be accepted, of course. We will chat more about travel journal expectations in the first week of class. Just as with the other assignments, the travel journals should be submitted to a LEARN dropbox by the due date indicated in the course schedule.</li></ul><p><strong>Citations: </strong></p><p>The School of Planning has adopted a single standard referencing system for all papers and assignments submitted in Planning courses. The format is the APA (American Psychological Association) style. The complete style outline can be found in the <i>Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</i>, located in the reference section in Dana Porter Library, or on sale in the Book Store. You may also want to consult the following web resources: </p><ul><li>APA Frequently Asked Questions - <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/">http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/</a></li><li>Purdue University Online Writing Lab (OWL): <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/">https://owl.english.purdue.edu</a></li><li>University of Wisconsin-Madison Writing Centre: <a href="http://www.writing.wisc.edu/">http://www.writing.wisc.edu</a></li></ul><p><strong>Group work considerations: </strong></p><p>Assignment 3 will be completed in groups. Groups will be selected in tutorials. It is expected that group members will share the workload equally and assign tasks amongst themselves If any issues arise with group dynamics please get in touch with the instructor or TA as early as possible so we can assist in keeping the project on track. </p><p>For individual assignments, you may share ideas with your classmates, but please ensure the work submitted is your own. For more information on the University’s plagiarism policy see: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties</u></a> </p><p><strong>Late penalties: </strong></p><p>Late assignments will be penalized by 5% points per 24-hour period following the due date and time, including each weekend day up to one week after the original submission deadline. After that time, the assignment will receive a zero unless alternative accommodations are in place.  </p><p>There will be no late submissions permitted for the in-tutorial reflection statements. Students may miss one reflection statement without penalty (no marks lost).  </p><p><strong>If unable to submit assignments</strong></p><p>We work with AcessAbility Services (AAS) to provide accommodations. AAS is the University's centralized office for the provision of academic accommodations for students with a known or unknown disability, illness, or condition. Even if you're unsure of whether you qualify for AAS support, an AAS consultant can talk you through the next steps, and refer you elsewhere if appropriate. Please see more information here: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/</a> </p><p>If you find yourself unable to submit an assignment on time because of non-illness-or-accessibility-related reasons (such as conflicts with other courses, co-op interviews, or technical difficulties) please let the course instructor know as soon as possible, in writing by email, with your name, student ID, and e-mail contact. Supporting documentation may be required. If possible, an extension or alternative assessment will be assigned. Anticipate any requests for extensions well in advance. We require that extension requests be made a minimum of 72 hours before the due date/time. </p><p>If you cannot attend class for a Block quiz, please notify the instructor in advance of the quiz. Block quizzes will be reweighted to future/past quizzes. (i.e if a student misses the Block 1 quiz, the Block 2 quiz will be reweighted to 10% of the overall grade.)</p><p><strong>Note on AI: </strong></p><p>As noted in the below section on AI, we will be moving forward with a conditional permission of AI in this class. Simply put, if you use AI to help you complete an assignment you must cite it, explain how you used it, and justify why this use was valid for the assignment. </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office</p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>. The following text is recommended:<br/><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
