  Instructor &amp; TA (Teaching Assistant) Information
</h2>
<div>
<p>Dr. Brian Doucet firmly believes that academic knowledge should be shared with wider audiences to enhance not only scholarly debates, but also political, policy, planning and public discussions about cities and communities. He is a frequent commentator in the media and has experience and expertise speaking with a wide range of audiences about many important urban topics. Dr Doucet’s first full-length documentary film <i>Thinking Beyond the Market: a film about genuinely affordable housing, </i>will be released in early 2025.</p><p>Born and raised Toronto, he has also lived in the Scotland and the Netherlands. His interest in cities and transportation began at an early age; his childhood home was within earshot of the Yonge subway line and as a child, he spent many hours watching trains from the bridge over the tracks! This interest continues today as he gets to know cities around the world through walking, riding and photography. His favourite cities (in no particular order are: Montreal, Detroit, Rotterdam, Edinburgh, Brussels, The Hague, Toronto, Antwerp, Berlin)</p><p>Since 2017 he has been an Associate Professor in the School of Planning at the University of Waterloo. Prior to that, he taught geography and urban studies at Erasmus University in Rotterdam and Utrecht University, where he received his MSc and PhD. </p><p>Dr Doucet’s research interests focus on housing, neighbourhoods, urban change and transportation. He is particularly interested in the relationship between new transit lines and processes of gentrification and displacement. He 2works with a variety of public and non-profit partners to develop strategies to address the housing crisis. He has produced six scholarly books, the most recent being <i>Streetcars and the Shifting Geographies of Toronto </i>(2022, University of Toronto Press, with Michael Doucet), which examines long-term change in Toronto using historic and contemporary photographs of the city and its streetcars. He is also the co-editor (with Rianne van Melik and Pierre Filion) of the four-volume series <i>Global Reflections on COVID-19 and Urban Inequalities. </i>His first book <i>Why Detroit Matters </i>(2017, Policy Press) examined counternarratives and inspiring visions in Detroit.</p><p>Outside of academic work, he is an avid cyclist, a keen photographer and a big baseball fan! He was previously a competitive curler and represented the Netherlands at the European Curling Championships in 2008, 2010 and 2011. He currently resides in Kitchener with his wife, two young children and his golden retriever.

  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>PLAN 261:</div>
<p>This course explores the relationship between planning instruments and the urban land use market. It relates urban outcomes to interactions between market processes and planning interventions. It is in this light that it interprets changing urban land use and transportation patterns since the late 1940s, as well as contemporary urban issues. These issues are chosen so as to underscore differences in the circumstances confronting different zones of urbanization (core, inner city, inner suburb, and outer suburb).</p>

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement </strong></p><p> </p><p>The University of Waterloo is located on the lands of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is also situated on the Haldimand Tract, land promised to the Six Nations, which includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p> </p><p>This course examines different urban and metropolitan issues, as well as actual and possible planning responses in a number of different countries. The course aims to situate urban planning instruments, approaches and visions among the wide range of factors that influence urban development, urban change and transformations of cities and metropolitan regions. It explores the relationship between growth, development and real estate markets and various planning interventions at a variety of spatial scales. It will explore the capacities and limitations of planning on shaping the growth and development of cities. </p><p> </p><p>To do this, the course will be based around a number of foundational readings in planning and urban studies. This readings in this course are considered ‘must read classics’ for a deep and meaningful understanding of cities. Spanning a range of disciples and author-backgrounds, the course material will provide a foundation of knowledge that students can take with them into more specialized courses.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to a better understanding of the development and planning of cities and metropolitan areas, this course will improve students’ critical thinking skills, their ability to read and interpret planning literature, an enhanced understanding of international planning and development and the ability to combine their own observations with key planning theories, concepts and approaches.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Course Objectives</strong></p><p> </p><p>By the end of the course, you will be able to:</p><ol><li>Understand the common metropolitan planning and development issues and their policy responses in both Canada and an international context</li><li>Become familiar with key ideas, theories and approaches to planning and urban development</li><li>Understand how the growth and development of cities is related to current and past planning challenges</li><li>Analyze how and why metropolitan areas evolve in different ways</li><li>Interpret, summarize, synthesize and analyze key planning and urban studies literature and be able to link this literature with empirical examples in Canada and internationally</li><li>Develop critical thinking and analytical skills</li></ol><p> </p>

  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>No explicit learning outcomes defined for this course.</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Course Objectives</strong></p><p> </p><p>By the end of the course, you will be able to:</p><ol><li>Understand the common metropolitan planning and development issues and their policy responses in both Canada and an international context</li><li>Become familiar with key ideas, theories and approaches to planning and urban development</li><li>Understand how the growth and development of cities is related to current and past planning challenges</li><li>Analyze how and why metropolitan areas evolve in different ways</li><li>Interpret, summarize, synthesize and analyze key planning and urban studies literature and be able to link this literature with empirical examples in Canada and internationally</li><li>Develop critical thinking and analytical skills</li></ol><p><strong>Learning Modes and Expectations</strong></p><p> </p><p>The course is comprised of weekly, in-person lectures, delivered by Dr Doucet, and weekly tutorials, which will be led by Teaching Assistants (TAs). Lectures and tutorials will complement each other.</p><ul><li>Lectures will be led by Dr Doucet and will explain key concepts, delve deeper into important readings and provide empirical examples that both articulate the main theoretical or conceptual points, as well as provide grounding for the key concepts discussed in the course. The lectures will not be a ‘summary’ of the readings but instead will build on the course readings to enhance students’ knowledge of the material. It is expected that students will attend these lectures and will have read the required readings for each week, prior to the lectures.</li><li>The tutorials will divide the class into smaller groups of around 25 students. These weekly meetings will be led by TAs and will provide an opportunity for discussion, debate and smaller group activities. 10% of the class grade will be based on participation in tutorials. This grade will be a combination of attendance, active participation and completion of any tutorial activities, both in class and before/after. An additional 10% of the grade will come from a group presentation given in the final weeks of the tutorials. This presentation will link a selected city with some of the key literature from the course.</li></ul><p> </p><p>In this course, I strive to collectively create a learning environment where everyone is respected and valued. This helps to create a context where everyone can succeed. To do that, we expect a high-level of engagement in both the lectures and tutorials. Do not engage in activities such as texting, taking phone calls, surfing the internet as they can be a distraction to your fellow students or instructors. We also strive for upholding the principles of academic integrity and will discuss what this means throughout the course. If you are ever unsure about what academic integrity involves, please do not hesitate to ask. We understand that most of you are first-year students entering a new phase of your studies and that university education comes with very different expectation than other places of learning. </p><p> </p><p>It is extremely important to uphold an inclusive and respectful learning environment that is free from harassment and values diverse forms of contribution. It is also important that you raise any concerns or challenges you may be facing (illness, financial, care giving etc.) so that we can direct you to the relevant recourses available on campus. </p><p> </p><p>In this course, you are continuing on a journey to develop into a planner. That journey is about more than memorizing zoning rules! It is also about expanding your ideas. Some of you may already do this, but for others, this is a new opportunity and the start of a brand-new journey. Regardless of where you are on that path, I want this course to take you further than where you are today.</p><p> </p><p><strong>A note on Chat GPT or other generative AI software programs</strong>. The use of programs including, but not limited to: ChatGPT, Grammarly, Gemini, Apple Intelligence etc., is <strong>strictly prohibited</strong> within this course.  </p><p> </p><p>One of the main goals of this course is to develop critical thinking and observation skills in order to advance your journey towards ‘thinking like a planner.’ As a result, we are more interested in your own thoughts, ideas and knowledge about a topic and how these can all grow throughout the course, rather than what you can find and produce through a generative AI software program. To demonstrate that AI was not used to produce an assignment, students may be asked to show their rough work, drafts etc on an assignment if requested and written assignments and submissions will be placed through AI detection software and Turnitin.</p><p> </p><p>The course is also designed in a way that minimizes the possibility of using generative AI. Students will therefore be required to read and understand key course materials for tests and exams. Other assignments will rely on field trips and students’ own observations to successfully complete. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Student Drop-in Hours, LEARN Discussion Boards and Email Consultation</strong></p><ul><li><i><strong>LEARN Discussion Board:</strong></i> Use this function on the course’s LEARN website to pose questions that other students will benefit from knowing the answer to (e.g. questions about an assignment expectation or topics/outline of the exam). You can expect a response within 2 working days</li><li><i><strong>EMAIL</strong></i>: Use email for questions that are more personal in nature (e.g. specific challenges you are facing or a specific question about your topic for an assignment). You can expect a response within 2 working days (Mon-Fri), though please send a reminder if your answer is significantly delayed. Note that I do not regularly check my email in the evenings, weekends and during Reading Week<ul><li><i><strong>Email the course instructor</strong> (Doucet)</i> for questions about assignment extensions, issues/challenges with the course. </li><li><i><strong>Email your Teaching Assistant (TA)</strong> </i>for questions pertaining to the tutorials, initial questions about assignments (clarification, content), absences from the tutorials. Should the TA be unable to answer your question, it will be forwarded to Dr Doucet.</li></ul></li><li><i><strong>Note</strong>: Please only use your UWaterloo email account for correspondences within this course. Emails sent from other addresses (e.g. Gmail) will either be unanswered or returned with a request to re-send from your UWaterloo account. This will delay a response to your message.</i></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><i><strong>Scheduled Student Drop-in Hours: </strong></i>You are welcome to drop by my office (EV3-3249) Tuesdays between 10:30 – 12:30. You do not need to make an appointment. If you are unable to attend in person, please send me an email request to arrange a time during these drop-in hours</li></ul><p> </p>

Students will answer short, essay style questions that will focus on providing summaries of different readings, linkages between texts and relating course readings to other course materials. Each of these tests will count for 10% of the final course grade. Note that students are to remain in their tutorial class until the end of the time slot during these tests.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Tutorial participation:</strong> students are expected to attend and be active in tutorials. 10% of the final course grade will be based on their participation in tutorials. Students are expected to attend every tutorial. Verified illnesses (VIFs) and self-declared absences will not count towards the participation grade assessment. In addition to showing up to class, students are expected to engage in discussion and complete tutorial activities.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Group presentation:</strong> In weeks 9 and 10 (13 and 20 March), students will give short presentations about a selected city, linking this empirical example to key literature and materials from the course. These presentations will be graded separately from the tutorial participation grade.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Uptown review:</strong> During the tutorial on 27 March, Dr Doucet will lead a tour of Uptown Waterloo and provide instructions for an activity to take place during that time. Students will have an activity to complete during their tutorial time period and upload this to Learn at the end of their tutorial time. After that, they will write a reflective essay which uses a small number of course readings, plus additional literature to help interpret and analyze what was seen in Uptown Waterloo. This essay will include a map, photos and a 1200 – 1500 word essay. Prior to this, students will submit a proposal and structure of their essay. They will also need to select additional literature to use, which will be approved by the course instruction team. </p><p> </p><p>Students must fill in an online field trip form in order to participate in this tutorial. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/planning/form/plan-261-urban-metro-planning-de">This form can be accessed here.</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Final exam:</strong> a cumulative exam will be held during the examination period (9 – 25 April).

And must be submitted on LEARN in the designated Dropbox folders. Any assignments submitted after this deadline (even by a few minutes) will incur the following late penalties:</p><ul><li>5% for the first 24 hours</li><li>10% for each additional 24 hours (or part thereof)</li><li>Assignments received 6 days after the deadline will receive a grade of 0</li></ul><p> </p><p>Students may use a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/news/updates-self-declared-absences">self-declared absence</a>, which would extend the deadline for an assignment by 48 hours. This self-declared absence can only be used once during the formal lecture period, though students may still use the Verification of Illness Form or Self-Declaration for Flu-like Illnesses. </p><p> </p><p>Any questions pertaining to extensions should be directed to Dr Doucet. TAs are not permitted to grant extensions. Students should plan ahead and look carefully at all the deadlines for their courses; and requests for extensions must be written in an email. Under normal circumstances, extensions will not be given within 72 hours of the assignment deadline. </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office</p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>. The following text is recommended:<br/><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Research Ethics:</strong> The University of Waterloo requires all research conducted by its students, staff, and faculty which involves humans as participants to undergo prior ethics review and clearance through the Director, Office of Human Research and Animal Care (Office). The ethics review and clearance processes are intended to ensure that projects comply with the Office’s Guidelines for Research with Human Participants (Guidelines) as well as those of provincial and federal agencies, and that the safety, rights and welfare of participants are adequately protected. The Guidelines inform researchers about ethical issues and procedures which are of concern when conducting research with humans (e.g. confidentiality, risks and benefits, informed consent process, etc.). If the development of your research proposal consists of research that involves humans as participants, the please contact the course instructor for guidance and see: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics</u></a></p>
