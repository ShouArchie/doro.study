<p><strong>Ability to meet deadlines</strong></p><p>Rather than applying late penalties, students will be marked on their ability to meet deadlines. They will receive 2.5 marks for completing the case study proposal on time and 2.5 marks for completing the in-depth case study final report on time. No assignments or quizzes will be accepted after April 14 at 11:59 pm. Assignments or quizzes completed after April 14 will be graded as 0%.</p><p><strong>Weekly quizzes and exercises</strong></p><p>There will be 4 weekly quizzes/exercises throughout the semester. Quizzes/exercises will be based on weekly course content and they will be due on the Friday of each week. Each quiz will be worth 5% of the final grade.</p><p><strong>In-depth case study</strong></p><p>Students will work in groups. Each group will identify and choose a case study of a Healing Forest to focus on (<a href="https://www.nationalhealingforests.ca/">https://www.nationalhealingforests.ca/</a>). Students must find adequate secondary data or literature to support their case studies and collect primary data via a limited number of interviews. Students will analyze the data, conduct background literature reviews, and write about the case study.</p><p>The assignment is broken into three parts. The first part involves preparing a <u>Case Study Proposal (due January 27 by 11:59 pm)</u>, which details why the case was chosen, which issues will be explored, the data or literature used, and the methods or tools demonstrated or applied to the case. Students will hand in an electronic version of their proposal via Dropbox on the course Learn site (1-2 pages; 500 to 1,000 words). More details on how these will be evaluated will be provided in class.</p><p>The second part involves delivering an <u>in class presentation</u> about the case study. The presentations will take place on <u>March 24</u>. PowerPoint slides must be handed in on LEARN by 11:59 pm on the day before their presentation.</p><p>The third part involves preparing a <u>Final Case Study Paper (due March 31 by 11:59 pm)</u> (5-8 pages; 2,500 to 4,000 words exclusive of figures, charts and references). The final papers should be submitted via Dropbox on the course Learn site. More details will be provided in class.</p>

Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

Students can self-declare one Covid absence of up to 10 days and one absence for any reason for up to 2 days per term via Quest. Further absences require documentation, which students enter via vif.uwaterloo.ca. Absences will be accommodated according to the academic regulations section of the undergraduate calendar for all courses (graduate and undergraduate) in Environment. </p><p>In the event of instructor illness, classes will be temporarily suspended and in-person classes may be temporarily moved online, depending on the severity of instructor illness and self-isolation requirements.

The Guidelines inform researchers about ethical issues and procedures which are of concern when conducting research with humans (e.g. confidentiality, risks and benefits, informed consent process, etc.). If the development of your research proposal consists of research that involves humans as participants, the please contact the course instructor for guidance and see: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics</u></a></p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
