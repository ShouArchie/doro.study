</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>PLAN 477:</div>
<p>This course will focus on material flows from local to global, explored through the transportation land use interrelationships and systems lens. Students will learn the fundamentals of major freight modes, their relevant policy, regulatory and planning domains, and the complex roles, intersections, and impacts of freight in our communities. Students will develop/enhance their research, data analytics, and communication skills.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>This course is focused on the other aspect of spatial interaction and movement which is the movement of goods or freight.  It is an often overlooked aspect of transportation systems study but no less important, especially given its fundamental role within the functioning of our modern socio-economic systems.  Modern production and retailing depends on the freight system – air, rail, road and marine – like never before. Obviously, these systems are an integral part of, and impact our urban/region in diverse ways.  In this course, we will explore these impacts and influences by looking at transportation, planning and policy from a freight perspective.</p><p> </p>

<p><strong>Learning Modes and Expectations</strong></p><p>A number of important propositions inform the evaluation and overall course experience</p><p>•The instructor is the guide/facilitator and the student is the one responsible for the learning – the student plays a key role in directing the course experience </p><p>•In their role, students are expected to be active course participants – beyond “being there” ( participating in classes) – you will be vocal, critical and engaged in the course experience and activities</p><p>•Evaluation will focus on assessing key learning outcomes with an emphasis on concise presentation of arguments, descriptions, and opinions. </p><p>•Reading with purpose (critically) – academic papers, government reports, and other media is necessary to build a knowledge foundation – readings will be central in this course and ultimately reflected in your assessments (required readings engagement)</p><p>The weekly meet time in this course will consist of active learning, discussions and lecture, the latter being the main vehicle for introducing and exploring our topics.  Lecture frameworks will be provided in certain classes and are to be used in addition to your note taking. Our topic exploration is supplemented very heavily by your experiences and integration of references materials and required readings.</p><p>The two individual assignments, readings engagement and a group project are designed to facilitate your exploration of freight related topics and provide an opportunity for critical assessment and reflection.  An overview of each of these components is provided below and further details will be provided as we progress through the term.</p><p>Sequence of Course Topics &amp; Readings</p><p>Students are responsible for all the topics listed below – required readings will be provided.

<p><strong>Assignments:</strong></p><p>1.  Freight Audit (Due Feb 3.)</p><p>One of the major challenges facing the goods movement (freight) sector is that despite their essential nature, they are often an overlooked part of the broader planning and society realm. One famous quote is that planners need to move from a “regulate and restrict” mindset to an “understand and accommodate” mindset.  To that, the Province of Ontario has developed a draft set of “Freight Supportive Guidelines” (MTO, 2016) and others have advocated for communities to employ a “freight filter” in their planning, thinking about freight dimensions in all planning.   A key to these efforts is developing a clear picture of the current status of a community’s freight system/sectors (all systems and modes), their issues and prospects for the future – a freight audit – with an emphasis on a comprehensive review of current status.  In this assignment, you will be completing a freight audit for one of Canada’s major cities (Census Metropolitan Area – CMA).</p><p>2.  Freight Generators: Logistics Land Uses and Challenges (Due Mar. 10th)</p><p>The goal of this assignment is to explore and assess the industrial and logistics related land uses and developments for the city you audited in Assignment 1.  The focus here is on identifying and describing the range of logistics related spaces in your city, providing a current assessment of the industrial land market, and profiling a recent logistics development in terms of the site form and function, and relevant planning considerations and issues.  The range of spaces gives room to move from major Distribution Centers (DCs) and fulfilment centers to local delivery stations and industrial condominiums. The objective is to broaden your traditional land use planning mindset to embrace industrial and logistics land uses as well.</p><p><u>Readings Engagement</u></p><p>Part of the course evaluation will be student engagement with the readings assigned in advance of each week. The reading engagement takes place in <strong>the Perusall System</strong>, an online workspace accessed through our course Learn site. Students are expected to comment, question, and discuss the readings collaboratively in groups established at the beginning of the course.  Your level of reading engagement is graded in terms of quantity and quality. It is reading with purpose and sharing your perspectives and understanding of the materials with each other. </p><p><u>The Freight (Great) Debate – Group Project</u> (Main element Due March 28th.– interim elements due periodically through term)</p><p>The significant cumulative assessment in this course (like a final exam) is the Oxford style debate that will occur in our last class (April 3rd) .  Collectively, we will establish 4 major debate topics (statements) that will be the focus of teams throughout the term.  Pairs of teams will be assigned to each topic and will prepare to debate their topic during the final week of classes.  This debate will involve 2 team members taking on the debating role for each side with the class assessing the debate outcome.  The pairs of teams will not know which side of the debate proposition they are on until 48 hours before the assigned class debate time.  Required elements for grading will include the main element of your debate preparation materials, and of course, performance in the debate itself.</p><p><i><u>Lateness penalty:</u></i> All assignments are due on the date set by the professor. If a student submits later than that, a 10% penalty is incurred for each 24-hour period that the assignment is late. Students should contact the instructor to request an accommodation for illness and bereavement.</p><p><i><u>Referencing / Citation:</u></i> The School of Planning has adopted a single standard referencing system for all papers and assignments submitted in Planning courses. The format is the APA (American Psychological Association) style. The complete style outline can be found in the <i>Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</i>, located in the reference section in Dana Porter Library, or on sale in the Book Store. You may also want to consult the following web resources: </p><ul><li>APA Frequently Asked Questions - <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/">http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/</a></li><li>Purdue University Online Writing Lab (OWL): <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/">https://owl.english.purdue.edu</a></li><li>University of Wisconsin-Madison Writing Centre: <a href="http://www.writing.wisc.edu/">http://www.writing.wisc.edu</a></li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
