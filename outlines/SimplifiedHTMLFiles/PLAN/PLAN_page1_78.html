<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>PLAN 442:</div>
<p>This advanced course uses conceptual readings and contemporary case studies from Canada and other settler-colonial contexts to critically examine how planning initiatives in both urban and rural contexts relate to the rights and aspirations of Indigenous peoples. Students will also explore the possibilities for planning that is grounded in the knowledge, perspectives, and lived experiences of Indigenous peoples.</p>

<div>PLAN 674:</div>
<p>These courses allow for additions to the program on a short-term basis, and for development of future permanent courses. Eligible for MES (subject to approval of the School of Planning Graduate Officer).</p>

<p>The planning profession is currently reconsidering its relationship with Indigenous peoples, as it seeks to respond to increased recognition of Indigenous rights, to the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and to the political efforts of Indigenous communities themselves as they reclaim and reassert their own planning traditions. This course aims to better prepare students for this challenging area of professional practice by delving into the small but rapidly expanding body of scholarly and practical work on planning with Indigenous peoples. It uses conceptual readings and contemporary case studies from a range of settler-colonial contexts to critically examine how community planning initiatives in both urban and rural contexts relate to the aspirations of Indigenous peoples. These readings will be supplemented with various policy statements and guides to develop students’ understanding of the changing legal and political context for municipal and provincial planning with Indigenous peoples. The course also explores the possibilities for Indigenist planning, or planning that is grounded in the voices, knowledges and lived experiences of Indigenous peoples.</p><p>Students from other programs and disciplines are welcome in this course. It is strongly recommended that all students have a good understanding of what professional planners do and the range of contexts and problems they work on.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Learning Modes</strong></p><p>This is a seminar class, with minimal lecturing and lots of discussion. We will use a modified version of the ‘flipped classroom’, which is a style of learning in which the substantive content is delivered ahead of time and class time is freed up for discussion and interactive activities. I say ‘modified’ because flipped classrooms do not typically have any in-class lecturing and my plan is to give a short lecture to set up our discussion. To prepare, you must 1) annotate the required readings and 2) watch and compose a short reflection on the assigned documentary film (if assigned). Our seminar discussions will focus on making connections across all the assigned content. Our classes will be shorter on the weeks that we have a film, to offset the extra time that you put into preparing for class.</p><p>It is very important that we collectively create a learning environment where everyone is respected, valued, and has a chance to succeed. To do this, I ask that you:</p><ul><li>Strive for high-level of engagement in lectures and tutorials and do not engage in activities that could be a distraction to others (e.g., texting, taking phone calls, surfing the internet).</li><li>Uphold the principles of academic integrity and honesty in all your work. Students are often unsure what constitutes an academic integrity violation, so please don’t be afraid to ask.</li><li>Work to uphold an inclusive and respectful learning environment that values diverse contributions and is free from all forms of discrimination and harassment. Some level of debate and disagreement is to be expected, but remarks and non-verbal behaviours that are demeaning and dismissive are not ok and should be brought to the attention of a member of the teaching team. This applies to me too, so if you ever feel that I missed the mark please let me know.</li><li>Raise any concerns or challenges (e.g., illness, financial pressures, caring responsibilities) that may be affecting your performance, so that resources can be shared and strategies can be developed (sometimes in coordination with other services on campus).</li></ul><p> </p>

<p role="note">The course learning objectives will be evaluated through assignments and class participation. Brief descriptions of the assignments are provided below. You will be given a detailed brief on each of the assignments at least three weeks before it is due. These briefs, which will be posted on LEARN, provide additional detail on my expectations and grading criteria.<br/><br/>Referencing / Citation: The School of Planning has adopted a single standard referencing system for all papers and assignments submitted in Planning courses. The format is the APA (American Psychological Association) style. The complete style outline can be found in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, located in the reference section in Dana Porter Library, or on sale in the Book Store. You may also want to consult the following web resources: <br/>-	APA Frequently Asked Questions - http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/ <br/>-	Purdue University Online Writing Lab (OWL): https://owl.english.purdue.edu <br/>-	University of Wisconsin-Madison Writing Centre: http://www.writing.wisc.edu <br/><br/>Readability and Clarity: Students are expected to present well organized, and properly written work using a computer. Penalties of up to 25% may be applied in cases where readability and/or clarity are inadequate. <br/><br/>Lateness penalty: All assignments are due on the date set by the professor. A 5% penalty is incurred for assignments submitted less than 24 hours of the deadline. An assignment that is submitted even one minute late will incur this penalty, so make sure that you leave enough time to address any technical glitches. Assignments submitted between 24 and 72 hours after the deadline will incur a 10% penalty for each additional 24-hour period that the assignment is late. For example, if the deadline is September 16 at 11:59 pm and the assignment is submitted on September 19 at 10:30 pm, it will incur a 25% penalty (5% for between 11:59 pm on Sept 16 and 11:59 pm on Sept 17, 10% for between 11:59 pm on Sept 17 and 11:59 pm on Sept 18, and 10% for between Sept 19 and 10:30 pm on Sept 19). Assignments that are more than 72 hours late will not be accepted unless an arrangement was made with the professor.<br/><br/>Requests for exemptions or compassionate considerations: Students may use a self-declared absence, which would extend the deadline for an assignment by 48 hours. This 48-hour absence currently only applies to undergraduate students, but this course will extend it to graduate studies as well. Undergraduate students need to declare their absence via Quest. Graduate students must notify the professor. This self-declared absence can only be used once during the formal lecture period, though both undergraduate and graduate students may still use the Verification of Illness Form or Self-Declaration for Flu-like Illnesses. All other requests are to be discussed with the professor in advance of the assignment due date or as soon as possible.<br/></p>

<p>The course learning objectives will be evaluated through assignments and class participation. Brief descriptions of the assignments are provided below. You will be given a detailed brief on each of the assignments at least three weeks before it is due. These briefs, which will be posted on <i>LEARN</i>, provide additional detail on my expectations and grading criteria.</p><p> </p><p><i><strong>Assignment 1 (40%): </strong></i><strong>Analysis &amp; Recommendations for Indigenous/non-Indigenous planning relations</strong></p><p>In this two-part assignment, you will assess how well planning within a Canadian city or region of your choosing reflects the principles of reconciliation and of a renewed relationship with Indigenous peoples (discussed in Week 2). You will then use precedents from elsewhere to suggest areas for improvement.</p><p><strong>PART A (20%):</strong> In this part, you will assess how well planning efforts within your chosen city/region are enacting the principles. You must carefully support your assessment with clear examples from your city/region. <strong>DUE: Friday Feb. 14, by 11:59 pm</strong></p><p><strong>PART B (20%):</strong> In this part, you will use examples from the readings, lectures, and case study presentations, as well as any precedents that you find on your own, to make recommendations on how your chosen city/region could improve its planning relationships with Indigenous peoples. <strong>DUE: Friday April 4, by 11:59 pm</strong></p><p> </p><p><i><strong>Assignment 2 (20%): Case Study Presentation</strong></i></p><p>For this assignment, you will research and deliver a case study presentation of a planning process or project that relates to one of the weekly themes from weeks 5 to 9. In addition to presenting the facts of your case, you must also make connections to the theme and assigned readings for that week. For undergraduate students, the case studies are pre-determined, and you may work in pairs. Graduate students work alone and are encouraged to find a case study that connects to their own research in some way. <strong>DUE: in class on your assigned week</strong></p><p> </p><p><i><strong>Reading Annotations (20%) </strong></i></p><p>This component accounts for the quality and depth of your engagement with the readings, as well as your level of in-class participation. Instead of individual reading responses posted on LEARN, we will be using Perusal, an interactive tool for annotating documents. Each week, you will need to use the tool to leave questions and comments on the required readings. This exercise is integral to the success of our flipped classroom; it is also a graded component of the class as <i>Perusal </i>includes an algorithm (that I set the parameters of) to score your annotations.</p><p> </p><p><i><strong>Engagement (20%)</strong></i></p><p>This portion of your grade accounts for your in-class and online engagement. In-class engagement can take many forms, including attendance and participating in group discussions (while also taking care to allow others to speak). Online engagement refers to the short, 200 to 300-word reflections you must post before class on the weeks that we have assigned videos.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>. The following text is recommended:<br/><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Research Ethics:</strong> The University of Waterloo requires all research conducted by its students, staff, and faculty which involves humans as participants to undergo prior ethics review and clearance through the Director, Office of Human Research and Animal Care (Office). The ethics review and clearance processes are intended to ensure that projects comply with the Office’s Guidelines for Research with Human Participants (Guidelines) as well as those of provincial and federal agencies, and that the safety, rights and welfare of participants are adequately protected. The Guidelines inform researchers about ethical issues and procedures which are of concern when conducting research with humans (e.g. confidentiality, risks and benefits, informed consent process, etc.). If the development of your research proposal consists of research that involves humans as participants, the please contact the course instructor for guidance and see: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics</u></a></p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.
