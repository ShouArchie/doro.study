<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgment:</strong> </p><p>The University of Waterloo is located on the lands of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is also located on the Haldimand Tract, land promised to the Six Nations, which includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.</p><h4><strong>Introduction:</strong></h4><p>Planning takes place within complex decision-making environments. Planning issues concern many, diverse participants: community residents, local politicians, special interest groups, government agencies - in short, anybody with an interest in a planning matter. Quite often, planners find themselves in situations where there can be conflict about the type, extent and impact of changes in land use. In these situations, there is usually recourse to an arm’s length body that could adjudicate the matter. In this course, we will explore how jurisdictions in Canada and internationally manage these adjudication processes. We will also learn about alternative dispute resolution strategies and tools that can be applied in conjunction with, or instead of, the tribunal system model.</p><p><strong>Communication:</strong></p><p>The Learn site will be the primary means of communicating with course participants. Discussion Boards will be set up for each Assignment; please post your questions or suggestions about the Assignments on the Discussion Boards. Please also monitor Announcements; the TAs and I will use that platform for course updates.</p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<h4><strong>Course Structure</strong></h4><p><i><strong>A. Common Planning Tribunal Models</strong></i><br/><br/><strong>Week 1 - January 9     </strong><br/><i><strong>Key Trends and Sources of Conflict in Planning Practice</strong></i><br/><strong>Learning Objective: </strong>To explore common types of, and reasons for, conflict and dispute in planning.<br/><strong>Content:</strong> This session starts with an overview of key trends; this provides context for our discussion of planning-oriented conflict. A significant amount of urban and regional planning practice is characterized by differences of opinion and, often, conflict amongst stakeholders in the planning process. These situations can occur in many aspects of land use planning - for example, in applications to change established land uses, zoning, and planning policy, health of ecosystems, access to groundwater, and the prospect of aggregate mining. Several of the common sources of conflict, and the varying roles of stakeholders, are addressed in this module.</p><p><strong>Week 2 - January 16       </strong><br/><i><strong>Planning Tribunals Elsewhere in Canada</strong></i><br/><strong>Learning Objective: </strong>To become familiar with the design and administration of planning tribunals outside Ontario.<br/><strong>Content:</strong> According to the Canadian Constitution (1982), land use planning and resource management is a provincial responsibility. Each Province and Territory has a version of a planning tribunal or similar appeals body. In this module, the key characteristics of these other provincial systems will be reviewed.</p><p><strong>Week 3 - January 23   </strong><br/><i><strong>Planning Tribunal Models: The International Experience</strong></i><br/><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> To become familiar with the types of planning conflict adjudication models that are used in other countries.<br/><strong>Content:</strong> Some form of adjudication model and process is used in many other countries. In this module, we'll review how planning tribunals are designed and managed in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Similarities and some differences will be evident in these international approaches.</p><p><i><strong>B. Working With(in) the OLT Model</strong></i><br/><br/><strong>Week 4 – January 30  </strong><br/><i><strong>Ontario Land Tribunal – Mandate, Policies and Processes</strong></i><br/><strong>Learning Objective: </strong>To become familiar with the OLT’s mandate and scope of activities.<br/><strong>Content:</strong> The current tribunal model – the Ontario Land Tribunal (OLT) – was established in 2021. The OLT consolidated several special-purpose tribunals into a single organizational structure. Planning is one of several areas of interest; complementary areas include expropriation, mining, heritage, and the environment, each of which is addressed through specific legislation (e.g., Planning Act). In this session, the mandate, related legislation, and key policy and process elements of the OLT will be reviewed.<br/><strong>Guest Speaker:</strong> Scott Tousaw, Vice-Chair, Ontario Land Tribunal</p><p><i><strong>B. Working With/In the OLT Model</strong></i><br/><br/><strong>Week 5 - February 6    </strong><br/><i><strong>Ontario Land Tribunal – Planning Jurisdiction and Appeals</strong></i><br/><strong>Learning Objective: </strong>To become familiar with the appeals and decision-making processes of the OLT.<br/><strong>Content:</strong> The Ontario Land Tribunal (OLT)’s planning jurisdiction is considerable and includes hearing and deciding appeals regarding several related areas of concern. The OLT can hear appeals about a wide range of planning concerns such as official plans, zoning by-laws, and a host of other familiar planning tools (e.g., subdivision plans, consents, and minor variances). In this session we will have insights about the OLT from a professional planner with experience before this tribunal.<br/><strong>Guest Speaker:</strong> Garrett Stevenson, Director of Development and Housing Approvals, City of Kitchener </p><p><strong>Week 6 - February 13  </strong><br/><i><strong>Ontario Land Tribunal – The Lawyer's Perspective</strong></i><br/><strong>Learning Objective: </strong>To consider the OLT tribunal model from the perspective of a key participant: the lawyer.<br/><strong>Content:</strong> In our two previous OLT-oriented sessions, we heard from the Vice-Chair of the OLT, and from a planner with experience about this tribunal. The role(s) of the lawyer are critical in this process. In this session, we explore the lawyer's perspective on the Ontario Land Tribunal.<br/><strong>Guest Speaker:</strong> Eric Davis, LLB. Lawyer with SV Law (Guelph, ON)</p><p><i><strong>Week 7 – February 17-23 Reading Week</strong></i><br/>No class scheduled.</p><p><strong>Week 8 – February 27            </strong><br/><i><strong>The Politician's Perspective On/Experience With the OLT</strong></i><br/><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> To become aware of the roles played by local elected officials, and the implications of the OLT process on municipal decision-making.<br/><strong>Content:</strong> Without question, members of local or regional government Councils play a really important role in the planning system generally. They also need to make decisions that are informed by different perspectives on a planning matter. Sometimes, these matters must be referred to the OLT for resolution. What are the implications for local government autonomy and Council decision-making?<br/><strong>Guest Speaker:</strong> Jeff Henry, Urban Planner, Arcadis Consultants (Waterloo) and former Councillor, City of Waterloo</p><p><strong>Week 9 - March 6</strong><br/><i><strong>The Developer's Roles in/Views of the OLT process</strong></i><br/><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> To become familiar with the perspectives and experiences of key actors in the planning system - developers.<br/><strong>Content:</strong> Developers are key actors in urban planning: they are the people who make tangible planning policies. How do developers view the roles and powers of the OLT? What are the implications for project advocates of this adjudication and review process? A representative of the development industry will share their perspectives on the OLT process.<br/><strong>Guest Speaker:</strong> Larry Kotseff, MCIP, RPP.  Vice-President (Real Estate Development), Solowave Investments (Waterloo)</p><p><i><strong>C. Experiences and Future Directions in Dispute Resolution</strong></i></p><p><strong>Week 10 - March 13</strong><br/><strong>A</strong><i><strong>lternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)</strong></i><br/><strong>Learning Objective: </strong>To explore alternatives to the formal planning tribunal model.<br/><strong>Content:</strong> In recent years, the more progressive jurisdictions have introduced dispute and conflict resolution models that are considered less expensive or adversarial than the traditional court-based model or planning tribunals. In this module, the key characteristics of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) tools and methods will be discussed.<br/><strong>Guest Speaker: TBA</strong></p><p><strong>Week 11 – March 20</strong><br/><i><strong>Interest-Based Negotiation</strong></i><br/><strong>Learning Objective: </strong>To learn what it means to design and manage an interest-based negotiation process.<br/><strong>Content: </strong>It can seem so difficult to arrive at a “win-win” conclusion to a conflict situation, whether it’s inter-personal or regarding a conflict-ridden planning matter. In this session, we’ll explore the idea of interest-based negotiation, and consider the strengths and challenges associated with this strategy. <br/><strong>Guest Speaker: TBA</strong></p><p><strong>Week 12 – March 27</strong><br/><i><strong>When It Doesn’t Work Out…</strong></i><br/><strong>Learning Objective:</strong> To look for lessons learned from a failed or unsatisfactory negotiation experience.<br/><strong>Content: </strong>Sometimes, despite one’s best effort, negotiations fail. There can be all kinds of reasons for that outcome – i.e., the personalities involved, historical interactions, perhaps problems with the negotiation process design and management. In this session, we’ll examine common issues that can undermine negotiations, and review how to prepare for the next negotiation opportunity.<br/><strong>Guest Speaker: TBA</strong></p><p><strong>Week 13 – April 3</strong><br/><i><strong>Case Study – City of Waterloo</strong></i><br/><strong>Learning Objective: </strong>To acquire a good understanding of how projects evolve and change with the influence of the OLT, and through effective use of ADR, negotiation, and mediation.<br/><strong>Content: </strong>In this final course module, we will explore how ADR has been applied in a real-world development case. We will also consider the nature of the relationship between ADR and the Ontario Land Tribunal decision-making process.<br/><strong>Guest Speaker: TBA</strong></p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
