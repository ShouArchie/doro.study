<div>
<div>
<div>PLAN 233:</div>
<p>This course explores the origins and practices of social planning and its relationship to the field of community development. Students will learn how interventions in the built environment and urban policy-making can be used to advance community well-being and human flourishing. Students will focus on the relationship between planning practice and social outcomes, and the importance of considering social objectives alongside the economic and environmental priorities of sustainable development. Students will expand their skills in demographic analysis to assess community needs through mapping community assets, resources, amenities, and services that support the advancement of complete communities.</p>

<p>Planners are increasingly acknowledging imperatives towards improving social outcomes through planning (e.g., planning for social justice, equity, diversity, inclusion). Accordingly, this course introduces concepts of social planning and community development in the field and practice of planning. The first half of the course (Week 1-6) focuses on foundational aspects of social planning and community development, that is, the constructs and concepts that bridge the intersection between the purpose and implications of planning to people and place. The second half of the course (Week 7-12) delves in depth on selected topics that are applicable to social planning and community development by critically alluding to the prospective planner as an actor in this work.</p><p>This course incorporates theoretical and applied learning opportunities that involve critical thinking about the context of planning and planners in social planning and community development. Course assignments will involve the development of technical skills such as the assessment and interpretation of community and demographic needs, to interpersonal skill development as related to the attentiveness of communication and language in planning deliverables. Comprehension of course material (i.e., course concepts and required readings) will be assessed in the Midterm Exam. Students are required to attend weekly tutorials, as a portion of the overall grade, where tutorials will provide an opportunity for further application of course material to learning and assignments. Weekly required readings must be read prior to lecture and tutorial. Additionally, guest speakers may attend lectures throughout the term. </p>

<p><strong>Midterm Exam: </strong>Students will be writing the Midterm Exam in-person, at the University of Waterloo campus. Accordingly, students will be required to be present on the Midterm Exam date and location.</p><p><strong>Assignment 1</strong>: Students will work in small groups, as determined in Tutorial 1, to assess community and demographic needs as the broad purpose of the assignment. The deliverable of this assignment will be a written report; details are provided in the Assignment 1 Guidelines posted on LEARN. Students will upload their submission to the LEARN dropbox. Late penalties will apply (see below).</p><p><strong>Assignment 2:</strong> Students will work independently to produce a deliverable that applies course learnings with individual reflection to planning. The details of this assignment and its deliverables are provided in the Assignment 2 Guidelines posted on LEARN. Students will upload their submission to the LEARN dropbox. Late penalties will apply (see below).</p><p><strong>Tutorial Participation:</strong> Students will be required to attend and actively participate in weekly tutorials, and will be assessed accordingly.</p><p><strong>Course Policies for Late Submissions:</strong> Late submissions will have percentage deductions applied to the original grade for the assignment. Each late day (defined as a Calendar Day-including weekends) will receive a 5% grade deduction. No submissions will be accepted after 4 late Calendar Days, where a grade of zero will apply after the fourth (4th) late day.

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office</p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Generative AI</strong><br/>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement.

However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
