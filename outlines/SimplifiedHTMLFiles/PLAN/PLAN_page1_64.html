<p>Spatial analysis techniques are developed and applied in diverse fields such as geography, spatial epidemiology, spatial econometrics, geocomputation, and spatial statistics to explain and predict spatial phenomena. Today, spatial analysis is mainly based on statistical techniques and geoprocessing using geographic information systems (GIS). The spatial character of data implies several methodological challenges in spatial data analysis especially related to the spatial dependence of the data, which often invalidates non-spatial modeling and evaluation approaches and leads to special techniques for spatial sampling and spatial regression modeling.</p><p>This course gives an overview of statistical and computational techniques for spatial regression modeling, spatial classification, spatial interpolation, and point pattern analysis. In addition, selected topics such as spatial data mining and spatial analysis software may be addressed, depending upon the progress of the course. Several real-world applications of spatial analysis techniques will be discussed and provide context for course assignments. </p>

<p>The course has been structured to have weekly assignments that collectively account for 65% of the course content. These assignments will be completed online using a combination of LEARN and Jupyter Notebooks with R Statistics packages. Assignments commence in the second week of the course but the first week will require students to setup a workflow for using Jupyter Notebooks on the Math Faculty Jupyter Hub, which can be found here: <a href="https://jupyter.math.uwaterloo.ca/hub/login">https://jupyter.math.uwaterloo.ca/hub/login</a></p><p>There are no serious programming requirements or extensive prior knowledge of geographic information systems to complete the assignments in this course. The notebooks will guide you through the technical steps and students will adjust notebook content/code to improve their understanding about the statistical and spatial analysis concepts discussed in the course.</p><p>Assignments are due on the date and at the time posted on LEARN. Assignments will be subjected to a 10% reduction in the acquired score for each day that they are late up to 3 days and then a value of zero will be assigned for the entire assignment. An assignment submitted even one minute after the deadline will be considered late by one day. Therefore, if you received an 80% on an assignment submitted one day late, then you would acquire a final score of 72% with the 10% penalty applied.</p><p><strong>Due dates may be altered and updated as the term progresses. Changes to the schedule will be notified to the class via the LEARN Announcements or via MS Teams as well as with an updated Syllabus posted on LEARN.</strong></p><p>A course website has been created on the learning platform “Learn” (Desire2Learn). Information on access to the website will be provided in class. Students registered in the course can access the course website after the first class by going to the LEARN website (<a href="http://learn.uwaterloo.ca">http://learn.uwaterloo.ca</a>) and logging in using your WatIAM/Quest username and password. Once logged in, you will see the course listed under “My Courses and Communities”. </p><p>The course website provides access to lecture presentations, course notes, and other relevant information. Online material in LEARN can be opened or downloaded by clicking on the appropriate link. In addition, the course website supports announcements, discussion groups and e-mail. Assignments will be handed in via the LEARN course website and students should become familiar with the website and submission process early so as not to receive a late submission.</p>
</div>
<a></a>
<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Community of Learners</strong></p><p>A goal for this course is that we shall all contribute to a climate that promotes a Community of Learners. This includes participating in an instructional environment that promotes respect, interaction, and communication. Respectful language and behaviour are expected of all students during classes and class discussions.</p><p>Please Note: In a community of learners, diversity of opinion is respected. Class discussions, group exercises, etc., should reflect respect for others’ opinions. If you anticipate an emergency during the class meeting that will require the activation of your cell phone and/or device please speak with the instructor before class. Otherwise, please respect the instructional environment that is interrupted if cell phones or devices are activated.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as analyzing spatial data, summarizing data for reporting results, or putting together statistical models. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work, describe your workflow, and demonstrate how developed code or spatial statistics work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>.

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
