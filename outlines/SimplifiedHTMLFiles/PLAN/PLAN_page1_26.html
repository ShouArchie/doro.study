  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>The course comprises lecture content and dedicated lab work on assignments. The lecture will be used to introduce the theory and concepts behind advanced GIS methods as well as to demonstrate techniques that will aid the completion of lab assignments. Significant additional time will be required for independent study to complete assignments and develop necessary skills. The schedule of course content is subject to change and likely will change as much of the course is in redevelopment. </p><p> </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Class </strong></td><td><strong>Week </strong></td><td><strong>Contents </strong></td></tr><tr><td>1 </td><td>Jan 9</td><td>Introduction and Review</td></tr><tr><td>2 </td><td>Jan 16</td><td>Suitability Analysis</td></tr><tr><td>3 </td><td>Jan 23</td><td>Multi-Colinearity</td></tr><tr><td>4 </td><td>Jan 30 </td><td>Criteria Weighting</td></tr><tr><td>5 </td><td>Feb 6</td><td>Data Cleaning and Matching</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Feb 13</td><td>Visual Scripting and Model Builder</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Feb 20</td><td><strong>Reading Week</strong></td></tr><tr><td>7 </td><td>Feb 27</td><td>Sensitivity Analysis</td></tr><tr><td>8 </td><td>Mar 6</td><td>Guest Lecture</td></tr><tr><td>9 </td><td>Mar 13</td><td>Variant/Invariant Regions</td></tr><tr><td>10 </td><td>Mar 20</td><td>Map Comparison</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Mar 27</td><td>Content and Assignment Review</td></tr><tr><td>12 </td><td>April 3</td><td>Final Test</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p> </p>

<h2>
  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>Activities for this course may involve recording, in partial fulfillment of the course learning outcomes.  You will receive notification of recording via at least one of the following mechanisms: within the Learning Management System (LEARN), a message from your course instructor, course syllabus/website, or other means. Some technologies may also provide a recording indicator. Images, audio, text/chat messaging that have been recorded may be used and/or made available by the University to course instructors, teaching assistants, and students for the purpose of materials review. Recordings will be managed according to the University records classification scheme, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/records-management/records-classification-and-retention-schedules"><u>WatClass</u></a>, and will be securely destroyed when no longer needed by the University. Your personal information is protected in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31"><u>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</u></a>, as well as <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/privacy/"><u>University policies and guidelines</u></a> and may be subject to disclosure where required by law.</p><p>The University will use reasonable means to protect the security and confidentiality of the recorded information, but cannot provide a guarantee of such due to factors beyond the University’s control, such as recordings being forwarded, copied, intercepted, circulated, disclosed, or stored without the University’s knowledge or permission or the introduction of malware into computer system which could potentially damage or disrupt the computer, networks, and security settings. The University is not responsible for connectivity/technical difficulties or loss of data associated with your hardware, software or Internet connection.</p><p>By engaging in course activities that involve recording, you are consenting to the use of your appearance, image, text/chat messaging, and voice and/or likeness in the manner and under the conditions specified herein. (In the case of a live stream event, if you choose not to have your image or audio recorded, you may <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-it-services/"><u>disable the audio and video functionality</u></a>. Instructions to participate using a pseudonym instead of your real name are included where the feature exists; however, you must disclose the pseudonym to your instructor in advance in order to facilitate class participation.) If you choose not to be recorded, this notice serves as confirmation of your understanding that you must seek an alternative arrangement with the course instructor<i>.</i>  </p><p>You are not permitted to disclose the link to/URL of an event or an event session recording or copies of recording to anyone, for any reason. Recordings are available only to authorized individuals who have been directly provided the above instructions/link for their use. Recordings for personal use, required to facilitate your learning and preparation of personal course/lecture notes, should not be shared with others without the permission of the instructor or event coordinator. Review the University’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>guidelines for faculty, staff and students entering relationships with external organizations offering access to course materials</u></a> for more information on your obligations with respect to keeping copies of course materials.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Community of Learners</strong></p><p>A goal for this course is that we shall all contribute to a climate that promotes a Community of Learners. This includes participating in an instructional environment that promotes respect, interaction, and communication. Respectful language and behaviour are expected of all students during classes and class discussions.</p><p>Please Note: In a community of learners, diversity of opinion is respected. Class discussions, group exercises, etc., should reflect respect for others’ opinions. If you anticipate an emergency during the class meeting that will require the activation of your cell phone and/or device please speak with the instructor before class. Otherwise, please respect the instructional environment that is interrupted if cell phones or devices are activated.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as analyzing spatial data, summarizing data for reporting results, or putting together statistical models. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work, describe your workflow, and demonstrate how developed code or spatial statistics work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>. The following text is recommended:<br/><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
