<div>
<div>
<div>PLAN 409:</div>
<p>This intensive urban design studio provides students with the opportunity to work collaboratively in teams to develop knowledge and experience in planning and urban design at the larger scale of a subdivision or district. Studio and field instruction emphasize the integration of ecological, cultural, economic, and policy factors that contribute to the development or redevelopment of environmentally sustainable and socially vibrant mixed-use communities. Design work and reports will be developed to professional standards for presentation to a community client or expert jury panel.</p>

<p>“…<i>we need a different city</i> … and architects and urban planners have a pioneering role to play. They must develop new perspectives and visions for urban planning that take responsibility for the most pressing questions of our time.”</p><p>From: Bürklin, T., &amp; Peterek, M. (2021). Beyond Beauty or Urban Design of Responsibility. <i>Technical Transactions</i>, <i>118</i>(1)</p><p>The Canadian Institute of Planners instructs members to practice in a manner “that respects diversity, needs, values and aspirations of the public, as well as acknowledge the inter-related nature of planning decisions and the consequences for natural and human environments.” The problem with these and other statements is they fail to unpack the pluralistic publics … <i>Words like equity and inclusion are not clearly defined in terms of their application to urban design processes … or notions of design excellence</i>.</p><p>From: Pitter, J. (2020). <i>A call to courage: an open letter to Canadian urbanists.</i> https://canurb.org/citytalk-news/a-call-tocourage-an-open-letter-to-canadian-urbanists.</p><p>All urban spaces are social constructions, and all (or most) urban designers strive for excellence in their work. However, not all are successful in achieving excellence. Urban designers and related professionals (i.e. architects, landscape architects and engineers) create the form of private and public spaces that, at times, create problems for members of civic society – i.e. racialized people, women, older adults, people with impairments, etc. These problems are often not an inherent feature of the built environment. Rather they frequently result from the choices made by professionals and decision makers responsible for managing our urban spaces, which are in turn a result of the tacit (but sometimes explicit) beliefs and attitudes about the needs of the various communities that comprise a city and society’s responsibilities towards them. Plan 409 reflects on the meaning of ‘good’ urban design, and the role that planners, landscape architects and architects play in developing creative, ‘out-of-the-box’ solutions for building cities that address the pressing urban challenges of our time. As the capstone course to the urban design specialization, students are strongly encouraged to integrate techniques and concepts that they have learned from prior urban design courses as well as other courses that they have taken broadly in the School of Planning (e.g. Planning theory).</p>

<p>Plan 409 students can access licensed graphics software that is available to all Planning students through the Geddes Lab in EV2 1002A. One expectation of the course is that students are free to choose the medium/media through which they will communicate their design ideas for the course project. Students are encouraged to approach the visual communication requirements of this course in one of two ways. First, students may choose to ‘play to their strengths.’ In other words, use the manual or digital communication techniques that they feel most comfortable or adept at using to convey their ideas. Alternatively, students may choose to ‘stretch what they know.’ In other words, if there is a digital technology or manual drawing technique that students are interested in exploring to add to their repertoire of skills, then they are encouraged to approach the course professor and discuss the technology or technique that they are interested in pursuing.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The course calendar description for Plan 409 indicates that there may be additional fees associated with taking this course (see page 1). These fees will not be charged in the Winter 2025 offering of Plan 409. There are no required textbooks for this course and students are expected to use the software that is provided in the Faculty of Environment’s computing labs to complete the graphic components of their assignments. In addition, all assignments will be submitted in digital form – i.e. assignment submissions will not be printed. <strong>As such,</strong> <strong>there is no additional ‘costing’ associated with taking Plan 409.</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the assignment deliverables listed above there is a 20% course participation grade. <strong>Participation does not mean attendance</strong>. To receive the participation grade, students must demonstrate that they are <strong>actively</strong> <strong>engaged</strong> in lecture or studio discussions, which they can do in two ways:</p><ol><li>Students will be evaluated primarily based on their engagement with the course professor during studio sessions to develop your work and understand in depth what needs to be done to produce a high-quality submission. Engagement with the course professor is an active, two-way discussion about project progress and ideas.</li><li>‘Pin-up’ critique sessions are scheduled throughout the term for students to present their work and receive constructive feedback from their peers, the course professor and TAs. Although participation in the critiques is not mandatory, students are strongly encouraged to use the sessions primarily because they are an <strong>opportunity</strong> to receive broad feedback, and participation in the pin-up sessions is considered in the final course participation assessment. </li></ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> Students who are absent from three or more classes (lectures or studios) without following the requirements under <i>Declaration of Absences</i> (below) will lose the full (20%) course participation grade. Leaving a class/studio before the scheduled completion time without notifying the course professor will count as an absence from that class/studio.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office</p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>.

However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p>
