<p>The table below provides a general overview of the weekly content alongside the associated activities and assignments. Please see the <strong>Course Schedule </strong>in LEARN for complete details and due dates.</p><figure><table><thead><tr><th><p>Week</p></th><th><p><strong>Content Topic</strong></p></th><th><p>Overview</p></th><th><p>Activities and Assessments</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th><p>Week 1</p></th><td><strong>Community Planning — The Big Picture</strong></td><td>In this inaugural session, we will review the objectives and structure of the course. We then turn to a discussion of the fundamentals about community planning. Topics to be covered include: the evolution of planning as a profession, key trends that affect planning, and the challenges posed by climate change when planning communities.</td><td><strong>Introduce Yourself</strong>: Due</td></tr><tr><th><p>Week 2</p></th><td><strong>Climate Change Fundamentals</strong></td><td>In this week’s content, we will briefly review the basics of the climate change phenomenon. This will include a discussion of trends and patterns. We then move on to the overall implications of climate change for communities and related planning challenges and responses.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><th><p>Week 3</p></th><td><strong>Operating Concepts</strong></td><td>The objective is to help communities prepare for these anticipated impacts – to be precise, to mitigate or minimize negative impacts and to maximize potential positive impacts. Before we discuss planning strategies, we need to review some key concepts and operating terms: vulnerability, resilience, mitigation and adaptation. </td><td> </td></tr><tr><th><p>Week 4</p></th><td><strong>Institutional and Governance Framework</strong></td><td>Typically, the public sector is responsible for responses to the climate change phenomenon. In this week’s content, we examine the kinds of interventions required by government in general, with attention to the roles, responsibilities and powers that are associated with local, provincial/state and federal governments.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><th rowspan="3"><p>Week 5</p></th><td rowspan="3"><strong>Planning for Climate Change — Best Practices</strong></td><td rowspan="3">We review the characteristics of what can be considered effective climate change planning. We also consider the elements of a climate change plan. This analysis is informed by best practices in the literature which includes published, community-based climate change plans; and, approaches to climate change planning applied by Canadian communities.</td><td><strong>Discussion 1</strong>: Due</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Assignment 1</strong>: Draft Submission (Turnitin)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Assignment 1</strong>: Due</td></tr><tr><th><p>Week 6</p></th><td><strong>Climate Change and the Planning Cycle</strong></td><td>Planning for climate change is a responsibility shared by all levels of government. However, since the majority of impacts will be experienced in communities and regions, communities as a whole - including local government - will need to plan for climate change (i.e., land use, spatial planning, urban design, infrastructure, etc.). In this session, we review the climate change planning process and planning cycle, noting the kind of information that is required to make informed decisions and the actors involved in the climate change planning process.</td><td><strong>Assignment 3</strong>: Meet Your Project Team Members and Create a Team Contract</td></tr><tr><th><p>Week 7</p></th><td><strong>Community Planning Tools</strong></td><td>Once a climate change plan has been developed, it needs to be implemented. At this stage, community planners can access and apply a variety of implementation tools. These can include policy tools (e.g., land use plans), statutory tools (e.g., zoning bylaws, design standards), green infrastructure, behavioural change (i.e., consumption patterns), and financial tools (e.g., incentives and/or disincentives).</td><td><strong>Assignment 3</strong>: Project Proposal</td></tr><tr><th><p>Week 8</p></th><td><strong>Climate Change Plan Implementation Strategies</strong></td><td>It is necessary, but not sufficient, to create a climate plan or strategy. To be effective and generate desired outcomes and impacts, the plan has to be implemented, and the tools must be used effectively and strategically. In this session, we consider the factors that can facilitate (or impede) successful implementation of these plans (e.g., political strategy, stakeholder support, etc.).</td><td> </td></tr><tr><th rowspan="2"><p>Week 9</p></th><td rowspan="2"><strong>Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies</strong></td><td rowspan="2"><p><i>Mitigation</i>: Communities must do what they can to temper the pace and extent of climate change. For example, how might we reduce GHG emissions through land use, building design, transportation system and infrastructure planning (e.g., mass transit, alternative travel modes)? Is it possible to reduce energy consumption, and thus the demand for coal-based fuels? How might urban tree planting projects help to cool cities? Can we increase our use of low-energy systems?</p><p><i>Adaptation</i>: Context is a critical determinant for adaptation strategies. This will require local government policies and projects that guide and control. The land use implications will include, for example, new forms of urban development (i.e., strategic intensification), infrastructure (i.e., green infrastructure), resource management strategies (i.e., water retention/drought management/flood control), and climate change appropriate urban design (i.e., vegetation plantings, low-energy building design, LEED™ standards).</p></td><td><strong>Assignment 2</strong>: Draft Submission (Turnitin)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Assignment 2</strong>: Due</td></tr><tr><th><p>Week 10</p></th><td><strong>Plan Monitoring and Evaluation</strong></td><td>Once the climate change plan is implemented, it is necessary to determine whether it has achieved the desired impacts and outcomes. The objective is to ensure the climate change plan is responsive and effective. This calls for regular monitoring and evaluation of the climate change plan. The plan monitoring and evaluation process will identify goals, objectives, policies and actions that could require reinforcement, and/or revision. This also calls for the development of indicators that provide useful information for plan monitoring and evaluation.</td><td><strong>Discussion 2</strong>: Due</td></tr><tr><th rowspan="2"><p>Week 11</p></th><td rowspan="2"><strong>Case Studies — Community Climate Change Adaptation Planning/Plans</strong></td><td rowspan="2">Communities of all kinds – urban, rural, small town, Indigenous - will be adversely affected by the impacts of climate change. In this session, we review some of the high profile and common impacts of climate change. We then examine how communities have responded to the climate change challenge. Case studies from Canada and elsewhere are reviewed in this session.</td><td><strong>Assignment 3</strong>: Team PowerPoint Presentation (Submit to Dropbox)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Assignment 3</strong>: Team PowerPoint Presentation and Class Discussion (Submit to Discussion and Participate)</td></tr><tr><th rowspan="2"><p>Week12</p></th><td rowspan="2"><strong>Climate Change Plan</strong></td><td rowspan="2">In this session, Project Teams will finalize a report that demonstrates the application of the knowledge acquired in this course to a real-world community. The product will be a climate change adaptation strategy/plan. The report will provide an overview of the dynamics of climate change, common impacts, and then, with reference to a specific community, the Team’s recommendations about a supportive planning process and policy recommendations.</td><td><strong>Assignment 3</strong>: Final Team Project Report Draft Submissions (Turnitin)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Assignment 3</strong>: Final Team Project Report</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>There is no final examination for this course.</p>

Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
