  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>PLAN 110:</div>
<p>This course explores multiple forms of visual communication and design. Students will be introduced to two and three-dimensional drawings that are relevant for urban planners and designers. Students will gain practical design skills using both hand drawing/sketching and computer software. A key component of this course is student development of a critical understanding of the role of planners as producers and consumers of visual imagery. Students will also learn and experience design as an iterative process.</p>

<div>
<h4><strong>Course Introduction</strong></h4><p>Plan 110 introduces students to the technical and conceptual skills that professional planners use in the graphic communication of planning and design concepts. The course will build skills that are fundamental to planning and design practice through a variety of representation techniques that will equip students with the ability to communicate their ideas. Through a hands-on approach, students will learn to create clear, compelling visuals that enhance their ability to communicate planning ideas, policies, and proposals to diverse audiences, including community stakeholders, government officials, and the public. Key topics include the design of site plans, diagrams, infographics and presentation panels. Practical assignments will allow students to apply these skills in real-world planning scenarios, helping to bridge the gap between technical planning knowledge and effective visual communication.</p><p>In general, the course is intended to provide a foundation in graphic communication that all planning students will require for future course (i.e. PLAN 210) and professional work. In your future careers, whether you have a direct hand in the development of planning and design graphics, the visual communication of plan information is vital to <i>all planning professionals</i>. It is therefore essential that you become familiar with the content of plan graphics and the processes that contribute to their production.</p><h4><strong>Learning Modes </strong></h4><p>This is an in-person course. Lecture slides will be shared, but lectures and studios will <i>not </i>be recorded and posted. Students are not permitted to record lectures or studios. Students who miss class are responsible for getting notes <i>from another student</i>. In the context of COVID-19, students should be prepared for changes to the course outline, schedule, and assessments in the case of a possible short-term or long-term cancellation of class, or a shift to an online learning mode, as directed by the University. When sketching on-site and doing any field-based observation, students must keep safety top-of-mind and respect the privacy of people and property.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Evaluation</strong></h4><p>There are three main course assignments for Plan 110:</p><p>The grade breakdown and due dates for each Assignment (and their components) are as follows:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td><strong>Value</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>Assignment 1: Sketching as Observation </p><p>Due: <strong>February 7th</strong></p></td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td><p>Assignment 2: Infographic &amp; Urban Design Guideline Review</p><p>Due: <strong>March 14th</strong></p></td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td><p>Assignment 3: Site Massing &amp; Presentation Panel for Public Meeting</p><p>Due: <strong>April 6th</strong></p></td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td>Studio Participation </td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td><p>In-Class Multiple Choice Quiz (2 total)</p><p><strong>January 27<sup>th</sup> &amp; March 3rd</strong></p></td><td>10%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Assignment 1:</strong> <strong>Sketching as Observation:</strong> You will choose any site in the city of Kitchener to visit, photograph, observe and sketch. You will use visual (sketch) and written communication to prepare a four-page submission in Adobe Indesign summarizing your observations. Please complete the mandatory <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/planning/form/plan-110-visual-communication-de">field trip form</a> before travelling to your chosen site. </p><p><strong>Assignment 2: Infographic &amp; Urban Design Guideline Review: </strong>Chose one section of Kitchener’s Urban Design Manual that corresponds to the site/building you have chosen in Assignment 1. Analyze how your site/buildings meet the objectives outlined in the Urban Design Manual by preparing an infographic(s) with accompanied written descriptions to visually tell the story of your site. You will use visual (infographics) and written communication to prepare a four-page submission in Adobe Indesign summarizing your urban design review. </p><p><strong>Assignment 3: Site Massing &amp; Presentation Panel for Public Meeting:</strong> Clear and effective visual communication of your planning and design work, particularly to members of the public, is an essential aspect of planning communication. Students will use SketchUp to prepare a basic massing model of their site/building. Once this is complete, students should use CAD mapper/photoshop/procreate to add basic context to the massing model (ie: landscaping, people, transportation). Using your site sketch, infographic and 3D model, students will prepare a public meeting presentation panel. Students will be introduced to layout and graphic communication principles for design information panels that could be used in a Public Meeting setting. </p><p><strong>Submitting Work</strong><br/>Assignments are to be completed and submitted on time. Digital assignments are to be submitted directly to the professor through the course Learn site. All manual assignments are to be submitted to the Teaching Assistants by the deadline during their scheduled studio session. Late assignments will be penalized at the rate of 5% per day. With the exception of extraordinary circumstances that must be discussed with the professor, no work will be accepted for grading if it is submitted more than ten days after the assignment deadline.</p><p><strong>Conduct</strong><br/>Students can expect that the course professor and teaching assistants will deliver the material/concepts according to the course syllabus, be available for office hours and Studio sessions and provide timely, respectful and constructive feedback on course assignments. If the professor or teaching assistant is not available for all or a portion of a Studio session due either to illness or is required to attend a meeting by School, Faculty or University administration, students will be notified in advance by e-mail. Students are expected to submit completed work in a timely manner, conduct themselves professionally and respectfully during on-line meetings and contribute equitably to the preparation and completion of project work. All participants in Plan 110 (professor, teaching assistants and students alike) are expected to conduct themselves ethically, respectfully and contribute to an environment that is free of harassment and discrimination.</p><p><strong>Academic Honesty</strong><br/>Originality is the cornerstone of academic as well as professional planning and design practice. To protect and uphold academic integrity in the class, it is the responsibility of the student to demonstrate the originality of his or her work if called upon to do so. When there is any doubt regarding the originality of student work, a student may be asked at any time to explain his or her work as part of the normal assignment evaluation process. Graphic assignments that are duplications or reproductions of existing work produced by another source will result in an academic penalty.</p>
</div>
<a></a>
<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4><strong>Course Policies</strong></h4><p><br/><strong>Grade Penalties and Special Considerations:</strong><br/>Papers are due on the date set. The first day a paper is late results in a -5% penalty; the submission date and time will be determined by the date stamp produced by the Turnitin system. An additional -5% penalty is assessed for each additional late day. Requests for exemptions or compassionate considerations are to be discussed with the instructor. </p><p><strong>Referencing and Citation: </strong><br/>The School of Planning uses the APA (American Psychological Association) citation style as a standard referencing system. The APA style is described in the <i>Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association </i>(call number BF76.7.P83 2001). You can find APA guidelines at: http://www.apastyle.org/ </p><p><strong>Writing and Communication Centre: </strong><br/>The Writing and Communication Centre (WCC) works with students as they develop their ideas, draft, and revise. Writing and Communication specialists offer one-on-one support in planning assignments, synthesizing and citing research, organizing papers and reports, designing presentations and e-portfolios, and revising for clarity and coherence. You can make multiple appointments throughout the term, or you can drop in at the Library for quick questions or feedback. To book a 50-minute appointment and to see drop-in hours, visit www.uwaterloo.ca/wcc. Group appointments for team-based projects, presentations, and papers are also available. <strong>Please note </strong>that communication specialists guide you to see your work as readers would. They can teach you revising skills and strategies, but will not change or correct your work for you. </p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>.

After that time, they will be destroyed in compliance with UW’s confidential shredding procedures. </p><p><strong>Research Ethics:</strong> The University of Waterloo requires all research conducted by its students, staff, and faculty which involves humans as participants to undergo prior ethics review and clearance through the Director, Office of Human Research and Animal Care (Office). The ethics review and clearance processes are intended to ensure that projects comply with the Office’s Guidelines for Research with Human Participants (Guidelines) as well as those of provincial and federal agencies, and that the safety, rights and welfare of participants are adequately protected. The Guidelines inform researchers about ethical issues and procedures which are of concern when conducting research with humans (e.g. confidentiality, risks and benefits, informed consent process, etc.). If the development of your research proposal consists of research that involves humans as participants, the please contact the course instructor for guidance and see: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics</u></a></p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.
