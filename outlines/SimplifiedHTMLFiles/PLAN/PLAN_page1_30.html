<h3><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></h3><p>This course will focus on specific areas of professional planning practice through lectures, guest speakers and in-class discussions. There will be a strong emphasis on planning practice in today’s policy and political climate, drawing on real life contexts, challenges, situations and events. The Instructor has worked in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors over the last 25+ years and has led a municipal planning department and also been a partner and senior practitioner in private practice. The course will be focused on skills and knowledge needed in professional practice for a newly graduated planner.</p>

<h3><strong><u>Learning Modes</u></strong></h3><p>The classroom will be the primary learning venue for the course with the written assignments building on the in-class lectures and discussions.</p><p>There are two written assignments required in the course. Each will be provided at minimum two weeks in advance of the due date. The first is an individual assignment and the second will be assigned to groups. There will be group presentations for the second assignment. There will also be a series of in-class assignments, both individual and group, to be completed in-class.</p><p>This course builds heavily from the class lectures and discussion with the instructor and guest lecturers. Lectures will be presented primarily from a practitioner’s perspective and may be unique from previous academic learnings. The rate at which new information, concepts and perspectives are presented will happen faster than previously experienced in other courses. Therefore, it is essential that students keep up-to-date and attend all classes and participate in the class discussion to clarify their understanding.</p><p>For the assignments to be true learning experiences where students build relevant and applicable planning skills, the assignments have been developed to parallel “real life” issues and scenarios and will be challenging in thought and time. It will not be possible to do the assignments adequately at the last minute, or draw heavily from work from previous courses.</p><p>Computer work is part of the assignments. Students are expected to have already developed appropriate skills in Microsoft Word. Instruction and consulting regarding the use of these computer skills is not provided in this course.</p>

The exercise will presume that the building has not yet been built, and is still a development proposal, and the Urban Design Brief will be part of the development application package. The brief will be a minimum of 500 words and a maximum of 750 words and will draw upon lessons learned about Planning for Design Excellence in Week 3. The assignment is due February 3, 2025, at 4 pm, and is to be submitted digitally. An overview of the assignment and the Urban Design Brief Guidelines will be presented during the January 20 class.</p><p><strong><u>Assignment #2 (Group) – Writing Planning Policy for Collaborative City-Building:</u></strong></p><p>Students will work in twelve groups of eight to prepare a policy document for the downtown of a mid-sized Ontario city that addresses each of the five themes explored in the guest lectures:</p><ul><li>Planning for Design Excellence</li><li>Planning for Joy</li><li>Planning for Urban Greenspace</li><li>Planning for Decarbonization</li><li>Planning for Sustainable Mobility</li></ul><p>For the written assignment, students will prepare a chapter of a planning document for each of the five themes that includes:</p><ul><li>Goal / Vision Statement (approx. 200 words)</li><li>Policy Objectives (5 to 10)</li><li>Planning Policies (5 to 10)</li></ul><p>For each theme, students will also provide a 300 to 500 word explanation of their rationale, drawing upon the information and discussion from each of the guest lectures. The written assignment is due March 17, 2025, at 4 pm, and is to be submitted digitally.</p><p>For the group presentation, students will select one theme and provide a 15-minute presentation on their goals and vision statement, policy objectives and planning policies and how they believe their approach would address the theme. Presentations will take place March 17, 24, and 31 and will be 15 minutes followed by 10 minutes for Q+A. Students will be assigned a group presentation time and will be required to participate in the presentations by other students during that time slot. </p><p>Part of the group marking will involve the evaluation of group members.</p><p><strong><u>In-Class Assignments:</u></strong></p><p>Small assignments will be completed in-class in Weeks 4, 6 and 8. Each assignment will be based on the day’s lecture and is expected to take approximately 30 minutes. Assignments must be submitted at the end of the class.</p><p><strong><u>Student Evaluation:</u></strong></p><p>Students will be graded on the basis of the marks on their assignments as well as in-class participation. The final grade will be calculated as follows:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Course Component</strong></p><p> </p></td><td><p><strong>Percentage / Mark Weighting</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Due Date</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Assignment #1 – Preparation of an Urban Design Brief (Individual)</p><p> </p></td><td><p>25%</p></td><td><p>February 3 at 4 pm</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Assignment #2 – Writing Planning Policy for Collaborative City-Building (Group)</p><p> </p></td><td><p>Group Written Report 25%</p><p> </p><p>Group Presentation 15%</p><p> </p><p>Individual Peer Evaluation 5%</p><p> </p></td><td><p>Written Report March 17 at 4 pm</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>In-Class Assignment – Planning for Joy</p><p> </p></td><td><p>7.5%</p></td><td><p>January 27 at end of class</p></td></tr><tr><td>In-Class Assignment – Planning for Decarbonization</td><td><p>7.5%</p></td><td><p>February 10 at end of class</p></td></tr><tr><td>In-Class Assignment – Planning for Sustainable Mobility</td><td><p>7.5%</p></td><td><p>February 24 at end of class</p></td></tr><tr><td>In-Class Engagement and Participation </td><td><p>7.5%</p></td><td><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong><u>Requirements, Grade Penalties and Special Considerations:</u></strong></p><p>Readability and Clarity – Students are expected to present well organized and properly written work. </p><p>Computer Use – Assignments must be completed by using a computer. Assignments may not be accepted if a computer is not used.</p><p>Lateness Penalty – All assignments are due on the date set out by the Instructor. Teaching Assistants are not permitted to change the due dates. The first day an assignment is late brings about a 5% penalty. An additional 5% is assessed for each additional late day. A student’s assignment more than 4 business days late will not be accepted and a grade of zero will be recorded for that assignment.</p><p>Requests for Extensions, Exemptions or Compassionate Considerations – Requests are to be discussed with the Instructor in advance or as soon as possible.</p><p>Exceptions to the above may be made for students registered with AccessAbility.</p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as <strong>[fill this in with your discipline-specific skills]</strong>. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
