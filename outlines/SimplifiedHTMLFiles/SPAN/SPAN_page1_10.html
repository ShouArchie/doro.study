<p>This course further promotes students’ oral and written abilities, as well as their critical understanding of the history and culture of the Spanish-speaking regions. Course components include written and oral/aural practice of Spanish through oral reports, class discussions and debates on assigned topics, short literary works, and films. It offers a review of some of the most challenging grammatical structures with the aim of achieving greater accuracy. Methodology: As in SPAN 301A, this course will also be conducted entirely in Spanish through oral, writing and listening comprehension exercises in LEC and TUT classes. The content and activities covered are meant to be relevant to real-life situations. Students are encouraged to share their own experiences and knowledge. This is a highly interactive course and, therefore, students are expected to work individually and in groups. Punctuality, attendance and participation are expected. Performance will also be assessed through compositions, discussions, and a final project chosen by students according to their interests and strengths. Appears as held with SPAN 210, counts as either SPAN 210 or 301B, not both.</p>

<p><strong>Participation (20%):</strong> There are two components to this part of the evaluation: <strong>(1) your</strong> <strong>general participation</strong> in every class (<strong>12%</strong>), for which students must <strong>complete online homework and assigned readings</strong> in order to be able to <strong>participate</strong> <strong>fully</strong> in discussions, debates, group work, and in-class activities. Based on a per-class basis, participation is measured by the Instructor in a four-point notation: <strong>0</strong> = absence; <strong>1</strong> = only attendance without participation; <strong>2</strong> = regular involvement; <strong>3</strong> = continuous participation; <strong>4</strong> = proactive and consistent involvement. The other component is <strong>(2)</strong> <strong>your specific participation leading a class discussion </strong>(<strong>8%</strong>), for which you must prepare beforehand an assigned topic, present a summary to the class, and direct a discussion by answering questions and promoting conversation and debate; <strong>dates to be decided during the first week of classes</strong>. Remember that the class is for you to practice <strong>speaking and listening Spanish</strong>, among other abilities. You must be present in class in order to earn this part of the evaluation. For both participation components, do not ad-lib any participation related to assigned activities, readings and/or exercises; avoid excessive use of electronics in class; and be honest if you are not prepared. There are few classes and short class times. Therefore, no single participation will be counted more than once, i.e. there are no make-up activities. Please note that astral projection or distance participation is not allowed. For any issues regarding attendance or assignment submission, please refer to: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances</a>  <strong>ATTENTION</strong>: Do not send any excuse or verification of illness to the Instructor. Only notes from the Absence Database will be accepted.</p><p><strong>Online Homework (15%):</strong> Your textbook, <i>Revista</i> 6<sup>th</sup> edition, brings with it a code to access the online component of our course at Vista Higher Learning (vhlcentral.com); note that this code is the one we used in SPAN 301A during the past fall term. With that code, you will have to log in and register for our course “<strong>SPAN 301B Winter 2025</strong>” in section “<strong>SPAN301B LEC 001</strong>.” Every week there will be exercises assigned as “Homework” so that you advance in the learning and application of your Spanish language knowledge. “Homework” exercises will prepare you for LEC &amp; TUT participation, carry a mark and include vocabulary, grammar and cultural aspects. “Homework” exercises are marked over 100%, and overdue submissions are penalized at a rate of 05% per day. There will also be activities for “Preparation” which, together with other in-class activities (e.g., taller de escritura), do not carry a mark as they are for you to solidify your Spanish knowledge and be prepared for classes, and are a for-credit component that, at the discretion of the Instructor, could help boost marks in case someone needs support to get to a higher grade (say, from 79 to 80). There will be a time limit and a due date for all activities/exercises, and you will have two attempts at doing them.</p><p><strong>Compositions (2 x 7½ % = 15%):</strong> There will be two take-home compositions of approximately two pages in length to be uploaded to a LEARN dropbox. Please upload only MS Word documents (file extension .docx) using the following format: letter size page, one-inch margins all around, <u>double space</u>, Times News Roman 12 pt. Both file extension and format make marking easier and provide space for more comments and observations; if the submitted document is in any other format or has a different extension (e.g., .pdf), it will have a 10% penalization. Compositions are related to class topics, lexicon and grammar studied, with the added challenge of using some required grammatical concepts and terminology so that students can practice the language concepts learned, and freely express their opinions as practiced during discussions. Students will receive instructions no less than seven (07) days prior to hand in their compositions. Compositions will be marked over 100%, and overdue submissions are penalized at a rate of 05% per day (always check the closing date of a LEARN dropbox as it is usually [not always] later than the due date). Important dates related to this evaluation component are indicated in the Course Outline and will be announced in class.</p><p><strong>Online Grammar Tests (3 x 6⅔% = 20%):</strong> Since we do not have much time to spare in class, we will have three online tests related to the grammatical structures studied in each textbook chapter. Each test will be at the end of a textbook lesson, as indicated in the Course Outline. These tests will include both the grammar content in the textbook and the additional grammar material provided via LEARN. Given the difficulty of the grammar content in this course, these online grammar tests will be more challenging than those in SPAN 301A. The best preparation is to review grammar content, do homework, participate in class, ask questions and attend conversation labs. There will be a time limit for every grammar test, and you will have one attempt at completing them. Tests will be available for a period of 36 hours between Wednesday 8:00 AM and Thursday 8:00 PM. Students must complete the three grammar tests on time as there will be no make-up tests for any reason. If you miss a test for whatever circumstances, even if you present a valid absence through the Absence Database, you must suggest a suitable solution to your missing test situation: no solution suggested, no consideration granted. All suggestions will be taken into careful consideration. However, the Instructor reserves the right to decide on the most appropriate means to substitute the mark for the missing test.</p><p><strong>Conversation Tutorials (attendance 05% + participation 10% = 15%):</strong> In addition to LEC classes, students will have a 50-min conversation Tutorial (TUT) every week for ten weeks, starting on the second week of classes. This is an integral component of the course as students will have more opportunities to practice their Spanish through oral expression and listening comprehension activities. All of these activities are taken from the textbook so that we make a better use of its content, specially now that our class time is shorter. Students will also receive help in the preparation of other evaluation components such as directing discussions, compositions, test practicing, and/or final project. Attendance and participation rules for LEC classes also apply to TUT classes. Students must afford the Tutorial Leader the same deference as other university instructors. The Instructor will notify the Tutorial Leader whenever a notification of an absence from the Absence Database has been received. Please do not send any excuse or verification of illness to the Tutorial Leader. Only notes from the Absence Database will be accepted.</p><p><strong>Final Project (15%):</strong> There is no final examination in SPAN 301A, only a final project that is to be completed throughout the term up to the last day of classes. This evaluation component takes into account the fact that every person learns in different ways, and is stronger in some areas, and not so strong in others. Therefore, every person can show his/her academic progress in diverse manners. Students will choose a final project based on their interests and strengths. Final projects can be selected from the following:</p><ul><li>A written informative article in Spanish (typed)</li><li>A digital story in Spanish (videorecorded)</li><li>A supervised first- or second-year grammar class -bilingual or only in Spanish- (performed)</li></ul><p><strong>Instructions</strong> for each modality will be <strong>available in LEARN</strong> as of the <strong>first week of classes</strong>. Students are encouraged, albeit not required, to choose a project modality different from the one they chose in SPAN 301A. Students will <strong>choose final project modality</strong> by the <strong>second week</strong> of classes; this will allow for <strong>at least ten weeks to complete</strong> final projects. <strong>Supervised grammar classes will happen outside SPAN 301B class time and during the last month of the term.</strong> Other final projects will be uploaded to LEARN dropboxes during the final week of classes.</p><p><i><strong>REMEMBER: GRADES ARE EARNED, NOT ASSIGNED</strong></i></p>

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p><strong>Held-with courses:</strong> Please note that a held-with course will only count in the average for the subject code under which it has been taken, unless it is cross-listed with the subject code of its’ held-with course. For example, if a CLAS/HIST held-with course is taken under the CLAS subject code then it will count only in the CLAS major average, not the HIST major average. A held-with course will also only count towards program and breadth requirements of the subject code under which it is taken, unless it is cross-listed with the subject code of its’ held-with course.</p><h2>Course Policies</h2><h2>Attendance Policy</h2><p>Students are expected to come to class on time and participate in every individual and group activity. As we all must work together, discrimination and harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. Punctuality is expected as late comers interrupt classes and usually take time to integrate to activities. Three late arrivals will constitute one absence. Working on non-course-related activities is considered an absence. Any absence equals less participation. As previously explained, do not send any excuse or verification of illness to the Instructor. Only notes from the Absence Database will be accepted.</p><h2>Late Work </h2><p>No late work will be accepted, unless a documented excuse for legal or medical reasons is presented through the Absence Database. Do not send any excuse or verification of illness to the Instructor. Once again, only notes from the Absence Database will be accepted. Students are responsible for their own Internet connection in order to download and upload ON TIME the required homework and assessments from/to content and/or dropboxes in LEARN. Assignments must follow the required formats published in this syllabus and in LEARN.</p><h2>Information on Plagiarism and Academic Offences</h2><p>Students are expected to present their own work for any evaluation component, especially for written assignments. Any assignment and homework done in and out of class is subject to scrutiny for plagiarism by the Instructor. Cheating is an unacceptable practice. Students must avoid committing this type of academic offence during evaluations. See below for information on, and ways to avoid, Academic Offences. Once again, discrimination and harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.</p><h2>Electronic Device Policy</h2><p>Students are allowed to use electronic devices only for course-related activities (e.g. accessing the <i>Supersite</i>, online dictionaries, websites relevant to in-class work, online newspapers). It is apparent when a student is constantly accessing social media or working on assignments for other courses. Please, refrain from doing this as anyone doing something other than class work in their electronic devices will be deemed absent and not participating. All electronic devices are subject to scrutiny at the discretion of the Instructor.</p><h2>Course Communications Policy</h2><p><strong>Office hours &amp; appointments:</strong> I will be available during office hours by previously arranged appointment via email. Office hours in-person appointments will happen in my office (ML 320). I expect you to treat me with respect, as I will treat you, during office hours; no abusive behaviour will be tolerated. I insist that you must make an appointment via email so that I can set aside a block of time for you during office hours, especially if you want to talk in private. First request for a meeting, first served. If you do not make any previous arrangement to meet me, appointments take priority. I might still be available during my office hours, but I might be busy with someone or something else. You are welcome to wait until I can meet you once I finish with other students. If there are no appointments during office hours, then first request via email, first served. Please, make your consultations clearly &amp; succinctly so that I can help you better. While office hours are the preferred time to meet you, sometimes it is not possible for different circumstances. If you cannot meet me during office hours, you are welcome to make an appointment via email to meet me via MS Teams videoconference during any weekday afternoon if I am available. I am positive we can always find a time suitable for you &amp; me for a virtual meeting outside office hours. Please, show on time for your appointments as you might be taking the time for other students. If you do not show within five minutes of your appointment, I will take care of other matters.</p><p><strong>Email:</strong> Please note that electronic communications will be done via University of Waterloo email (@uwaterloo.ca), or any other <u>institutional email</u>. Please, make sure that you redirect your uwaterloo.ca email to your <u>institutional email</u> (attention visitors from other universities), &amp; let me know your <u>institutional email address</u> (for example, QdelaMancha@wlu.ca). Avoid personal email addresses (such as gmail, hotmail, yahoo, &amp; the like). I expect you to treat me with respect, as I will treat you, in our email exchanges; no abusive behaviour will be tolerated. You are advised to follow the minimum email communications politeness: A <strong>greeting</strong> (please do not use “hey”, “S’up” or the like), <strong>state your business clearly &amp; succinctly</strong> (long convoluted messages are hard to answer), <strong>use magical words</strong> like “please” &amp; “thank you,” &amp; <strong>identify yourself (sign with your name &amp; student number)</strong> at the end of your message (<strong>if there is no signature, there is no response</strong>). Email messages will be dealt with in a timely manner during my regular work hours. Under no circumstances will term work be accepted if submitted via e-mail, unless arrangements for such submission have been made.</p><h2>Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence NOT Allowed</h2><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as synthesizing and analyzing information, and research presentation in a written format with a high degree of personal creativity and critical thinking. Therefore, the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is <strong>NOT</strong> permitted in this course. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><strong>Policy 71</strong></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance; <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71</a>). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p><strong>You should be prepared to show your work</strong>. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should <strong>be aware</strong> that the <strong>legal/copyright status</strong> of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.
