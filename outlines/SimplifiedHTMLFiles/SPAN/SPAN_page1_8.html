  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>SPAN 201B:</div>
<p>The course continues development of intermediate skills in reading, writing, speaking, and listening. The primary goals of the course are the further enhancement of communicative competence, and social and cultural awareness. Particular attention is placed on the use of the subjunctive mood.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>For students with low-intermediate knowledge of Spanish, SPAN 201B builds upon the knowledge acquired in SPAN 201A, and seeks to reinforce the language, both oral and written, through selected texts and grammar review. Conversation classes are also used to increase understanding and speaking skills.</p><p>Conversation sessions or tutorials are also used to increase understanding and speaking skills, and application of grammatical structures learned this term.</p><p>This is a blended course, which means students have one hour per week to prepare before we meet in person once a week for 1 hour and 50 min lecture. In addition students are <strong>required</strong> to attend a 50-min tutorial once per week, according to their schedule.</p><p>The Department of Spanish and Latin American Studies reserves the right to refuse admission to and/or credit for, any of its language courses to a student who has, in the view of the Department, a level of competence unsuited to that course.</p>

<p><strong>Course Methodology:</strong> SPAN 201B meets with the instructor for one hour and 50 minutes a week (LEC) on Tuesdays, and with the Tutorial Leader in the Conversation Tutorial for 50 min a week on either Mondays (TUT 101) or Thursdays (TUT 102). Given the fact that students and Instructor/Tutorial Leader will have limited class time, the instructor will assign students several activities to prepare before lecture/tutorial (besides the online homework and practice exercises). This way there are better opportunities to get high participation marks and little time is wasted in lecture/tutorial. These will appear under “Preparation” in the online component, to be completed by Monday at 11:59 PM (one minute to midnight). “Preparation” is a for-credit component. Students are responsible for completing those activities and come prepared to ask and answer questions, do grammar exercises, take part in debates, hold discussions in small and large groups, among other activities. It’s impossible to take advantage of everything our textbook offers, but it’s the Instructor’s aim to make use of the textbook as much as possible. For that reason, we will be using textbook content and activities in both the Lectures and the Tutorials. Both tutorial groups will also cover the same weekly activities. Any unforeseen situation, not contemplated in this syllabus, will be dealt in a timely manner in consultation with students. If any student/s has/have any concerns, please talk to the Instructor either individually or as a group.</p>

<p><strong>Participation (15%)</strong>: Class participation is of utmost importance in a language course with limited class time. You should take advantage of that time to speak in Spanish about the language and the Hispanic culture. To do this, you must continually complete homework (readings and exercises) so that you are knowledgeable about the topic/s we are covering in each class. This participation involves a number of variables, including but not limited to: Your willingness to participate actively in all class activities; your use of Spanish in the classroom; your cooperation during group and pair work; your respect and attitude toward the class and your peers; your daily preparation for each class; written homework that might be collected and graded form part of your participation grade. Your instructor reserves the right to administer pop quizzes in order to assess students’ preparation. These marks also form part of your participation grade. On a per-class basis, participation is measured by the Instructor in a four-point notation: 0 = absence; 1 = only attendance without participation;2 = regular involvement; 3 = continuous participation; 4 = proactive and consistent involvement.</p><p><strong>Tutorial or Conversation Class (Attendance 05% + Participation 10% = 15%)</strong>: There will be a 50-minute tutorial/conversation class during the week. Conversation classes will begin the second week of the term. Attendance to both the lecture and conversation class is mandatory for successful completion of the course. For this conversation class, attendance is worth 05%, active participation is worth 10%; the above variables for participation also apply to the conversation class. Note that the grade is calculated as follows: 1) There are 10 conversation tutorials / 5% = 0.5% per attendance. Make sure to sign the attendance sheet; it’s the only proof of your attendance! 2) Participation (01%/tutorial) is graded holistically—If the student is present, participates, asks questions, appears to be engaged, etc., then he/she gets a good participation mark. Please note that the attendance mark (5%) and the participation mark (10%) go hand in hand. If you miss more than five (05) conversation labs out of 10, your participation mark will not be higher than 7.5/15. Be prepared by doing preparation work beforehand!</p><p><strong>Online Homework (20%)</strong>: Your textbook, <i>Imagina</i> 5<sup>th</sup> edition, brings with it a code to access the online component of our course at Vista Higher Learning (vhlcentral.com); note that you used this code in SPAN 201A during the last term. With that code, you will have to log in and register for our course “SPAN 201B Winter 2025” in the only section named “SAPN201B LEC 001”. Every week there will be exercises assigned as “Homework” so that you advance in the learning and application of your Spanish language knowledge. “Homework” exercises carry a mark and will be due on Mondays at 11:59 PM (one minute to midnight). These exercises will prepare you for tests and include vocabulary, grammar and cultural aspects. There is another section called “Preparation” which do not carry a mark but will help you to understand better the topics studied and have a more knowledgeable participation. There will also be extra exercises called “Practice” which do not carry a mark, are on current or previously learned grammatical points and are due on Wednesdays at 11:59 PM (one minute to midnight). (“Practice” is a for-credit component that could help boost marks in case someone needs support to get to a higher grade, say from a 79 to an 80). It is up to you to do these “Practice” exercises, but it is a great idea to do them so that you solidify your previously and currently acquired Spanish. There will be a time limit and a due date for all exercises, and you will have two attempts at doing them.</p><p><strong>Online Quizzes (02 quizzes x 7.5% pts. each = 15%)</strong>: There will be two online quizzes, each one covering two lessons of the textbook: the first one covering lessons 06 and 07 at the end of lesson 07 during week 05; and the second one covering lessons 08 and 09 at the end of lesson 09 during week 09. Tests will be available for a period of 72 hours between Wednesday 12:00 PM (noon) and Saturday 12:00 PM (noon). See exact dates in the course outline. These tests will be done online since we do not have much time to spare in class. Online tests assess your learning in SPAN 201B, especially vocabulary and grammar, covering listening, writing and reading, in different question formats: matching, true or false, multiple choice, fill in the blank, short answers, compositions. While cultural aspects included in each lesson are not part of these tests, they will be intertwined in the different exercises. There will be a time limit for all online tests (according to length), and you will have one attempt at completing them within the 72 hours they will be available. Please, do not wait until the last minute to do your online tests!</p><p><strong>Communication Assignments (02 assignments x 07.5% each = 15%)</strong>: These assignments include a written composition and an individual conversation with the Instructor (10 min). For the first one, you will write a composition of no less than 350 words to demonstrate your ability to express yourself in writing. This is a take-home composition whose topic and instructions (knowledge to apply) will be given at least seven (07) days prior to submission. Compositions will be assessed on a) quality and development of ideas (20%); b) organization (20%); c) style of writing (flow) (20%); and d) written language mechanics (grammar and syntax) (40%). Compositions will happen before reading week. For individual conversations, a topic related to any aspect of the Hispanic culture must be chosen and presented in Spanish to the instructor who will definitely ask questions. Ideas can be found in previous knowledge or in the “PARA EMPEZAR”, “CORTOMETRAJE”, “IMAGINA”, “CULTURA” and “LITERATURA” sections of the textbook. Individual conversations will be assessed on a) content according to specifications (20% of mark); b) comprehension: your understanding of spoken Spanish (20%); c) comprehensibility: others understanding when you speak Spanish (20%); d) accuracy: correct language use in grammar/word order (20%); and e) fluency: clarity and decisiveness in pronunciation and intonation (20%). These assignments are meant to give you practice in the art of written and oral communications in Spanish. Remember that we all want you to do well, so this should be viewed as an opportunity to “show off” your skills, not as a source of unnecessary stress! Individual assignments can happen any time after reading week and before the last week of classes. It is the students’ responsibility to make an appointment with the instructor and notify him of the chosen topic. Further instructions will be provided in a timely manner. Remember: Don’t stress out and have a lot of fun doing these communication assignments!</p><p><strong>Final exam (20%)</strong>: This exam will be online during the final exam period. It will test grammar from all the lessons covered in the course. Although no vocabulary or cultural sections will be included, both vocabulary and culture will appear somehow in the different exam sections. There will be a time limit for the final exam, and you will have one attempt at completing it within a 72-hour period. Any potential conflicts will be dealt in a timely manner. See course program for dates.</p><p><i><strong>REMEMBER: GRADES ARE EARNED, NOT ASSIGNED</strong></i></p>

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h2>Course Policies</h2><h2>Attendance Policy</h2><p>Students are expected to come to class on time and participate in every individual and group activity. As we all must work together, discrimination and harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. Punctuality is expected as late comers interrupt classes and usually take time to integrate to activities. Three late arrivals will constitute one absence. Working on non-course-related activities is considered an absence. Any absence equals less participation.</p><h2>Late Work </h2><p>No late work will be accepted, unless a documented excuse for legal or medical reasons is presented through the Absence Database. Do not send any excuse or verification of illness to the Instructor. Once again, only notes from the Absence Database will be accepted. Students are responsible for their own Internet connection in order to download and upload ON TIME the required homework and assessments from/to content and/or dropboxes in LEARN. Assignments must follow the required formats published in this syllabus and in LEARN.</p><h2>Information on Plagiarism and Academic Offences</h2><p>Students are expected to present their own work for any evaluation component, especially for written assignments. Any assignment and homework done in and out of class is subject to scrutiny for plagiarism by the Instructor. Cheating is an unacceptable practice. Students must avoid committing this type of academic offence during evaluations. See below for information on, and ways to avoid, Academic Offences. Once again, discrimination and harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.</p><h2>Electronic Device Policy</h2><p>Students are allowed to use electronic devices only for course-related activities (e.g. accessing the <i>Supersite</i>, online dictionaries, websites relevant to in-class work, online newspapers). It is apparent when a student is constantly accessing social media or working on assignments for other courses. Please, refrain from doing this as anyone doing something other than class work in their electronic devices will be deemed absent and not participating. All electronic devices are subject to scrutiny at the discretion of the Instructor.</p><h2>Course Communications Policy</h2><p><strong>Office hours &amp; appointments:</strong> I will be available during office hours by previously arranged appointment via email. Office hours in-person appointments will happen in my office (ML 320). I expect you to treat me with respect, as I will treat you, during office hours; no abusive behaviour will be tolerated. I insist that you have to make an appointment via email so that I can set aside a block of time for you during office hours, especially if you want to talk in private. First request, first served. If you do not make any previous arrangement to meet me, appointments take priority. I might still be available during my office hours, but I might be busy with someone or something else. You are welcome to wait until I can meet you once I finish with other students. If there are no appointments during office hours, then first request via email, first served. Please, make your consultations clearly &amp; succinctly so that I can help you better. While office hours are the preferred time to meet you, sometimes it is not possible for different circumstances. If you cannot meet me during office hours, you are welcome to make an appointment via email to meet me via MS Teams videoconference during any weekday afternoon if I am available. I am positive we can always find a time suitable for you &amp; me for a virtual meeting outside office hours. Please, show on time for your appointments as you might be taking the time for other students. If you do not show within five minutes of your appointment, I will take care of other matters.</p><p><strong>Email:</strong> Please note that electronic communications will be done via University of Waterloo email (@uwaterloo.ca), or any other <u>institutional email</u>. Please, make sure that you redirect your uwaterloo.ca email to your <u>institutional email</u> (attention visitors from other universities), &amp; let me know your <u>institutional email address</u> (for example, QdelaMancha@wlu.ca). Avoid personal email addresses (such as gmail, hotmail, yahoo, &amp; the like). I expect you to treat me with respect, as I will treat you, in our email exchanges; no abusive behaviour will be tolerated. You are advised to follow the minimum email communications politeness: A greeting (please do not use “hey”, “S’up” or the like), state your business clearly &amp; succinctly (long convoluted messages are hard to answer), use magical words like “please” &amp; “thank you,” &amp; identify yourself (sign with your name &amp; student number) at the end of your message (if there is no signature, there is no response). Email messages will be dealt with in a timely manner during my regular work hours. Under no circumstances will term work be accepted if submitted via e-mail, unless arrangements for such submission have been made.</p><h2>Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence NOT Allowed</h2><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as synthesizing and analyzing information, and research presentation in a written format with a high degree of personal creativity and critical thinking. Therefore, the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is NOT permitted in this course. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance; <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71</a>). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</a> Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources">Student Success Office</a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students">Writing and Communication Centre</a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students">AccessAbility Services</a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide">Library</a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.

Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason.
