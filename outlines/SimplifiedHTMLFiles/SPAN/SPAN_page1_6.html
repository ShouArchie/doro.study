<p><strong>Welcome to Spanish 102! ¡Bienvenidos a la clase de Español 102!</strong> I am so pleased to see you continuing with your voyage which began way back in Spanish 101! Are you not amazed at how much you have learned? Do you not feel a sense of pride when you look back and consider how far you have come? — Well, you should!! For those of you who have come back from the Spanish 101 course, I am certain you are eager to continue your online learning adventure. For those who have just joined us, welcome, and prepare to become involved in the exciting adventure and meeting your online helper: ¡"<i>Profesor Pedro </i>"!!</p><p>As you already know, Spanish is one of the principal languages of the world and is one of the official languages of the United Nations. Canada's relations with the Spanish speaking countries are steadily growing and with NAFTA, new career opportunities are constantly being born for those who have a working knowledge of this beautiful tongue. Indeed, your soon to be acquired expertise in all things Hispanic will open many doors to you. A great deal of social science and humanistic research is presently being done in Latin America, as the industrialized nations are now focusing their interests on development.</p><p>To begin the study of a new language is to embark on a challenging voyage. Knowledge of another language such as French or Italian may be of some help but regardless of your other linguistic skills, you must be prepared to dedicate a significant amount of time to the preparation and completion of each of your assignments. Language study requires self-discipline and orderly work habits. <strong>"A bit everyday works better than a lot once in a while."</strong> On-campus students have three hours of lecture time per week, plus one hour in the language lab, plus their own personal homework time. So organize your time for this course accordingly. Demands on your time will be made, but you need not worry — this course will also bring you many rewards! And you might even continue to have a little fun!!</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Course Policies</h3><h4>Late Assignments</h4><p>If an exceptional situation should arise and you are unable to submit an assignment by the date specified in the <strong>Course Schedule</strong>, you must contact the instructor soon as you can. NO LATE WORK will be accepted without previous permission. Furthermore, <strong>a penalty of 1% per day late will apply in all circumstances</strong>.</p><p><strong>I do stress, however, that extensions will be permitted only in the event of serious (emergency) circumstances, and then the late assignment penalty (-1% per day) WILL still apply. Assignment due dates are being provided at the beginning of the course to facilitate your schedule organization. Remember to start doing your assignments promptly. Allow 5-6 hours per week to work through the course.</strong></p><h4>Use of external resources</h4><p>In lesson quizzes (pruebas), we <strong>strongly</strong> encourage the use of the grammatical structures and vocabulary covered in the textbook (Supersite). <strong>All assessments</strong> submitted must reflect the student´s ability to use and understand the material covered in class. The use of vocabulary, tenses and grammatical structures different from those discussed in class will be interpreted as evidence of previous knowledge of the language and/or the use of unauthorized outside help (which may include help from other students, teachers, private tutors, ghost writers, native speakers, family members) either in the preparation of assignments or in checking for errors before assignments are submitted.</p><h4>Plagiarism</h4><p>The use of online translators (such as Google Translate) is not permitted. The only allowable resource is the textbook. If in doubt, check with your instructor. For more information on Course policy on plagiarism, please refer to UW´s <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=976229&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=uWaterloo-429098">University Policies</a>, in particular <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 - Student Discipline</a>.</p><h3>University of Waterloo Department of Spanish and Latin American Studies</h3><ul><li>Dr. Monica Leoni, Chair, <a href="mailto:mleoni@uwaterloo.ca">mleoni@uwaterloo.ca</a></li><li>Dr. David Rozotto, Language Coordinator, <a href="mailto:drozotto@uwaterloo.ca">drozotto@uwaterloo.ca</a></li><li>Dr. Mario Boido, Undergraduate Advisor, <a href="mailto:mboido@uwaterloo.ca">mboido@uwaterloo.ca</a></li><li>Kira Youngblut, <a href="mailto:slas@uwaterloo.ca">slas@uwaterloo.ca</a></li></ul><h4>Why Study a Language and its Culture?</h4><ul><li>it boosts your smarts,</li><li>it makes you independent as a thinker,</li><li>it provides you with cultural awareness and competence, and</li><li>it turns you into a global citizen.</li></ul><h4>Why Spanish?</h4><ul><li>Spanish is spoken by over 425 million people</li><li>3<sup>rd</sup> most common language in the world (almost 2<sup>nd</sup>)</li><li>5<sup>th</sup> most common language spoken in Toronto and in Canada!!!</li></ul><h4>Spanish for My Future?</h4><ul><li>Ideal foundation for work in various areas</li><li>Qualified bilingual grads in demand<ul><li>national and international law</li><li>business and finance / international commerce</li><li>media</li><li>social services</li><li>medicine</li><li>education</li><li>hospitality</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Spanish and the University of Waterloo</h4><ul><li>wide range of courses – language, literature, linguistics, translation</li><li>upper year courses offered in conjunction with Wilfrid Laurier University</li><li>recent external review team found UWaterloo program to be among strongest undergraduate in the country</li><li>specializations and sub-specializations in Spanish language and cultures</li><li>double major in Spanish and another subject offered at UWaterloo</li><li>Spanish is a suitable match with any career in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Natural and Physical Sciences</li><li>as a specialization, double major, or minor, Spanish is a natural match with Humanities, Social Sciences, and also with Natural and Physical Sciences</li></ul><h4>Possibilities at the University of Waterloo</h4><ul><li>Courses offer a wide range of topics in<ul><li>Spanish Language (levels 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4);</li><li>Hispanic Culture (the people, their customs and history; movies, music, ideologies);</li><li>Literature of Latin America and Spain (poetry, short stories, theater, novels);</li><li>Translation (English to Spanish and Spanish to English)</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Study Abroad Opportunities</h4><ul><li>students just finishing 2<sup>nd</sup> year or in 3<sup>rd</sup> year Spanish classes can enjoy study abroad opportunities</li><li>Universidad Antonio de Nebrija (Madrid)</li><li>Universidad de Salamanca (Spain)</li><li>Universidad de Holguín (Cuba)</li></ul><h3>Generative AI</h3><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p> </p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought.
