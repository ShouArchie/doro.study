  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ARTS 130:</div>
<p>This course provides an introduction to diverse intellectual modes of inquiry in the social sciences and humanities with an emphasis on the development of communication skills. In a small seminar setting, students will explore a variety of topics based on instructor expertise in order to build social awareness, ethical engagement, and communication competencies in comprehension, contextualization, and conceptualization. Students will be expected to engage with the work of others, articulate positions, situate writing and speaking within contexts, practice writing and speaking for situations beyond the classroom, engage in basic forms of research, and workshop, revise, and edit writing.</p>

<h4>Description of this section</h4><p>We live in an “age of apology” in which nations, corporations, churches, universities, and prominent individuals make public apologies for past wrongs. These entities have made statements on residential schools, slavery, racist policies, corporate malfeasance, and personal misconduct. Apologies reflect particular ways of thinking about and relating to the past. They may affirm particular values, commit to a particular future, and mobilize for a common cause. They may also deflect blame and deny responsibility. </p><p>In this course, we analyze specific apologies, as well as scholarly writing about apologies, in order to understand how they work and what they mean. We will consider not only the words that are said, but also the context, settings of public delivery, subsequent actions, and the range of responses to apologies especially by those who have been harmed. When are apologies “just words,” and when might they advance justice, reconciliation, or healing? When do they make things worse? How should individuals think about an apology that has been made on their behalf? What is the place of apologies in public life? </p>

<p>The above outcomes are common to all sections of Arts 130. The following are additional outcomes for this section:</p><p>7. Understand the history, dynamics, problems, and benefits of public apology for past and present wrongs.</p><p>8. Engage critically and ethically with various histories and experiences of oppression for which public apologies have been made or for which they have been called.</p><h3>Course format and class culture</h3><p>In the course, we want to make the most of the fact that we will be together in person and are a relatively small group. I will do very little lecturing. Rather, expect to participate in small group and large group discussions, writing exercises, workshops, and other in-class activities. We will create a learning community together as we get to know each other better throughout the term. I will use LEARN to post links to readings, information about activities and assignments, occasional summaries of what we did in class, etc. However, LEARN is in no way a substitute for coming to class every time. </p><p><i>I do not permit the use of Generative AI to produce text for any assignments in this course. See the policy below for further rationale and details.</i></p><p>This course will include discussion of some of the painful histories for which public apologies have been made, including genocide, slavery, sexual abuse, racial discrimination, residential schools in Canada, and others. I will work to create a supportive and respectful environment for these discussions, an expectation that extends to everyone in the class, mindful that some topics may be triggering for some. If you have concerns about any class content, please communicate these with me. I will seek to accommodate as best I can. </p><p>A note about the rhythm of the course. We will spend class time learning about different forms of communication and doing exercises that develop skills you will use in assignments. Thus, I encourage you not to work too far ahead. For example, you will note that a draft of an “op-ed” (opinion piece) is due in early March. If you are keen, you might be tempted to write this well ahead of the deadline. However, in the weeks just prior to that deadline, we will participate in a short workshop on opinion piece writing and read and discuss several examples. It is best if you draft your own after these activities. I will remind you of the ideal timeline for your assignments. </p><p><i>Please consider others: Do not come and go during the class period unless absolutely necessary. Use devices for taking notes but not for activities unrelated to the course.</i></p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p>In this course, we will explore the settler-colonial policies of Canada (and other nations) which sought to dispossess Indigenous lands and destroy Indigenous cultures, and efforts to acknowledge, redress, and repair these actions. In this way, we hope that the land acknowledgements above will call us to action. </p>

<div>
<h4>I. Engaged attendance and participation (8 + 1 + 1 = 10%)  (Learning goals [LG]: all)</h4><p>You are expected to attend all classes, complete all required readings on time, and engage in informed, critical, balanced (in the sense of not speaking too little or too much) and sensitive ways with others. Come to every class prepared to write (with paper and pencil/pen, or laptop), discuss in small groups, and contribute to all-class discussions. If a draft assignment will be discussed in class, please complete it on time and bring a printed hard copy. </p><p>Please see the section below regarding “Accommodations for illness or extenuating circumstances,” which includes a process for registering absences from class. If there are other compelling reasons why cannot be present on a given, please let me know. If you attend all classes or all classes but two, and participate satisfactorily in class, you can receive 8/8. For each class missed beyond two, there will be a deduction of one mark.</p><p>1% for engaged participation in the in-class “write an apology” exercise, March 7.</p><p>1% for completing the "Integrating Sources" online module, by March 19 (11:59 pm).</p><h4>II. Reading quizzes (8%) (LG: 7, 8)</h4><p>There will be a total of 5 “surprise” quizzes throughout the term, and the best 4 quizzes will count towards your mark (2% each). These quizzes will primarily test whether you have completed the reading with adequate understanding. </p><p>The online quizzes will be available to you for about 2 days and will close 30 minutes before the start of class.</p><h4>III. Three pieces of short critical writing (SCW) (3 x 8% = 24%)</h4><p>Each piece should be 600 to 700 words in length. Be sure to structure your writing in paragraphs. Given the short length of the papers, paragraphs will typically be relatively short as well. The focus of each piece is outlined below. No additional research is expected beyond required readings and engagement in class.</p><p><strong>1. Reflect on yourself as a writer (LG: 1, 2)</strong></p><p>How would you characterize your identity as a writer? What comes easily for you, what do you enjoy, what is a challenge? Be sure to include the following elements:</p><ul><li>Is there a particular piece of writing which you are especially proud, and if so, why?</li><li>Reflect on your experience of required writing (essays, book reviews, creative writing, etc. for school) as well as any writing that you do on your own initiative.</li><li>Identify at least one aspect of your writing, or of your practice of writing, that you hope to improve in the coming months.</li></ul><p>I am not looking for you to write an essay about writing in general, or about the ideals of writing, but rather a very specific reflection on your <i>own experience and practice of writing</i>. I am not assessing you based on what you say about writing but rather based on the depth of your reflection and the quality of writing on display. Due: January 13 (11:59 pm)</p><p><strong>2. Write a critical response to the film </strong><i><strong>A Sorry State</strong></i><strong> by Mitch Miyagawa (LG: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8)</strong></p><p>The film will be shown in class but is also accessible to those who cannot attend or wish to watch it again. You do not need to address all of these questions, but the following may help you to focus your reflections. How does the film-maker’s own positionality (life experience, family relationships, etc.) shape how he engages with the subject matter of apologies? Does his opinion of government apologies change over time? What accounts for some of the differences in how his family members respond in different ways to apologies? Does the film have a primary “message”? Does the film change how you think about public apologies? What are some techniques he uses to communicate his ideas about apologies? You do not need to summarize the content. Assume that reader of your response has viewed the film. Due: February 3 (11:59 pm)</p><p><strong>3. Reflect on the interview/conversation with Archbishop Fred Hiltz (LG: 2, 5, 7, 8)</strong></p><p>Archbishop Hiltz is the former Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada. He delivered an “Apology for Spiritual Harm” on behalf of his church in 2019. </p><p>This is the key question: What did you learn about the practice of public apology from the perspective of someone who wrote and delivered one? </p><p>What was important to him? What was difficult for him? What new perspectives do <i>you</i> have on the problems or benefits of an apology, or about what needs to follow after an apology? Was there anything he said that was surprising to you, and if so, why? Having reflected on the conversation, is there a question that you wished you had asked the guest?  You don’t need to summarize what he said but if you engage with a specific comment or theme, it will be helpful to remind your reader what that is. Due: March 19 (11:59 pm)</p><h4>IV. Summarize one scholarly article (= 10%) (LG: 3, 4, 5, 7)</h4><p>Critical communication requires you to be a careful reader of the writing of others. These exercises build foundational skills that will be valuable throughout your university career and beyond.</p><p>The summary should be 600-700 words. Do not be over or under that length by more than a few lines. This is an exercise in careful reading and concise writing.</p><p>Focus on the big picture. Give an accurate account of the author’s thesis and how they use evidence and argument to support their thesis. This assignment requires critical analysis to the extent that you must determine the essence of what the author is saying, and express it clearly and efficiently. However, do not add your own critical evaluation of the article. </p><p>Use your own words. Summarize and paraphrase. Use direct quotations very sparingly, and only if there is a phrase or particular wording that is so important to the argument that it must be reproduced directly. It is very possible for an excellent summary to have no quotations at all.</p><p>Similar to the conventions for book review, page references are needed only for direct quotations, and may be made, in parentheses, in the text. E.g. As Engert argues, “the ‘sacrament of penance’ is indeed a very useful concept to analytically unpack Germany’s official discourse and policies in acknowledging its political responsibility for the Holocaust” (97). </p><p>You must summarize this article: Govier, Trudy, and Wilhelm Verwoerd. “The Promise and Pitfalls of Apology.” <i>Journal of Social Philosophy</i> 33, no. 1 (2002): 67-82. (I will not accept a summary of a different article.)</p><p>Draft due: January 20 (11:30 am). Bring a hard copy of your assignment with you to class. </p><p>Peer editing (2%): You will review two summaries by fellow students and receive two reviews of your own draft summary. Take a photo of the reviews that <i>you</i> write for others. <i>You will only get marks for participating in this process if you have brought a completed draft to class.</i></p><p>Final version (8%) due: January 22 (11:59 pm)</p><h4>IV. Public writing: opinion piece (18%) (LG: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8)</h4><p>Your piece must be between 700 and 800 words.</p><p>A first draft is due in class February 24. Bring a hard copy with you to class (bring hard copy to class and participate in peer editing for content 1%). Second draft February 26 (bring hard copy to class and participate in peer editing for clarity 1%). <i>You will only get marks for participating in these processes if you have brought a completed draft to class.</i></p><p>Final version (16%) due March 3 (11:59 pm).</p><p>Address the readers of a Canadian daily newspaper. The piece may be related to any of the articles and themes we have discussed in class. It may be related to the apology you will be addressing in your final project. The opinion piece itself is not intended as a research exercise but you may find that your argument will be strengthened by consulting some additional sources. </p><p>A good opinion piece has a clear point of view, makes one point very effectively, and effectively addresses a public audience in a particular time and place. Your main point should be evident in the first few sentences. The topic is wide open, though it should have some relationship to public apologies. It may relate to something we have already discussed in class, or it may relate to the topic you plan to work on for your final project. We will discuss opinion pieces in class and look at some examples. </p><p>An opinion piece such as this may be</p><ul><li>a personal perspective on a public issue (“My family fled the genocide in Rwanda. This is what I think about Bill Clinton’s apology…”)</li><li>an assessment of something that has happened (“Pope Francis said ‘sorry’ in Canada but his visit was disappointing because…”)</li><li>a call for something to happen (“The government of Canada ought to apologize for its complicity in slavery…”)</li><li>a position on a contested issue around public apologies such as forgiveness, reparations, representation, judging the past by the standard of the present, etc. (“A public apology should not be a tool to persuade the public that something was wrong. A public apology should only be made if there is already widespread agreement that what happened was wrong…”)</li></ul><p>Opinion pieces do not typically have any citations, though individuals may be quoted. E.g., “According to scholar Danielle Celermajer, the Australian government’s apology to Indigenous peoples is best understood as an act of ‘national re-covenanting.’” </p><p>On a separate page, indicate where any such quotations or references may be found. This does not count towards the word count. In the above example, indicate the source (including page number) for Celermajer’s claim.</p><h4>V. Final project (30%) (LG: all)</h4><p>You will research and write a 7-8 page paper (about 1700-2000 words) about one public apology, or a call for an apology, and give a 5-6 minute in-class presentation. I will provide a list of potential topics. Because we will have focused so extensively in class on apologies for Residential Schools in Canada, this topic cannot be selected for this assignment. A separate document outlines the details, process, breakdown of marks, and rubrics.</p><p>Presentation: 8% (specific date to be assigned: March 24-April 2)</p><p>Peer evaluations of presentations: 2%</p><p>Paper: 20% due April 9 (11:59 pm)</p><h3>Notes about all assignments:</h3><ul><li><i><strong>Read the instructions carefully and follow them diligently.</strong></i></li><li>Submit all assignments online, through the “Dropbox” in LEARN. However, there may be times when in-class work requires that you bring paper copies of materials. This will be communicated to you in advance. You can access printing services at the Grebel library (in the same building as the classroom), using your Watcard</li><li>Use PDF or MS Word formats, and not a link to a Google Doc.</li><li>I will return assignments in the same format as they were received, with comments added directly to the paper itself. (If you do not see comments on returned work, contact the instructor.) <i>You are expected to read instructor feedback and incorporate it in future work.</i></li><li>Observe carefully the instructions about length of papers. Use a standard 12-point font, double spacing, and standard margins. <i>Include your word count at the end of the paper.</i></li><li>Be sure to give each paper a title.</li><li>For the final research paper, I encourage you to use Chicago Style (Turabian), footnote/bibliography. You may use another accepted scholarly style, such as APA or MLA, but you must be consistent. Use only one style in one assignment.</li><li><i>Regardless of style, you MUST include a page number when using a direct quotation</i>.</li><li>Use inclusive language (e.g. humankind rather than mankind) when referring to people. Avoid use of language that perpetuates stereotypes.</li><li>Add page numbers.</li><li>Proofread your papers.</li></ul><h4>Late submission </h4><ul><li>Plan ahead, make note of due dates, and consider tests and assignments in other courses.</li><li>Each student may claim three (3) days of grace, which are essentially free extensions, for which no rationale needs to be given. These can only be used for the final submission of written assignments, such as short critical writing (SCW) pieces, article summary, opinion piece, or final research paper (not for drafts due in class, reading quizzes, in-class workshop, online citation course, or scheduled presentation).</li><li>How to claim them: You must <i>send an email to the instructor before the deadline of the assignment in question</i>. In that email, indicate which assignment you are referring to, and how many days (1, 2, or 3) you are claiming. You may divide your three days over two or three assignments, or use them all for one assignment.</li><li>If you are not using grace days, and do not have an extension (approved in advance), late assignments will be penalized 3% (of the value of that assignment) per calendar day.</li></ul><p> </p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as the development of critical analysis and persuasive written communication. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
