  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ARTS 130:</div>
<p>This course provides an introduction to diverse intellectual modes of inquiry in the social sciences and humanities with an emphasis on the development of communication skills. In a small seminar setting, students will explore a variety of topics based on instructor expertise in order to build social awareness, ethical engagement, and communication competencies in comprehension, contextualization, and conceptualization. Students will be expected to engage with the work of others, articulate positions, situate writing and speaking within contexts, practice writing and speaking for situations beyond the classroom, engage in basic forms of research, and workshop, revise, and edit writing.</p>

<p>The objective of this course will be to discuss how games are designed, played, and marketed, with an emphasis on the cultural discourse surrounding games. It will prompt students to think about who makes games, who plays games, and in what contexts these playful engagements occur. We will look at a wide variety of types of games, including boardgames, digital games, sports, and tabletop games. Students will not be required to have previous experiences with games, but will be expected to play games as part of the course.</p><p>The course will be centered on quantitative and qualitative content analysis. Students will become versed in such topics as gathering research, establishing and collecting data for virtual worlds research, as well as per-existing library secondary sources on game studies. Students will write auto-ethnographies that reflect their own play experience, and build to conducting analysis through the codifying, systematizing, and thematizing of these reflections. They will construct a class-wide database of secondary sources, which students will draw on for their major research project, a group presentation regarding their experience with game culture. Finally, we'll end the course by reflecting on what we've learned in a short paper. The overall goal of the course is to think about games, how we play games, and how we interact with larger cultures of gaming—while learning some academic skills and having some fun in the process.</p>

<p><strong>Participation – 10% </strong></p><p>Your participation consists of two parts: attendance, and participation in class discussion. Participation can take multiple forms. Occasionally, students will be given be small assignments involving minor exercises and activities that are conducted in class. Students will not be graded on these assignments, but completion will contribute to participation mark. The participation mark will also be a measure of participation in classroom discussions. If you feel uncomfortable participating in such discussions, that’s fine—not everyone excels under the same conditions, and there are certainly circumstances where I’m not comfortable speaking in groups either. Likewise, you can't always be present in class, and I won't penalize you for that absence.<strong> </strong>However, it does mean you're responsible for showing that you're keeping up with class concepts and discussion. Instead, post your responses to the discussion board. (And in general, use the discussion board for posting any thoughts you didn't have a chance to voice in class.)</p><p><strong>Attendance</strong> -- I will be keeping track of attendance, and using it to gauge leeway when it comes to extensions and other such issues. Further, you can’t participate if you’re not present (unless, again, you’ve made other arrangements). As students, you are under a lot of pressure and will not always be able to attend; I recognize that, and would appreciate a head’s up if you can’t make it class, particularly for multiple absences or a continual lateness.</p><p>After your third absence, you must post a response to the discussion board for the classes you've missed. So for example, if you miss four classes, you should post a response to the exercise from the lecture for one of those classes. It doesn't have to be the fourth class—it could be any of the four—but it would have to be at least one, and at least one more for any absence after that point. All discussion board posts must be posted within 2 weeks of the original lecture to count for participation or attendance (All lecture slides will be posted within 48 hours of the lecture.)</p><p><strong>Assignments </strong></p><p>Further information regarding each of the assignments will be posted to the course assignment page as their due dates approach. In essence, each one has you approach a different, but related, communication goal. For the debrief, you are showing your ability to apply the methods discussed in class to our play and mapping. For the autoethnography, you're taking your experience with play and turning it into an argument about games and their players. For the annotated bibliography, you are compiling a set of critical perspectives around a subject related to games and their wider cultures. For the group presentation, you are working with others to speak informally but critically on a specific game or topic, using what you've learned about analysis, players, and existing game research. And for reflection paper, you're constructing an argument about what you've learned in the course as a whole.</p><p>One of the principles behind this course (and ARTS 130 and 140 courses in general) is called <strong>scaffolding</strong>: each assignment is about building skills that are then further developed and built upon for future assignments. Through this approach, you will see how your knowledge is growing, and building upon what you already know.</p><p>For the group assignments, students will be required to fill out the group assignment checklist.</p><p>Late assignments will be deducted 2% per school day, unless there are relevant extenuating circumstances. However, I will be generous with extensions, provided they are asked for 48 hours before the assignment is due, and a full draft is brought (when appropriate) to peer review days. All assignments, with the exception of the group presentation, are open to extension.</p>

  No assignment screening will be used in this course.

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Course Policies</strong></p><p>Course policies are essentially based on respectful communication and setting clear expectations. If something about the course, be it an assignment or policy, is not clear to you please write me and we will sort the issue. Please take the time to read the syllabus and the assignments carefully and ask me questions if you’re not sure about something. A syllabus functions as a kind of contract between instructor and student, but more importantly it is a resource and connects you to resources both in the classroom and around campus. I want to make this course as useful to you as possible, and that means—as is always the case in technical communication—clearly communicating our expectations of each other and making sure everyone is on the same page.</p><p><strong>Declaring absences </strong><br/>Please see the Academic Regulations section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work.</p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong><br/>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.</p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness</strong><br/>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process. Submission through the Absence Verification System, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students should not submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong><br/>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances to the Absence Verification System for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness </strong>Students can self-declare an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason </strong>Students can self-declare one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and no documentation is required. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Recording lecture</strong></p><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p><p><strong>Late Work, Missed Assignments Policy</strong></p><p>For the assignments and introductory posts, the late penalty is 2% per school day. However, I tend to be pretty generous with extensions, and with late penalties occurred because of unforeseeable circumstances—emergencies and technical difficulties included. If you ask me for an extension, I'm likely going to grant it. The catch is that you need to contact me. Contact me if you want an extension, and contact me if you want to explain a late submission. I'll contact you as well at a certain point, but the responsibility here is on your end. Again, I know you're under enormous pressure, so I will be willing to work out alternative arrangements. In general, I'd prefer if extensions are requested at least 48 hours before the final due date of an assignment.</p><p><strong><u>Academic Integrity</u>: </strong>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. [Check <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/"><u>www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/</u></a> for more information.]</p><p><strong><u>Use of Generative AI in this course</u></strong></p><p>There are still a lot of ethical and legal issues regarding generative AI that are in the process of being settled. In general, I would recommend against using it for any purpose in this class, whether that be for discussions or assignments; part of the purpose of a writing-intensive course is to help you develop the ability to draft and organize arguments on your own, and an outside tool can be detrimental to that development. If you do use any form of generative AI for any submission (including assignments, discussion posts) you need to ask me first, provide screenshots of the prompts you used and the output you received, and illustrate significant editing in crafting the output to your own original ideas. I expect to see a lot of work in editing and expanding in any AI-assisted efforts. Do not enter any text or image into a generative AI that you don't have legal authority to distribute.</p><p><strong>Mental Health Support</strong></p><p>All of us need a support system.
