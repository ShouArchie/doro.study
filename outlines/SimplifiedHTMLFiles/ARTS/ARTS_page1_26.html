<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ARTS 140:</div>
<p>This course introduces students to diverse ways of finding, examining, and using data and information in the social sciences and humanities. In a small seminar setting, students will explore a variety of topics based on instructor expertise in order to understand quantitative and qualitative methods of data gathering and build competencies in conceptualizing, contextualizing, and comprehending methods of information analysis. Students will be expected to investigate, use, and assess the presentation of information in their own work and the work of others so that they can better understand the range of social, ethical, and political challenges of our world.</p>

<p>Social change is the most inevitable process in human history, and yet it is seemingly the most elusive or challenging for those seeking social justice and liberation. Theories of how to turn desires for social justice into tangible actions abound in the humanities and social sciences, and various historical and contemporary social movements have provided us with useful knowledge and resources for the continuing project of justice and social change. This course uses experiential learning to help students explore the possibility of turning social justice goals into action through a case study approach that builds students' skillsets in research, communication, collaboration, and decision-making. While focusing on social action, we will simultaneously explore methodological approaches to gathering, assessing, and presenting information and ideas. Drawing on the work of social theorists, activists, artists, filmmakers, writers, poets, and pop icons, this course will engage the question: How can everyday people work together to effect social change?</p>

  Administrative Policy

<div>
<h3>Course Policies</h3><h4>Late Policy</h4><p><strong>Weekly Portfolio Activities</strong></p><p>Weekly deadlines have been provided to help you stay on track with course work.  It is very important that you do your best to keep up with submitting activities according to the time set out on the Course Schedule. However, these deadlines are <strong>not considered</strong> "<strong>firm</strong>." Rather, they are "soft" deadlines that are designed to help you manage your time effectively.  <strong>The Weekly Activity dropboxes will actually remain open until the final deadline indicated on the Course Schedule.</strong> This allows you the flexibility to submit past the soft deadline if you need to, without having to seek permission from your instructor. Bear in mind, however, that persistent, undocumented lateness in submitting your activities may reflect negatively on your portfolio grades.</p><p><strong>Discussions</strong></p><p>Deadlines for posting and replying to discussions have been provided to facilitate meaningful discourse; i.e., to enable you to exchange ideas with your peers, construct and confirm understanding, and collaborate with each other.  As such, <strong>these deadlines are considered "firm"</strong> – i.e., <strong>it is crucial that you meet the deadlines both for posting and replying as outlined in the Course Schedule</strong>. These deadlines help us to avoid the scenario where everyone posts just before the deadline, and true discourse becomes impossible.</p><p><strong>Assignments (Keyword Assignment, (Pod)Cast Assignment)</strong></p><p>All assignments are expected to be submitted on time, and <strong>deadlines for these are considered</strong> "<strong>firm.</strong>" If you encounter circumstances that you feel may cause you to be late in submitting any particular assignment you should contact your instructor immediately, explain the circumstances, and we may negotiate an extension. To do so, you must be in contact with your instructor <strong>at least 48 hours prior to the deadline</strong> to request an extension. Late assignments will be accepted up to a week beyond the deadline at a penalty of 2% per day. After the fifth day, late assignments will not be accepted for any reason except those outlined in the University of Waterloo calendar (e.g., medical or family emergencies, or some other such event) and will receive a grade of 0. If an extension is granted, you are expected to submit your assignment at the agreed-upon time and date, with the appropriate documentation. Please review the Waterloo policy regarding accommodation for illness for unforeseen circumstances.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of the instructor, which can include:</p><ul><li>lecture handouts and presentations (e.g., PowerPoint slides)</li><li>lecture content, both spoken and written (and any audio or video recording thereof)</li><li>questions from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams)</li><li>work protected by copyright (i.e., any work authored by the instructor)</li></ul><p>Making available the intellectual property of instructors without their express written consent (e.g., uploading lecture notes or assignments to an online repository) is considered theft of intellectual property and subject to disciplinary sanctions as described in Policy 71 – Student Discipline. Students who become aware of the availability of what may be their instructor’s intellectual property in online repositories are encouraged to alert the instructor.</p><h3>Department Policies</h3><h4>Academic Integrity</h4><p>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. See the Waterloo <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/"><u>Academic Integrity</u></a> webpage for more information.</p><p>Students should also be aware that copyright laws in Canada prohibit reproducing more than 10% of any work without permission from its author, publisher, or other copyright holder. You can view the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-guidelines/fair-dealing-advisory"><u>Fair Dealing Advisory</u></a> webpage for more. Violation of Canada’s Copyright Act is a punishable academic offence under Policy 71 – Student Discipline.</p><h4>A Respectful Living and Learning Environment For All</h4><ol><li>It is expected that everyone living, learning or working on the premises of Renison University College will contribute to an environment of tolerance and respect by treating others with sensitivity and civility.</li><li>Harassment is unwanted attention in the form of jokes, insults, gestures, gossip, or other behaviours that are meant to intimidate. Some instances of harassment are against the law in addition to Renison University College policy.</li><li>Discrimination is treating people differently because of their race, disability, sex, sexual orientation, ancestry, colour, age, creed, marital status, or other personal characteristics. The Ontario Human Rights Code considers actions and behaviours rather than intentions.</li><li>If you experience or witness either harassment or discrimination, you may contact the Renison University College <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/renison/current-students/harassment-and-discrimination"><u>Harassment and Discrimination </u></a> Officer.</li></ol><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>With gratitude, we acknowledge that Renison University College is located on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg, Hodinohsyó:ni, and Attawandaran (Neutral) Peoples, which is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes ten kilometres on each side of the Grand River from mouth to source. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place in all corners of our campus through research, learning, teaching, community building and outreach. We are guided by the work of our Reconciliation and Re-storying Steering Committee and Anti-Racism and Decolonization Spokescouncil, as well as the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous"><u>University of Waterloo’s Office of Indigenous Relations</u></a>.</p><h4>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as collecting, synthesizing, and analyzing information, and conducting. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>
