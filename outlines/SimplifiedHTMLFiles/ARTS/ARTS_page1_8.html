This list does not fully capture the inherent overlap between many of the activities of this course, and it is not meant to prioritize one competency over the other. However, this will give you a good sense of what is expected of you over the course of the semester.</p><h4> </h4><h4><strong>Accountability Competency (30%) (Attendance and Presence)</strong></h4><p>As you can see from the weighting of this category, being “present” – both physically and mentally – is a key aspect of this course. <strong>You will not pass this class if you do not attend our class sessions.  </strong>However, depending on what you want to get from this course, it is possible to take a limited number of unexcused absences during specified weeks (see our “Grading Scheme” document and our “Course Schedule” for more information). </p><p>Attendance will be taken in class and accompanied by:</p><p><strong>Exit Tickets</strong></p><p>These informal activities are a way for you to begin engaging with our class materials and to build ideas that can be transformed into more formal assignments (like those associated with writing, presentation, and collaboration). In this way, these exit tickets (and the in-class activities that are associated with them) build an important foundation for you to be successful in this course.  Along with your in-person attendance, these exit tickets will be used to gauge your <i>presence</i> in both physical and mental aspects, and you will have some time in each class to begin completing these. </p><p><strong>Significant Corresponding Activities:</strong></p><p><strong>Any assignment associated with Writing, Presentation, and Collaboration competencies</strong></p><p> </p><h4><strong>Writing Competency (25%)</strong></h4><p> </p><p><strong>Personal Reflection (500 words; 2 sources) (draft, final version, revisions: 5%)</strong></p><p>The goal of this writing is to use personal experience and perspective as a starting point to shed light on the prevailing conversation surrounding a given issue in the world around us. Towards this end, ask yourself: what is the most pressing issue facing our world today? How do you feel about this issue and how does it relate to other perspectives, as gathered through source material?</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><p>You need to demonstrate the larger “conversation” that surrounds the topic that you are choosing to engage with. Over the course of your writing, you will need to include references to at least one source. This source will help you frame the topic that you are responding to – feel free to reference more than one source if you need to!</p><p>-You must include a reference to the AI-generated image(s) that your group constructed in our earlier class session. A good place to start is to think about your reactions to this image. Feel free to express how it does/does not capture your thoughts on the topic that you are writing about. What does it get right about this issue – what does it get wrong? Etc.</p><p>-You can discuss your “personal experience” in any way that you like. Perhaps you want to make this an opinion-oriented piece based on your observations relating to the topic of your choice, or maybe you want to directly draw on a personal anecdote to help shed light on the topic that you are going to discuss. *Remember: in addition to myself, some of your peers will read a first draft, so do not feel compelled to share personal anecdotes, unless you want to do so.*</p><p>-You can structure your essay in any way that you choose. Keep in mind, though, that you are trying to connect with a reader, and so you need to consider how that is best accomplished in regard to organization and expression. Academic conventions will be required for the rest of the semester, but feel free to approach this assignment as you think fit.</p><p>-However, you will need to provide a works cited list, following MLA or APA conventions as close as possible, and you will need to include an AI disclosure form.</p><p>In addition to this essay, you need to include a brief reflection (no more than 250 words; this does not count toward the 500-word count for the essay) on what you did and/or did not incorporate from your peer's feedback and explain why you made those decisions.</p><p><strong>Significant Corresponding Activities:</strong></p><p><strong>Exit Tickets #2; #3a and 3b</strong></p><p><strong>Peer Review Workshop #1</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>“Topic of Inquiry” Academic Essay (1000 words, 4 sources) (draft, final version, revisions: 15%)</strong></p><p>In our unit devoted to collecting and analyzing evidence, we studied a variety of different “texts,” including journalism, scholarly articles, and a variety of other types of media. Some of this material was assigned and some of it was found independently and collaboratively. In light of this experience, I want you to engage with a “topic of inquiry” accessed through an analysis of media and text. The challenge of this essay is to narrow your focus to a specific element of this unit that interested you, and to do so in such a way that draws across different kinds of texts. You can use your café presentation as a starting point for this writing.</p><p><strong>*Remember: you can take this essay in any direction that you like, as long as you fulfill the requirements.*</strong></p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><p>-You must discuss four sources in this essay. You can draw from assigned readings or viewings, sources posted by members of your or another group, but you must include at least one scholarly source, one non-scholarly source, and some kind of media (film, TV, social media, website, etc.) that you will analyze as part of your discussion. You can also use more sources to make your argument if you need to.</p><p>-You must follow academic conventions in organizing and expressing your ideas (in short: intro, thesis, body, conclusion, properly cited evidence, etc.). You will also need to include an AI disclosure form as part of your submission.</p><p>-In addition to this essay, you need to include a brief reflection (no more than 250 words; this does not count toward the 1000-word count for the essay) on what you did and/or did not incorporate from your peer's feedback and explain why you made those decisions.</p><p><strong>Significant Corresponding Activities:</strong></p><p><strong>Exit Tickets #4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10a, 10b, 11a, 11b </strong>(depending on your approach)</p><p><strong>Café Presentation</strong></p><p><strong>Peer Review #2</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Final Reflection on Skills/Course (500 words) (draft, final version: 5%)</strong></p><p>This reflective narrative will discuss the intersections between your ARTS 130 experience and transferable skills. You will want to put forward an honest assessment of what you struggled with and how you overcame these challenges, what you excelled in over the semester, what you were most and least proud of, and what skills you strengthened as a result. It would be an excellent idea to return to our last week content in order to match up specific skills with this experience.</p><p>In this discussion, you will want to engage with particular examples from the course, and you will want to create a kind of narrative of your experience and how it contributed to your growth; it would also be good to include some thoughts on what this means for the future (what are you confident in moving forward? What do you foresee a need to improve upon? How might this translate into other academic or career contexts? Etc.). </p><p><strong>Significant Corresponding Activities:</strong></p><p><strong>Exit Tickets #14, 15</strong></p><p><strong>Peer Review #3 (Consultation)</strong></p><p><strong>Any assignment associated with Writing, Presentation, and Collaboration competencies </strong>(depending on your approach)</p><p> </p><h4><strong>Presentation Competency (25%)</strong></h4><p><strong>Café Presentation</strong> <strong>(6 minutes per segment/person: aim for 3-4 minutes presentation; 2-3 minutes for Q&amp;A) (10%)</strong></p><p>These presentations can discuss any social issue that you are interested in exploring. As part of the process of engaging with the ideas of others and building your own, you will participate in an informal, small-group presentation format that also can be leveraged into a brainstorming session to orient you to the “topic of inquiry” essay.</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><p>In small groups during week #7, you will be given a 6-minute timeslot, of which you should fill no more than 4 minutes with an informal presentation that discusses your analysis of a variety of sources related to a topic of your choosing. Any leftover time after you give your presentation will be devoted to small group discussion. Details will be posted on LEARN as we get closer to this date, but in addition to a works cited, you will also need to include an AI disclosure form as part of your final submission.</p><p><strong>Significant Corresponding Activities:</strong></p><p><strong>Personal Reflection</strong></p><p><strong>Topic of Inquiry</strong></p><p><strong>Exit Tickets #4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10a, 10b, 11a, 11b </strong>(depending on your approach)</p><p>     </p><p><strong>Group Teaching Project</strong> <strong>(Format: Variable; 10 sources, variable) (15%)</strong></p><p>This “teaching” project is asking your group (comprised of no more than 4 people) to educate someone about a social issue or many social issues and their representations in the media. Each person may find that they can leverage their work on the café presentation and topic of inquiry as part of their contribution to this project (although this is not a requirement).</p><p>There are a number of things to keep in mind as you decide how to approach the project:</p><ol><li>What formats help “educate” people? You could choose to work in academic formats (a collaborative paper; a traditional whole-class presentation), but you could also choose to work in more informal ways as well (blogs; social media campaigns; website production; creative projects; etc.).</li><li>Does your group want to work with many social issues or just one? If you want to discuss more than one social issue, what is the “throughline” that connects them?</li><li>What do you need to contextualize about this/these social issue/s for someone to understand its importance?</li><li>What kind of media (film; TV; literature; journalism; web sources; social media; etc.) do you want to analyze as part of this discussion?</li></ol><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><p>There will be more details on LEARN as we get closer to the due date, however, here are some parameters:</p><p>-Each group will have 8-10 minutes to unveil their project. It goes without saying that attendance is mandatory.</p><p>-Regardless of the type of project, each person will need to speak about their group project, in some capacity. In the case of a presentation, this is already baked in (the project <i>is </i>the discussion); if you are creating something like a website, for example, you need to briefly contextualize it before people look it over and ask you questions.</p><p>-The format of this discussion will change based on what each group chooses to do for their project: a presentation would be completed in front of the whole class, but any other projects will be discussed in a similar format as the café presentation. Details will follow.</p><p>-Each group will be assigned <strong>2 other group projects </strong>to focus their attention in class as well as in a follow-up written evaluation. Each person needs to produce their own evaluation and are also responsible for writing up a reflection on the comments that they receive (this will be a separate graded category, found in the next section). </p><p>- In addition to your in-class unveiling, you must also upload your materials to the LEARN discussion forum so that those people assigned to evaluate you can access your documents as they complete their write up. You will also need to include an AI disclosure form as part of this submission. </p><p><strong>Significant Corresponding Activities:</strong></p><p><strong>Exit Tickets #12, 13a, and 13b</strong></p><p><strong>Café Presentation </strong>(depending on your approach)</p><p><strong>Topic of Inquiry </strong>(depending on your approach)</p><p><strong>Presentation Evaluation and Reflection</strong></p><h4> </h4><h4><strong>Collaboration Competency (20%)</strong></h4><p> </p><p><strong>Peer Review #1: Personal Reflection Workshop (250-500 words) (3%)</strong></p><p>Please follow the template provided in order to provide constructive feedback on your peer’s “Personal Reflection” draft. This workshop will be an introduction to the more formalized and in-depth peer review process that you will encounter in the next workshop.</p><p><strong>Significant Corresponding Activities:</strong></p><p><strong>Personal Reflection</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Peer Review #2: “Topic of Inquiry” Essay Workshop (250-500 words) (6%)</strong></p><p>Please follow the template provided in order to provide constructive feedback on your peer’s “Topic of Inquiry” draft. This workshop is a more formalized and in-depth peer review process.</p><p><strong>Significant Corresponding Activities:</strong></p><p><strong>Topic of Inquiry Essay</strong><br/>            </p><p><strong>Presentation Evaluation and Reflection (3 documents in total: 250 words each)</strong> <strong>(8%) </strong></p><p>There are three documents associated with this grading component. The first two documents are related to a brief evaluation of two group projects, assigned by me to ensure there is an even number of comments for each group. This evaluation isn’t meant to be harsh or to assign a grade but is more in the line of the critical narrative exercise completed earlier in the semester. To create this evaluation/narrative, it is a good idea to state what you feel the project is about more generally before pointing out its strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for future thought. The third document is a reflection on the comments that you received from other groups: what did you find helpful? What did you agree/disagree with in these comments? How will this help you in future endeavours?</p><p><strong>Significant Corresponding Activities:</strong></p><p><strong>Peer Review #2</strong></p><p><strong>Group Teaching Project</strong></p><p>            </p><p><strong>Peer Review #3 (Consultation) (250-500 words) (3%)</strong></p><p>This peer review takes a more discussion-based approach and will be based on your peer’s approach towards the final reflection writing for the course. In addition to this in-class discussion, you will produce a document that captures what was discussed with your peer, some major points that emerged during this discussion, and some future suggestions to consider as they work on this writing. Please follow the template on LEARN to complete this peer review.</p><p><strong>Significant Corresponding Activities:</strong></p><p><strong>Final Reflection on Skills/Course</strong></p><p> </p><h3>HANDING IN ASSIGNMENTS</h3><p>Assignments will be handed in on pebblepad+, LEARN, and through collaborative documents as found on platforms like Google Docs and other programs. Do not hesitate to reach out to me if you are struggling to meet a due date for a particular assignment -- there's no shame in reaching out to let me know what is going on. On a related note, most due dates are <strong>incredibly flexible</strong>, barring those assignments which occur in a group context (like the café presentation, the group teaching project, peer workshops, etc.). </p><p> </p><h3>REQUIRED TECHNOLOGIES</h3><p>In this course, you will be required to submit work on LEARN (both dropboxes and discussion forum), pebblepad+ (linked through LEARN), on shared collaborative documents (as found on sites like Google Drive) and to attend one online meeting on MS Teams (which will also be where office hours are held). In addition to LEARN, there will also be a channel of communication open through Discord and UWaterloo email (which is required for all formal communications, including notification of absences or other similar things).</p><p> </p><h3>ELECTRONIC DEVICE POLICY</h3><p>Electronic devices (laptops, phones, tablets) are <i>encouraged </i>in this course. If you do not have an electronic device, no worries! Each group will have access to a computer. Often, I will ask the class to look up things online and post your findings for the class. Also, you may find that as certain topics and ideas arise during class discussion that you want to look something up in order to supplement what is going on within the classroom. If you will be using a cellphone for these activities, be sure to turn off the ringer on your cellphone at the start of each class. However, and this is important: you need to be respectful of this policy! If you find that it is just too difficult to have your device in hand and not use it to check email, dms, instagram, etc., please leave it at home or in your bag.</p><p>Exceptions: Emergencies sometimes come up which will require you to have your phone out just in case whoever needs to reach you can easily do so. In this case, just let me know that you are currently experiencing this situation and, if your phone rings, please leave the classroom to talk.</p><p> </p><h3>GROUP WORK</h3><p>In some form, group work will occur in every single class meeting and online. Although I understand that some people are quieter than others, all students are required to participate in small group settings to the best of their ability.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<h4>Remote Class Sessions</h4><p>Our class sessions will take place in person, in PHYS 235, and there will be no option to virtually attend our in-person class sessions. The only exception to this is during the peer workshop #2, which will be held on Teams. </p><p>The only other exception to this rule is if I can't attend class in person due to weather, illness, and/or other emergencies. In these scenarios, I may move class to MS Teams and/or develop an alternative activity as a way to fulfill the day's objectives. You will be notified of any changes through our LEARN announcements.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

You will be required to turn in an AI disclosure form for all major assignments.</p><p>Please see LEARN for the more detailed AI policy for this course (including the AI disclosure form required for all major assignments).</p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6.</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website</a> </p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
