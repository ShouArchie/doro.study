  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ARTS 130:</div>
<p>This course provides an introduction to diverse intellectual modes of inquiry in the social sciences and humanities with an emphasis on the development of communication skills. In a small seminar setting, students will explore a variety of topics based on instructor expertise in order to build social awareness, ethical engagement, and communication competencies in comprehension, contextualization, and conceptualization. Students will be expected to engage with the work of others, articulate positions, situate writing and speaking within contexts, practice writing and speaking for situations beyond the classroom, engage in basic forms of research, and workshop, revise, and edit writing.</p>

<p>How do societies deal with past atrocities? In this course, we will analyze how communities around the world have sought to reckon with and heal from historical injustices. We will look at different mechanisms for redress, including truth commissions, reparations, and apologies. Throughout the course, students will be asked to consider two key questions: how do we establish the "truth" about past violence and what does justice mean in the context of historical redress? As part of this, we will explore what types of evidence are used in these processes, including testimonies and archival materials, and look at which sources and whose voices are centred. We will also analyze the outcomes of historical redress processes for affected communities and consider who benefits from these actions. Case studies will be drawn from around the globe, including Canada, South Africa, the United States, and Kenya.  </p><p> </p>

<p><strong><u>Class Community:</u> </strong>Given that this course<strong> </strong>examines how societies deal with mass violence, there is a lot of difficult and sensitive content that may be challenging to learn about. It is important to ensure that the learning environment (in person and online) is a safe, inclusive, and positive space for everyone. We will work together to create an atmosphere of mutual respect and sensitivity in how we approach the topics. Each student brings their own unique set of life experiences, ideas, identities, and opinions into the classroom, and it is important to keep an open mind and try to learn from each other while being respectful of others’ experiences. Please see the Participation Guidelines and other resources on LEARN for more information. </p><p><strong><u>Generative AI:</u> </strong>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><ul><li><strong>Course specific guidelines:</strong> Generative AI may be used in course assignments with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement.

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><p><strong><u>Intellectual Property:</u> </strong>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h3> </h3><p> </p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests.
