<p><strong><u>Participation</u></strong></p><p>The chat will record participation for any online classes via MS Teams. Manual recording will be used for in-person classes. In appreciation of the fact that some people are introverted, there will be multiple recorders and multiple notetakers per class. Recorders are responsible for keeping track of people who participate by marking a checkmark on the sheets provided. Recorders give themselves and notetakers a star on the sheets provided to denote their participation mark for each class. Notetakers will supply recorders with class notes via email – the email must be received to count for a participation mark.  </p><p>Students receive marks by answering questions raised in the lecture. One mark will be supplied per class, except in exceptional cases where the professor notes the allocation of a bonus mark (max one per class). Special pens will be supplied to notetakers. <i><strong>Only checkmarks made by recorders with these ink colors will count toward participation marks. Please check to ensure your mark(s) was recorded. </strong></i> </p><p><strong><u>Online Quizzes</u></strong></p><p>Each quiz will be completed on LEARN during the regular class time. Once you start, you will have 40 minutes to complete the quiz. Each quiz has 20 questions worth 0.5 marks each (2 minutes/question). The midterm quiz covers lectures up to the Reading Week. The final quiz covers all lecture content following the Reading Week. You are only eligible for the make-up assessment if you have a VIF or UW Accommodation for a missed quiz.</p><p><strong><u>Marketing Tool Assignments</u></strong></p><p>Every other week, you will be assigned an assignment using a marketing tool corresponding to the lecture topic. The tool will be explained in class, so attendance is very important. Each Worksheet is worth 10% of your final grade.   </p><p><strong><u>Capstone Project</u></strong></p><p>Irrespective of the option you select, signed Acknowledgments must be submitted to the appropriate Dropbox folder on LEARN. This is a legal requirement for participating in client-based experiential learning.</p><p><i><strong>PICK ONE: </strong></i>Experiential Learning (Group) OR Strategic Market Plan (Individual)  </p><p><i><strong>1. Experiential Learning “EL” (Group Project Option): </strong></i>The class has been randomly assigned to sub-teams on Learn.  </p><ul><li>Instructions: Please see Learn – Contents – Capstone Project – “Experiential Learning Instructions”. Under the same folder, you can find a template for the Final Report and a Peer Evaluation Form (with sample grade distribution). If you do not complete the Peer Evaluation by the deadline, you are deemed to have given all members of your team 10/10.  </li><li>Virtual PPP Meetings: One person from each EL team must join weekly meetings to provide the instructor with an update on the team’s Progress, Problems, and Plans. If your Project Manager cannot do so, they must appoint someone to attend.</li><li>Termination: To simulate the actual job of a marketing consulting firm, students can quit or be fired from the Experiential Learning project. The student will be transferred into the SMP alternative upon quitting or termination.  <ul><li>Quitting: Students can quit anytime on or before Capstone #6 with 24 hours written notice to your team and the instructor.  </li><li>Termination: Students can be fired by majority vote after three communication attempts, three missed meetings, or if a team member fails to complete their prescribed tasks by a deadline agreed to by the group. Groups must notify the team member and the instructor of this termination. Members must be terminated on or before Capstone #6.  </li></ul></li></ul><p><i><strong>2. Strategic Market Plan “SMP” (Individual Project Option): </strong></i>When students quit or are terminated from the EL Team, they must email the Professor and request to be switched to the SMP alternative (no credit given for previous work).  </p><ul><li>Instructions: Please refer to Learn – Contents – Capstone Project – “Strategic Marketing Plan”.</li><li>PPP Meetings: You are to submit written weekly reports on your Progress, Problems, and Plans to the Learn Dropbox called “SMP PPP”.  </li></ul><p><i><strong>For BOTH options 1. and 2. above, a mark of -1 will be deducted from the Final Assessment for every missed PPP (up to 10 marks).</strong></i></p><p>Students are provided 80 minutes of weekly class time for the Capstone Project. This is a minimum time commitment. The work is expected to be completed professionally and on time every week – even if that means working beyond the 80 minutes of class time provided. Since class time is given weekly, <i><strong>no extensions are permitted</strong></i>.</p><p><strong><u>Late Penalty</u></strong></p><p>Students must complete each course assessment by the due date specified above. Excepting a VIF or UW “Accommodation” (http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations), <i><strong>late submissions are subject to a 2-mark per day penalty. </strong></i>Late submissions will not be accepted more than five days past the specified due date, resulting in a grade of zero. If you have a VIF, the missed assessment must be completed on the day after your VIF period ends. No accommodation will be made after this time. The student is responsible for emailing the instructor (cc the TA) to arrange the completion of missed course components.  </p><p> </p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Cross-listed courses</h4><p>Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject code.</p><h4>Held-with courses</h4><p>Please note that a held-with course will only count in the average for the subject code under which it has been taken, unless it is cross-listed with the subject code of its’ held-with course. For example, if a CLAS/HIST held-with course is taken under the CLAS subject code then it will count only in the CLAS major average, not the HIST major average. A held-with course will also only count towards program and breadth requirements of the subject code under which it is taken, unless it is cross-listed with the subject code of its’ held-with course.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system. The faculty and staff in Arts encourage students to seek out mental health support if they are needed.</p><p><strong>On campus supports</strong></p><p>For counselling (individual or group) reach out to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Campus Wellness and Counselling Services.</a> Counselling Services strives to provide a secure, supportive environment for students of all orientations and backgrounds.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing.
