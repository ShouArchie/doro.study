</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Certain concepts from business and economics including market responsiveness, decision-making process, willingness to purchase, product differentiation, and advertising will be incorporated into the development of a strategic marketing plan. In addition to teaching central concepts and models from both marketing and economic theory, students will be placed in a forum where they can apply these concepts in a 'real world' marketing situation.</p><p>This course was designed with the structure of three Modules (Modules 1, 2, and 3). Within each module there are four weeks of content which includes lessons, related readings, assignments, and activities. As you work through the content in each module you will gain an understanding of marketing concepts and applications that will directly apply to your Group Marketing Plan Project (Parts B, C, and D). The Final Report (Part E) incorporates all three of these assignments into one Marketing Plan report.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Course Policies</h3><p>Back dated declarations to cover missed assessments are against course policy and not accepted during the term and/or after the classes end. It is not possible to make arrangements at the end of the term by bringing medical notes or by declaring back dated absence to cover missed assessments. For any of the assessments, back dated medical notes, documentation or back dated absence declarations (with or without documentation) are not accepted. </p><h4>Missing a Quiz</h4><p>There are three quizzes in total. Each quiz is open for two consecutive days. Missing a quiz will automatically result in a grade of zero for that quiz. A consideration for missed quizzes will only be given in the case of illness or emergency reasons that goes on for the duration of the 2 days of the quiz and submitted while the quiz is still open. Such excuses as prior personal travel plans, work related engagements, and extra-curricular commitments are not legitimate reasons.</p><p>Self-declaration of short-term illness, any extenuating circumstances, public health event requiring an absence due to illness or a requirement to self-isolate <u>must be submitted to </u><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances"><u>Accommodations for illness or extenuating circumstances page</u></a><u> before the access to the quiz closes and must cover the duration of the 2 days that the quiz is open</u>. Students must upload their completed VIF forms to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances"><u>Accommodations for illness or extenuating circumstances page</u></a> (covering the 2 full days that the quiz is open) while the quiz is still open. Sending VIF after the quiz closes or at the end of the term trying to cover a missed quiz is not accepted. Instructor is not involved in private information about health conditions. Do not e-mail pictures, videos or details of your health condition to the instructor. You must declare it on Art’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances"><u>Accommodations for illness or extenuating circumstances page</u></a> while the quiz is still open. Timely declaration is required. Post dated declarations or post dated VIF is not accepted. Sending an e-mail to the instructor after the quiz closes with or without documentation is not accepted. Declaring of illness must be done on the accommodation page before the access to the quiz ends and must cover the duration of the two days that the quiz is open. </p><p>If your excuse satisfies the above criteria, the missed quiz's mark will be entered as the average of the other two quizzes' marks. For example, if quiz 2 is missed due to approved reasons as stated above, quiz 2's mark will be equal to (quiz 1 mark + quiz 3 mark) / 2. </p><p>In the cases of missing more than one quiz with approved reasons that satisfy the above criteria, you might be given late access to the quiz. There is no shifting of the weight since there is no final exam. </p><p>39% late penalty will be applied in the case of late access to a quiz if it is approved. In order to be approved for late access, the student must contact the instructor no later than the day the quiz closes. No more than 1 time late access will be granted during the entire term which includes all 3 quizzes. No late access to quizzes will be provided for students who miss more than one quiz.  </p><p>It is not possible to make arrangements at the end of the term by bringing medical notes to cover missed deadlines. This remedy is a privilege and not a right. No additional assignments or work will be assigned to improve the marks. The quiz schedule has been set and will not be changed. </p><h4>Missing a Discussion Posting</h4><p>Each discussion topic is open for 5 consecutive days. <u>You cannot e-mail discussion posts to the instructor after the discussion board closes</u>. Similarly, you cannot e-mail discussion board postings to the instructor during the discussions are open. It defeats the purpose of a discussion if it is e-mailed to the instructor.  <u>No discussion posts will be marked from e-mails. No exceptions.</u> It is not possible to make up missed discussion topic postings. No extensions will be given on the deadlines for the postings.</p><ul><li>Every student <strong>must post to LEARN discussion board twice.</strong> Posts on platforms other than LEARN discussion board are not accepted. <u>Students who do not post at all will receive zero from dropbox group mark and zero from 5-star rating mark. Students who post only once will receive at most half of the dropbox group mark. </u></li><li>Every student must <strong>read and rate</strong> the postings of the group members on LEARN in order to earn marks. You cannot rate posts once the discussion board closes on Day 5 (Friday) at 5:00 pm.</li><li>Each discussion board will be open for 5 days (Day 1 (Monday) at 8:00 AM to Day 5 (Friday) at 5:00 PM).</li><li>Discussion board closes on Day 5 (Friday) at 5:00 PM and <strong>no one can post after Day 5 (Friday), 5:00 pm. Do not wait until the very last day or very last hours/minutes to post. This is a group discussion and you are expected to discuss, read and rate posts. Make sure to enter it to your calendar with a deadline earlier than Friday 5:00 pm to give yourselves time to post, rate and discuss. </strong></li><li><strong>Contacting the instructor after the discussion board closes and sending posts via email is not accepted under any circumstances. </strong></li><li>Group members get together after the discussion board closes and prepare one word document (see template attached to podcast dropboxes) that includes the best “first post” and the best “second post” from the discussion board based on the 5-star ratings.</li><li>Groups are allowed to modify and make improvements on the best first post and the best second post, before submitting to the dropbox. One group member <strong>submits the document to the dropbox</strong> on LEARN.</li></ul><p>In the case of medical emergencies, any extenuating circumstances, self-declaration of short-term illness or public health event requiring an absence due to illness or a requirement to self-isolate <u>must be submitted before the access to the discussions closes and must cover the duration of the 5 full days that the discussions are open. </u> Students must upload their completed VIF forms to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances"><u>Accommodations for illness or extenuating circumstances page</u></a> covering the 5 full days while the discussions are open. Sending VIF after discussions close or at the end of the term trying to cover missed discussion boards is not accepted.</p><p>If your excuse satisfies the above criteria, the missed discussion board's mark will be entered as the average of the other four discussion boards' marks. For example, if discussion board 2 is missed due to approved reasons as stated above, discussion 2's mark will be equal to (discussion 1 mark + discussion 3 mark + discussion 4 mark + discussion 5 mark) / 4. </p><p>In the cases of missing more than one discussion board with approved reasons as stated above, the weight of missed discussion boards will be shifted to the ones that are completed. No shifting of the weight will be provided for students who miss more than two discussion boards. If a student has an ongoing medical issue over the long run that would cause missing more than two discussion boards, the student should bring official documentation stating their condition at the beginning of the term. No excuses are accepted at the end of the term to cover missed deadlines. There is no shifting of the weight from discussion boards to group work components or to quizzes. It is not possible to make arrangements at the end of the term by bringing medical notes to cover missed deadlines. </p><h4>Contribution Issues in Group Project</h4><p>Groups are expected to work with collaboration. Groups with less than 4 members will be given the option of resolving the group and joining existent groups with less than 6 members, if any. Communication among the group members is the key to efficient group work. Groups are asked to make their own group contract at the beginning of the term outlining the rules within their group. Moreover, students are asked to submit anonymous peer evaluations on PeerScholar after each group submission, which allows the instructor to keep track of everyone's contributions. Students must submit peer feedback, and read/reflect on the feedback they receive from their peers. In the case of contribution issues, non-contributor's marks will be penalized based on their peer evaluation scores. Instructor does not enter peer evaluations on behalf of students. It is students responsibility to submit their peer evaluations, communicate well with their peers and improve their peer rankings if there are any issues. Instructor will be involved in the cases where the group is unable to move forward based on the rules of their group contract and cannot resolve the persistent issues within the group. Peer evaluations and feedback submitted to PeerScholar will be considered as the official peer rating score for each group member in marketing plan project and will be used for applying penalties to non-contributors. </p><p>Students cannot use self declaration of illness for group project deadlines. In the case of illness or emergencies, students are responsible for contacting their group members <strong>ahead of deadlines</strong> and arranging for re-distribution of their responsibilities. Contacting your group members at the day of or the day before the deadline is not accepted. Groups will not be given extensions on the deadlines due to group members' self declaration of illness.  If a student is unable to contribute their fair share due to illness or an emergency situation and notifies their peers ahead of deadlines, their work will be covered by other group members and the student will contribute more work in the next submission. If the student fails to notify their peers, the student will receive penalty in group work based on their peer evaluation rankings. </p><h4>Late Group Project Submissions</h4><p>For late submissions, 1% late penalty per hour will apply. No component of the assignment will be accepted after 3 days of the due date. </p><h4>Course Modification Warning</h4><p>The instructor and university reserve the right to modify elements of the course during the term. The university may change the dates and deadlines for any or all courses in extreme circumstances. If either type of modification becomes necessary, reasonable notice and communication with students will be given with explanation and the opportunity to comment on changes. It is the responsibility of the student to check his/her UWaterloo email and course website daily during the term and to note any changes.</p><h4>The use of generative AI is not permitted in this course</h4><p>The use of generative AI is not permitted in this course. Students must create their own work and not fabricate, falsify, or use others’ work or AI produced work as if its their own. Using ChatGPT (or similar tools that generate text, code, or visual images) for content generation and submitting it as one’s own original work is a violation of the University of Waterloo’s Student Discipline Policy. </p><p>This course includes the development and practice of specific skills, such as collecting, synthesizing and analyzing information, creating recommendations and practicing writing skills. Therefore, the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of your work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations will be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>Copyright at Waterloo</u></a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p> </p>

<div>
<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken.
