  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<ol><li>Students who are interested in the Chinese language courses should be aware that the completion of at least three courses in a subject is recommended for a minimum working knowledge of the language. The Chinese and East Asian culture courses may provide useful background for students intending to spend time in the Far East.</li><li>Students who have previous experience with or who have studied the Chinese language at the elementary or secondary school level should not enrol in first-year level courses of the same language. Such students should consult the Renison Registrar's Office regarding the appropriate level to enter.</li><li>Two tracks of introductory courses are offered. CHINA 101R and 102R are sequenced courses at that beginner level designed for complete beginners who have little or no background in Chinese. CHINA 120R is designed for advanced beginners who have some Chinese background either in speaking or writing Chinese characters. The pinyin system of pronunciation and simplified form of Chinese characters are used in all the Chinese courses offered.</li><li>Students seeking entry into Chinese courses who have not previously taken a course in Chinese at Renison University College must complete a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/renison/current-students/printable-forms">Placement Application Form</a>. Renison reserves the right to allocate students to the appropriate class based on this assessment.</li><li>Students are normally not permitted to enroll in more than one Chinese language course at the same time. Special requests should be approved by the Chinese language coordinator.</li><li>Renison University College reserves the right to refuse admission to, and/or credit for, any of its language courses to a student who has, in Renison's view, a level of competence unsuited to the course(s).</li></ol><p> </p>

Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests.

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
