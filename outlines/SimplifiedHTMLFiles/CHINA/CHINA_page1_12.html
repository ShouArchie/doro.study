  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Late Submission of Homework</strong></p><p>Students should make every effort to submit their assignments on time. Late submissions will incur a cumulative deduction of 5% per day, including weekends. If a student anticipates a conflict with a deadline or has concerns about completing an assignment, they should contact the instructor as soon as possible. All homework must be submitted to the designated LEARN Dropbox as instructed. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Policy on Plagiarism </strong></p><p>“Policy 71’s glossary defines plagiarism, in part, as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others (whether attributed or anonymous) as one’s own in any work submitted whether or not for grading purposes”…</p><p>The Vice-President Academic and Dean has the authority to assess instances of plagiarism and the resultant penalties that are raised by an instructor. An instructor can propose a grade penalty to the Vice-President Academic and Dean, who will decide whether to accept the penalty or initiate a formal inquiry.”</p><p>For additional information on how plagiarism is dealt with at Renison, review the policy from where the above text is copied: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 - Student Discipline</a>.</p><p>Students should also be aware that copyright laws in Canada prohibit reproducing more than 10% of any work without permission from its author, publisher, or other copyright holder. See Waterloo’s policy on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/fair-dealing-advisory">Fair Dealing</a>.  Violation of Canada’s Copyright Act is a punishable academic offence under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 – Student Discipline</a>.</p><p><strong>Electronic Device Policy</strong></p><p>Students who choose to use electronic devices to support their learning may do so provided that the individuals in the class are not disturbed or prohibited from their own learning. Electronic devices should be used for the purposes of supplementing the learning experience and focus on topics being discussed in class. Phones should be kept on silent during the class.</p><p><strong>Attendance Policy</strong></p><p>Student should make every effort to attend each class and class component as scheduled. If a student is aware of an upcoming absence, the student should inform the instructor as soon as possible after the realization.</p><p><strong>Communication Policy</strong></p><p>Email, using the uWaterloo provided email address, is the approved method of communication for Renison. The Office 365 email that you use to login using your WatIAM login and password is secure and confidential. Take caution when forwarding your WatIAM email to an external email service as confidential information forwarded to a third-party provider could be a data security breach and violation of FIPPA (Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act) under which all students, staff, and faculty are bound by law.</p><p><strong>Final Examination Policy</strong></p><p>For <strong>Winter 2025</strong>, the established examination period is <strong>Apr 9 – 26 .</strong> The schedule will be available early October. Students should be aware that student travel plans are not acceptable grounds for granting an alternative final examination time. See the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/exam-schedule">Final Examination Schedule</a>.</p><p><strong>Accommodation for Illness or Unforeseen Circumstances</strong></p><p>The instructor follows the practices of the University of Waterloo in accommodating students who have documented reasons for missing quizzes or exams. See <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/accommodation-due-to-illness">Accommodation due to illness</a>. </p><p><strong>Accommodation Due to Religious Observances</strong></p><p>The University acknowledges that, due to the pluralistic nature of the University community, some students may seek accommodations on religious grounds. Accordingly, students must consult with their instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought. Failure to provide a timely request will decrease the likelihood of providing an accommodation. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/important-dates/2023-2024/requests-accommodations-religious-grounds-due">See Request for accommodation on religious grounds.</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Academic Integrity, Grievance, Discipline, Appeals and Note for Students with Disabilities</strong></p><p><i><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong></i><strong> </strong>To maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. See the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">UWaterloo Academic Integrity </a> and the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/academic-standing-understanding-your-unofficial-transcript/ethical-behaviour">Arts Academic Integrity </a> websites for more information. </p><p>Renison University College is committed to the view that when a problem or disagreement arises between a faculty member and a student every effort should be made to resolve the problem through mutual and respectful negotiation. Most issues are resolved by a student/faculty meeting to discuss differences of opinion. It is only after this stage, when a common understanding or agreement is not obtained that further actions listed below could be taken.</p><p><i><strong>Discipline:</strong></i> Every student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offences, and to take responsibility for their own actions. [Check the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">Office of Academic Integrity</a> website for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration, should seek guidance from the course professor or academic advisor. When misconduct has been found to have occurred, disciplinary penalties are imposed under the University of Waterloo <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 – Student Discipline</a>. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 - Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties check the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p><p><i><strong>Grievance:</strong></i><strong> </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the Department’s administrative assistant, or Academic Advisor, who will provide further assistance.</p><p><i><strong>Appeals:</strong></i><strong> </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a><u>.</u></p><p><i><strong>Academic Integrity Office (UWaterloo): </strong></i>The website can be found at <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/</a></p><p><strong>Accommodation for Students with Disabilities</strong></p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a> is located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, and collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p><p>Students are encouraged to register with AccessAbility Services (AAS) at the start of each term if they require accommodations due to a disability. However, some students not connected to AAS may require accommodations later in the term. In that case, you should immediately consult with your instructor and/or your Academic Advisor.</p><p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of the instructor, which can include:</p><ul><li>lecture handouts and presentations (e.g., PowerPoint slides)</li><li>lecture content, both spoken and written (and any audio or video recording thereof)</li><li>questions from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams)</li><li>work protected by copyright (i.e., any work authored by the instructor)  </li></ul><p>Making available the intellectual property of instructors without their express written consent (e.g., uploading lecture notes or assignments to an online repository) is considered theft of intellectual property and subject to disciplinary sanctions as described in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 – Student Discipline</a>. Students who become aware of the availability of what may be their instructor’s intellectual property in online repositories are encouraged to alert the instructor.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Mental Health Support</strong></p><p>All of us need a support system.
