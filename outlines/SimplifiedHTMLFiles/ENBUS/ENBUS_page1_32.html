<div>
<div>
<div>ENBUS 690A:</div>
<p>The capstone class synthesizes the learning in the program into a research project. Students show original application of the knowledge they have learned and reflect on the utility of the frameworks and tools using a case study approach. After learning relevant research methods, student teams develop a proposal on a research project which meets the needs of their live case study (i.e. the company or other organization which has committed to be the case in the research project). This proposal includes a review of the relevant literature, the methodology and project timeline. Where applicable, students obtain ethics approval for their research project. Each field study includes conducting a situation analysis, developing a sustainability strategic plan for the organization. A Faculty member assists each team. Students deliver field study project results as a report to both the organization and the course instructor. Individual students also complete a short reflection paper including a discussion of the case in relation to the application of sustainability frameworks and literature.</p>

<h3>Description</h3><p>This capstone course synthesizes the learning in the MEB program into a research project addressing a sustainability problem for a client. Student teams design the project to contribute to existing knowledge on the problem, as well as meet the needs of the client organization, which has committed to work with the team.</p><p>The first stage of the project consists of describing the project purpose by developing research questions, defining the project scope, reviewing relevant literature, and developing a methodological approach. Students will also complete a mandatory ethics tutorial and application before proceeding to the data collection phase of their project.</p><p>Having completed this initial stage, student teams will then apply their business sustainability and management skills to the problem. Each research project will be different but most involve conducting a situation analysis, gathering and analyzing primary data, identifying the financial implications, developing alternatives for the organization, assessing them against criteria, and recommending a course of action. Students are expected to demonstrate and build their personal and team management skills.</p><p>Teams deliver their research project results as a research report and in a presentation made during the final capstone weekend. Students also complete an individual paper on their research project.</p>

<p>These assignments build on one another in a cumulative manner. Each component must be completed to the satisfaction of the course instructor in order for the student group to proceed with the next stage of their project. Detailed expectations and criteria for meeting these expectations can be found on the assignment description pages.</p><p>The capstone as a whole will be assessed on a pass/fail basis. All students that complete the required elements and meet the basic standards for each of the course components will have passed. A basic standard for the final sustainability report is that it must demonstrate a broader applicability beyond the client organization and address potential financial implications of the situation/topic studied.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: There are also some ungraded activities and assignments in the course that contribute to the completion of the graded assignments and the course overall.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Late Policy</h3><p>All assignments are due on the date and time indicated. Late assignments (without penalty) are permitted only when specifically allowed by the instructor. Permission may be obtained in advance for late assignments (with no penalty), but this must occur by email at least 3 days PRIOR to the assignment deadline.</p><h3>Citation Style</h3><p>Please note that all Master of Environment and Business courses use the 6th edition of the American Psychological Association (APA) style guide.</p><p><strong>Research Ethics:</strong> The University of Waterloo requires all research conducted by its students, staff, and faculty which involves humans as participants to undergo prior ethics review and clearance through the Director, Office of Human Research and Animal Care (Office). The ethics review and clearance processes are intended to ensure that projects comply with the Office’s Guidelines for Research with Human Participants (Guidelines) as well as those of provincial and federal agencies, and that the safety, rights and welfare of participants are adequately protected. The Guidelines inform researchers about ethical issues and procedures which are of concern when conducting research with humans (e.g. confidentiality, risks and benefits, informed consent process, etc.). If the development of your research proposal consists of research that involves humans as participants, the please contact the course instructor for guidance and see: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics</u></a></p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>.

However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples.
