<p>This course reviews the history and issues of environmental finance. In addition to specific knowledge on environmental finance and banking, the course also offers insight into general banking and finance issues. Environmental finance is generally defined in a broader context of sustainability that integrates environmental as well as social and economic issues. Environmental finance is split into two main parts: the relation between sustainability performance and financial performance of corporations on one hand, and environmental banking and financial services on the other. After introducing environmental finance, the basics of banking and finance will be looked at. The course will cover actual environmental business indicators. These indicators are a prerequisite to understanding the interaction between sustainability performance and financial performance. The course will also look at the relation between sustainability performance and financial performance of corporations with regard to carbon finance. The motivations of banks and financial institutions to go green and the impact of these institutions on the environment will be an area of focus. The course also examines sustainable financial products and services like savings, loans and mortgages, socially responsible investments and sustainability indices, project finance, carbon finance products, and microfinance.</p>

<h2>General Information about Academic Integrity</h2><h3>PARAPHRASING AND QUOTES</h3><p>There are many types of essays, but a good essay generally has some academic support through the use of research. It is quite acceptable to paraphrase scholars’ work and in some cases to quote that work, but regardless of how you use that work, it all must be properly cited. If you do not cite someone else’s work you are plagiarizing.</p><h3>CITATION STYLE GUIDES</h3><p>There are many different citation styles, but they share common information. Citations are intended to guide the writer/ reader to the sources that were used and to give credit to the author of the quote or ideas summarized in an assignment or paper. Information on specific style guides is available from the Waterloo Library's <a href="https://lib.uwaterloo.ca/web/dictionaries-encyclopedia-and-more/citation-style-guides"><u>Citation / Style Guides</u></a>.</p><p>The MEB and SUSM programs use the APA style guide.</p><h3>ONLINE CITATION TOOLS</h3><p>Many online tools help you to capture the information you need in order to cite your sources properly. The library has the licensing rights to <a href="http://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/refworks"><u>RefWorks®</u></a> along with a tutorial. Other tools found online include: <a href="http://citationmachine.net/"><u>Citation Machine</u></a>, <a href="https://www.zotero.org/"><u>Zotero</u></a>, or <a href="http://www.easybib.com/"><u>Easy Bib</u></a>.</p><h3>USING PICTURES, TABLES, GRAPHS ETC.</h3><p>Graphics, figures, tables and graphs that have not been created by you all need to be cited. If you have modified something created by someone else, you also need to cite it. Contrary to popular belief, just because it is posted on the Internet it is not “free”. If you use the material, even with proper citation, you might be committing a copyright infringement.</p><h3>GENERAL WRITING GUIDE</h3><p>Writing well generally takes practice. The Waterloo Library has <a href="https://lib.uwaterloo.ca/web/dictionaries-encyclopedia-and-more/writing-assistance"><u>Writing Assistance</u></a> resources to help you improve your writing. </p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
