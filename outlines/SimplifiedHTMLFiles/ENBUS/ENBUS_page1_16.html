  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ENBUS 405:</div>
<p>This course builds students' technical competencies in life cycle assessment (LCA) and in critical analysis of products' environmental impacts through an understanding of life cycle management. Course content covers the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) life-cycle assessment framework, how to conduct technical LCA (including applying quantitative approaches using LCA software and databases, as available and appropriate), challenges of application of LCA to a range of product systems, limitations of LCA, and product life cycle management concepts for business and policy decisions. Students will use the knowledge gained to conduct their own technical LCA.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
</p>
<div>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h2>Policy on Late Submissions </h2><p><strong>I do not allow late submissions without penalty, unless you have compassionate grounds for lateness. </strong>Should you not be able to meet a deadline due to compassionate reasons (e.g. illness or death in the family), you must try to contact me and let me know BEFORE the deadline, or as soon as possible thereafter. It is unacceptable to wait to contact me more than a couple of days after a deadline. In the event you require an extension due to compassionate reasons, you may <strong>be asked for documentation</strong>, unless you have declared an absence. Technology failures are NOT acceptable reasons for lateness. <strong> </strong></p><p>Submissions are due by the times and dates indicated. Submissions received after this time will be penalized 5 per cent per day, or any part thereof, including weekends (i.e. 5% of an assignment that is worth 10% of your course grade would be penalized 0.5% of your final grade per day). Only in exceptional cases will this penalty be waived!   </p><h4>Policy on Remarking of Assignments</h4><p>If you feel a mistake has been made in marking on assignments you can request a remark <strong>within 1 week of your grade being posted on LEARN</strong>.</p><p>For remarking:</p><p>In an email, using the subject line "Assignment name"- Remarking request, provide us with the reason for the specific request for remarking. In the email, you must specify the sections you want addressed, a rationale for why it deserves consideration, with specific reference to the rubric and assessment criteria. General requests for remarking are not acceptable. We will <strong>remark the entire submitted work</strong> for consistency with the rubric, with special attention to the specific request noted by the student. The mark <strong>may increase or decrease as a result.</strong></p><h2>Lecture Attendance and In-class Assignments </h2><p><i><strong>You are responsible</strong></i> for attending all lectures or getting notes and information from your peers if you miss a lecture. I will not provide individuals with course notes, information that was provided in class, etc. If you miss an in-class assignment, you will get 0 unless there are extenuating circumstances. It is <i><strong>your responsibility</strong></i> to contact me as soon as possible in this situation.  </p><h3>Learn </h3><p>I will be using Learn online for this course. The course website will be the PRIMARY mode of communication for this course. Please ensure that you check this website regularly for announcements and other material that may be added from time to time. You will also be posting in-class assignments to Learn, where appropriate. It is your responsibility to ensure that your Learn email address is kept up to date in case I need to send you a message individually.<strong> </strong>Unless otherwise noted on the Assignment outline, all assignments must be <strong><u>submitted electronically to Learn</u></strong> by the indicated deadline. Any handouts as well as lecture notes that are important will also be added to the website throughout the semester. <strong><u>Detailed descriptions of the requirements for each assignment are also placed on</u> <u>Learn.</u> </strong></p><h2>Policy on Use of Electronics and Electronic Media in Class </h2><h3>Laptop use in-class </h3><p>Laptops are permitted in class for <strong>course-related purposes only. You will need a laptop (or calculator) in most classes for in-class assignments. While I encourage the use of laptops in this course,</strong> I request that you have a sense of <i><strong>courtesy and respect</strong></i> and do not misuse the computer in class. Anybody found accessing the internet for other purposes (e.g. checking email, chatting, Facebook, non-course sites, playing on-line games, etc.), or using laptops off-line for non-course purposes (e.g. games, movies, music), <strong>will be asked to leave the class</strong>. I also refer you to university policy: </p><p>University Policy 33 ("Ethical Behaviour") states that "no member of the University community (faculty, staff, student) may unduly interfere with the study, work or working environment of other members of the University or any aspect of another's University activity." The policy adds that "A 'poisoned environment' (or one that is intimidating, hostile or offensive) can be created based on any of the prohibited grounds under the Ontario Human Rights Code, and can be described as comment or conduct that is contrary to the aims of maintaining a supportive, respectful and tolerant environment." Using a laptop to view potentially offensive or inappropriate images during class could certainly contravene this policy, and an instructor would therefore have the responsibility to direct a student to refrain from this activity during class. Similarly, if a student is using a laptop in class to view material that is not offensive per se but merely distracting to others -- for example, a video of a high-speed car-chase -- it might reasonably be deemed to "interfere with the study, work or working environment of other members" of the class. </p><p>I may ask that you close your laptops for short times during certain activities, such as during a small group discussion. </p><h2>Unclaimed assignments </h2><p>Unclaimed assignments (those submitted as a hard copy) will be retained until one month after term grades become official in Quest.  After that time, they will be destroyed in compliance with UW’s confidential shredding procedures. </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>. The following text is recommended:<br/><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p><strong>Research Ethics:</strong> The University of Waterloo requires all research conducted by its students, staff, and faculty which involves humans as participants to undergo prior ethics review and clearance through the Director, Office of Human Research and Animal Care (Office). The ethics review and clearance processes are intended to ensure that projects comply with the Office’s Guidelines for Research with Human Participants (Guidelines) as well as those of provincial and federal agencies, and that the safety, rights and welfare of participants are adequately protected. The Guidelines inform researchers about ethical issues and procedures which are of concern when conducting research with humans (e.g. confidentiality, risks and benefits, informed consent process, etc.). If the development of your research proposal consists of research that involves humans as participants, the please contact the course instructor for guidance and see: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics</u></a></p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/ about/equity-office3 </p><p><strong>Declaring an absence: </strong>Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, instructors maintain agency over decisions regarding course component accommodations.  </p><p>Self-declared absences (for flu-like illness, short-term 48 hour self declared absences) must be submitted through Quest.</p><p>Absences requiring documentation (e.g. Verification of Illness Form, bereavement, etc.) - send your documentation to env-vif@uwaterloo. Do not send documentation to your advisor, course instructor, teaching assistant, or lab coordinator. Submission to env-vif@uwaterloo.ca<a href=""> </a>will notify all of your instructors of your absence. Students taking courses in Arts that require accommodation, should reach out to those instructors independently.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, data analysis and interpretation, and communication skills.  (see Skills employees look for https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/soft-skills-examples/#11_essential_soft_skills_that_employers_value_section). It is increasingly a competitive world, where these skills are more and more valued. Anyone can use AI, but not everyone has the soft and technical skills to succeed in today's world. </p><p>Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
