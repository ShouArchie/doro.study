  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ENBUS 410:</div>
<p>Business practices need to reflect responsibility not just to shareholders, customers and staff, but also towards the local community. This course discusses what this means for management, and the strategies and practices that are needed to express this responsibility successfully.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the role of corporations has been narrowly defined as a source of value creation for shareholders through the efficient use of resources and production of goods and services. Governments are responsible for ensuring that this value creation does not generate any unwelcome costs for society. Civil society actors work to hold corporations and governments accountable for actions that contribute to social harm. These distinctions are increasingly a point of contestation as corporate corruption, environmental degradation and social inequality question whether corporate value creation should reflect the interests of a broader group of stakeholders.  In response, pluralities of different stakeholder relationships and partnerships have emerged between corporations, governments, and civil society organizations. These interactions constitute a new era and approach to corporate governance. Stakeholder engagement is not just an approach used by businesses; it is used by all organizational types, from government to civil society organizations. The purpose of this course is to explore stakeholder engagement theory and practice. </p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
