<p>This course focuses on managerial decisions and actions related to strategic management with emphasis on sustainable enterprises. Following a typical strategic management cycle (or process), we review managerial decisions related to environmental scanning, strategy formulation, strategy implementation, and evaluation and control. We use recent business reports and case studies to apply these concepts. We will illustrate where relevant using the successes and failures of businesses which have attempted to adopt sustainability principles in their strategies and practices.</p>

<h3>Policy on Late Submissions</h3><p>Late assignments will be penalized 10% of the total possible grade per day, starting 30 mins after the due date and time. After 96 hours (4 days), the assignment will receive a grade of zero. Exceptions will be made in (very) extraordinary circumstances (usually related to medical emergencies supported by documentation). <strong>Students anticipating that their assignment will be submitted late are encouraged to contact me earlier rather than later. </strong></p><p><strong>For individual submissions (i.e., case responses), each of you will receive a total of 2 'grace days'. A grade day provides a 24-hour extension on the individual submission. You can use both grace days on one submissions or on two separate submissions. If you're electing to use one or both of your grace days, please note it in your submission while submitting on LEARN. Grace days can not be retroactively re-allocated. </strong></p><p>It is the student’s responsibility that digital submissions are not corrupt partially or fully (i.e., submissions can be opened and viewed by the teaching team). Re-submissions because of corrupt files will be graded as late. <strong>It is strongly recommended that after submitting to the LEARN dropbox, open the file on LEARN to ensure that the submission is not corrupt.</strong>  </p><h3>Note on Digital Submissions</h3><p>Please submit your assignments to the appropriate dropboxes on LEARN in the file format as instructed. Some other guidelines on digital submissions:</p><ul><li>please do not submit a ‘zip’ file.</li><li>ensure your file is not corrupt (I know this is one of those ‘strategies’ used in hopes of getting an extension, but it isn’t a good one). If your submission is corrupt, I’ll reach out to you and your re-submission will be subject to the course late policy. You can check if your submission is corrupt by submitting your assignment, and then downloading the file again from LEARN.</li><li>You can submit as many copies of your submission as you’d like. The TAs and I will grade the most recently submitted file(s).</li><li>By submitting to the LEARN dropbox, you are agreeing that all ideas that are not yours are properly referenced, and the assignment was completed either by your own efforts or group efforts (depending on the particular assignment).</li><li>This is the first time you have submitted this assignment, in part or in full, for academic evaluation at the University of Waterloo or any other academic institution.</li><li>With a successful submission of a file, you will receive a LEARN email notification. Please keep these in case there is a situation we have to refer to them.</li></ul><h3>Group-work</h3><p>This course will have students working in small groups in the Strategy Assignment. Thereby, group-work is required. To encourage reasonable fair distribution of work among groups, a group contract, peer-review, and group contribution form (for each submission) will be required. </p><p>No group work will be permitted during midterms and the final exam. </p><h3>Protocol for Contesting Graded Assignments</h3><p>Upon receipt of your graded assignment, should you wish to contest the grading of your assignment (outside of simple errors in the addition of marks) the following protocol should be followed:</p><ol><li>Read comments provided thoroughly.</li><li>After 24 hours, submit an email to me detailing why your assignment warrants a review. Please be sure to provide specific examples and justification as to why you feel your grade should be reconsidered. Be sure to include a copy of your graded assignment in the email.</li><li>I will then review the stated reasons and decide whether re-grading of the full assignment is warranted.</li><li>Should I deem that re-grading is warranted, I will then ask you whether you would like your assignment re-graded, recognizing that your grade could go up or down depending on the my re-assessment.</li><li>You can choose to either have the entire submission re-assessed or keep the original grade.</li></ol><h3>Missing the midterm for a valid reason </h3><p>See below for the types of valid reasons. In the event that you have to miss the midterm on Feb. 10th, the grade weighting will be shifted to the final exam. </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. In submitted assignments or parts of the group project, <strong>EVERY reference will be checked to ensure it has not been falsified</strong>. </p><p>GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong>: The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their website: › uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office</p><p><strong>Co-op interviews and class attendance:</strong> Co-op students are encouraged to try and choose interview time slots that result in the least amount of disruption to class schedules. When this is challenging, or not possible, a student may miss a portion of a class meeting for an interview. Instructors are asked for leniency in these situations; but, a co-op interview does not relieve the student of any requirements associated with that class meeting.<br/><br/>When a co-op interview conflicts with an in-class evaluation mechanism (e.g., test, quiz, presentation, critique), class attendance takes precedence and the onus is on the student to reschedule the interview. CEE provides an interview conflict procedure to manage these situations.<br/><br/>Students will be required to provide copies of their interview schedules (they may be printed from WaterlooWorks) should there be a need to verify class absence due to co-op interviews. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> For further information on IP related to teaching, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/legal-and-immigration-services/sites/ca.legal-and-immigration-services/files/uploads/files/volume_1_issue_3_winter_2018.pdf</u></a> and the Guidelines for Faculty, Staff and Students Entering Relationships with External Organizations Offering Access to Course Materials, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external</u></a>. The following text is recommended:<br/><br/>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:<br/><br/>-Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);<br/>-Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);<br/>-Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and<br/>-Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).<br/><br/>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Research Ethics:</strong> The University of Waterloo requires all research conducted by its students, staff, and faculty which involves humans as participants to undergo prior ethics review and clearance through the Director, Office of Human Research and Animal Care (Office). The ethics review and clearance processes are intended to ensure that projects comply with the Office’s Guidelines for Research with Human Participants (Guidelines) as well as those of provincial and federal agencies, and that the safety, rights and welfare of participants are adequately protected. The Guidelines inform researchers about ethical issues and procedures which are of concern when conducting research with humans (e.g. confidentiality, risks and benefits, informed consent process, etc.). If the development of your research proposal consists of research that involves humans as participants, the please contact the course instructor for guidance and see: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics</u></a></p><p>If you have read up to this point in the course outline, please email me a photo of your favourite cartoon character and I'll award you a bonus point on the midterm or final exam.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
