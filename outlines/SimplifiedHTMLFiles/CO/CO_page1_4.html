<p>Suppose that the owner of a factory wants to maximize its production for the next 30 days. There is a limit on the resources available. Resources may include raw materials, labour, machine capacities, etc. This is an example of an optimization problem. The function that we are trying to maximize is the <i>objective function</i>, and the conditions imposed by the available resources are the <i>constraints </i>of the problem. Optimization problems are classified according to the type of objective function and the type of constraints.</p><p>One of the simpler mathematical models is the <i>Linear Programming Problem</i>, where both the constraints and the objective functions are linear combinations of the variables plus a constant. Even though this may appear at a first glance to be overly restrictive, linear programming algorithms are incredibly important in practice. Indeed, a survey of Fortune 500 companies shows that 85% of all respondents use such algorithms in their operations. </p><p>It is not hard however, to imagine applications for which fractional variable values are not desirable. For instance a variable may indicate the number of employees to hire, or a variable may be restricted to values 0 or 1 to indicate one of two possible options (e.g., build a factory in Waterloo or not). In these cases, we would like to add the condition that some variables in our linear programming problem take only integer values. These mathematical models are known as <i>Integer Programming Problems</i>. Finally, in certain instances, such as portfolio optimization (in financial mathematics), the natural way of formulating the optimization problem may require the use of nonlinear functions in the constraints or objective function. This leads to the <i>Nonlinear Programming </i>model.</p><p>The applications of Optimization are not restricted to problems of business. The same techniques have been very successful in Engineering as well as in Physical and Social Sciences. The theory of optimization is used in mathematical research in many other mathematical research areas to lead to new computational advances, to discover and prove new theorems, and to discover and design new algorithms.</p><p>In the first part of the course, we will illustrate these various models with examples that arise from real problems. The later part of the course addresses the subject of how to solve the aforementioned problems. The <i>Simplex Method </i>to solve Linear Programming problems will be discussed in some detail. And general-purpose Integer Programming techniques such as <i>Branch-and-Bound </i>and <i>Cutting Planes </i>will also be described. These algorithms, while guaranteed to terminate, may in the worst case (and often do in practice) take a prohibitively long time. No asymptotically fast general algorithm is known for integer programs and none is believed to exist. However, there are efficient algorithms for many important special cases such as the <i>Maximum Weight Matching </i>problem. An indispensable tool for the design of such fast algorithms is the <i>Theory of Duality</i>, which will be a main focus of this course.</p><p>In the concluding part of the course, we include a review of the various techniques used to solve linear and integer programs, and provide a geometric interpretation of these algorithms. This discussion leads us to nonlinear convex optimization problems.</p>

<p> </p><h4>Assignments</h4><p>There are 9 assignments in this course. They are usually due on Fridays at 11:59pm EDT (see schedule above). We will be using the Crowdmark system for submitting assignment problems online. Your submission must be clear and legible, and in the correct orientation. You need to submit your solutions to the correct problems, otherwise it will not be marked. Late submissions will receive a mark deduction of 5% for every (full or partial) hour late (up to 100%).</p><p>The first assignment is for review only; it will be marked, but will not be counted towards your grade. Your total grade for assignments will be based on the best 6 of the 8 other assignments. A missed assignment will be treated the same as a mark of zero.</p><p>Assignments are intended as <strong>primarily a learning aid </strong>rather than a means of assessment. You should take them seriously and focus more on your understanding of the content than matters of grading. </p><p>You are expected to do the assignments on your own. The ONLY sources allowed for doing the assignments are:</p><ul><li>all of the material on the CO 250 W25 course website,</li><li>the textbook,</li><li>all of the material on the CO 250 W25 Piazza website,</li><li>your Instructors and TAs.</li></ul><p>Usage of any other source (dead, alive or online) in doing the homework assignments is against the academic integrity rules for CO 250 in the W25 term.</p><p>Teaching staff for the course actively look for evidence of academic offences when evaluating assignment submissions. By policy, academic integrity violations by a student in assignments will result in a mark of zero in that assignment and likely will lead to a 5% deduction from the Final Course Grade. In addition, all academic offences are reported to the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies and are recorded in the student’s file (this may lead to further, more severe consequences).</p><h4>Midterm</h4><p>The midterm will take place from 6-8PM on the evening of Tuesday, March 11. </p><h4>Final Exam</h4><p>The final exam will be comprehensive, and is scheduled by the Office of the Registrar later in the term. This is a closed-book exam. No aids are allowed.</p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Piazza</h4><p>We will be using Piazza to facilitate discussions during this course. The course staff will visit Piazza on a regular basis and will try to answer questions in a timely manner. Some general guidelines on Piazza posting:</p><ul><li>The aim is to create a positive learning environment for everyone. Please be professional and courteous.</li><li>For assignment problems, you can ask for clarifications, but do not post any full or partial solutions, nor any strong hints.</li><li>Private questions will be disabled - they should instead be asked by email. </li><li>Please put some thoughts into your questions and posts. You should show that you have worked on the problem in some way. A post similar to “I’m stuck, any hints?” is not appropriate and will not receive help.</li><li>You are encouraged to help each other and answer questions. For student answers that are correct and do not require additional clarification, the course staff will endorse them without making a further response.</li><li>Often the course staff do not give you a direct response to your question. Instead, we may ask a probing question that helps you discover or verify the answer on your own.</li></ul><h4>Re-marking policies</h4><p><strong>For assignments</strong>: If you believe that there are marking errors in your assignments and you would like to make a re-marking request, then you need to create a private Piazza post that includes your student ID and which assignment problem or which quiz that you want re-marked, with an explanation. You need to do this within one week of the date the assignment is marked and returned to you.</p><p>Note that your solution will be very carefully examined during a re-mark. So it is possible that your grade is reduced. Also, we cannot mark anything that is not in your submission. For example, if your solution has some missing details and you try to provide them in your request, we will not consider that. Generally, marks will only be increased if the original mark is unambiguously a <i>mistake </i>rather than an unfavourable judgement call.  </p><p><strong>For quizzes</strong>: Re-marking requests for quizzes can only be done while visiting your instructor during their office hours.</p><h4>INC policy</h4><p>In case of serious illness during the final exam, you may be granted a grade of INC provided that</p><ul><li>you have suitable medical documentation that you submit to the Math Undergraduate Office; and</li><li>you have passing grades for at least 4 assignments and at least 2 quizzes.</li></ul><p>Granting a grade of INC is at the discretion of your instructor.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as <strong>[fill this in with your discipline-specific skills]</strong>. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
