<p>Integer Programming is a mathematical program that can be seen as a linear program with the additional requirement that some (or all) of the variables are required to take on integer values. While linear programming is already very useful in modeling problems and can be solved well using either interior point methods or the simplex method, {\bf Integer programs, or IPs} have a much broader range of applications. Although no  method exists that can guarantee an efficient solution to ALL IPs, Integer Programming research has gone quite far in the past 60 years, to the point that some IPs can effectively be used as subroutines in more complex problems.</p><p>In this course we will explore an upper-level undergraduate/basic graduate introduction to the topic of Integer Programming. The focus will be on structural properties and ideas, with several proofs. Some ideas of algorithms that are useful to solve IPs in practice will also be presented, but will not be the main focus.</p><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Collaboration</h3><p><strong>For homework assignments:</strong></p><p>Students are allowed to collaborate with other classmates in the Winter 2025 offering of CO452/CO652. Note that such collaboration is limited to an exchange of ideas, and that each student is expected to write the solutions to their assignments on their own. For example, copying or paraphrasing a solution from some fellow student is considered cheating. You are also not allowed to consult any other material outside of the ones provided in the course website and the course textbooks. The TA’s will actively look for suspicious similarities and evidence of academic offenses when grading.</p><p><strong>For all other graded work:</strong></p><p>No collaboration/external source of help is allowed.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></p><p>All outside help and collaboration should be acknowledged, but there is no need to acknowledge help from course TAs/instructors or from the course material.</p><h4><strong>Piazza</strong></h4><p>We will be using Piazza to facilitate discussions during this course. The course staff will visit Piazza on a regular basis and will try to answer questions in a timely manner. Some general guidelines on Piazza posting:</p><ul><li>The aim is to create a positive learning environment for everyone. Please be professional and courteous.</li><li>For assignment problems, you can ask for clarifications, but do not post any full or partial solutions, nor any strong hints. If you have a specific question that include partial solutions to assignment problems, please use private posts.</li><li>Course staff may chose to turn private posts into public ones at their discretion so that the whole class may benefit from seeing it/the response to it (original poster will remain anonymous)</li><li>Please put some thoughts into your questions and posts. You should show that you have worked on the problem in some way. A post similar to “I’m stuck, any hints?” is not appropriate and will not receive help.</li><li>You are encouraged to help each other and answer questions. For student answers that are correct and do not require additional clarification, the course staff will endorse them without making a further response.</li><li>Often times the course staff do not give you a direct response to your question. Instead, we may ask a probing question that helps you discover or verify the answer on your own.</li><li>Piazza is supposed to be a forum for discussing course content ONLY. Posts that relate to discussing course policies or other matters that do not relate to the course will be deleted. Course policies can be discussed directly with the instructor in person.</li></ul><h4><strong>Re-marking policies</strong></h4><p>If you believe that there are marking errors in your assignments or term tests and you would like to make a re-marking request, then you need to create a private Piazza post that includes your student ID and which assignment or test problem that you want re-marked, with an explanation. You are expected to have read and understood the official solutions before you post. You need to do this within one week of the date the assessment is marked and returned to you.</p><p>Note that your solution will be very carefully examined during a re-mark. So it is possible that your grade is reduced. Also, we cannot mark anything that is not in your submission. For example, if your solution has some missing details and you try to provide them in your request, we will not consider that. Moreover, complaints about the marking scheme itself is not a valid reason for adjusting marks. For example, say you think that one type of mistake leads to too many marks being taken off. As long as this is consistently applied to all students, then it is not a marking error.</p><h4><strong>INC policy</strong></h4><p>A grade of INC will only be awarded to students who cannot write the final exam for exceptional and justifiable reasons. In addition such student needs to be in good standing. To be in good standing a student’s grades must be such that a passing grade (50%) in the final exam will result in a passing grade (50% or more) in the course. Moreover, the INC grade will not be granted for students that did not write the midterm.</p><h4><strong>Intellectual property</strong></h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4> </h4><h4> </h4><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as undertanding theory and algorithms for some classes of optimization models. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p>
