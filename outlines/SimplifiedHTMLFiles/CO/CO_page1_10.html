<ol><li>Assignments will be submitted via <strong>Crowdmark</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>assignments</strong> are equally weighted.</li><li>The two quizzes, which are in lieu of a midterm test, will be administered <strong>online</strong> on LEARN. The quizzes are each worth 7.5%, and can be taken between 8:00 am and 9:30 pm. The questions will be of the following kind: multiple choice, True/False, fill in the blanks, short answers. Both quizzes will be <strong>open book</strong>, but not open internet. Further instructions will be provided later in the course.</li><li><strong>The final exam will be held in-person.</strong> If you are taking on-campus courses, you will be scheduled to write the exam on-campus. Otherwise, you will need to make arrangements to write the exam at an exam centre or with a proctor. Please do this as soon as possible. In the "<strong>Exam Arrangements for Online Courses</strong>" section on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/academics/final-examinations">Final Examinations webpage</a>, you can find the information about your exam arrangements (including dates, exam centre locations, how to find a proctor and submit proctor information, etc.).</li><li>There is <strong>no requirement to pass the final exam</strong> in order to pass the course.</li></ol><p> </p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>SELF-DECLARED SHORT-TERM ABSENCE:</strong>  After completing the self‐declaration on Quest, send the instructor an email requesting accommodation for an assignment or quiz that is due during the two (2) day period of your absence. You can submit solutions to a subset of questions by the assignment due date. (I post solutions on LEARN shortly after the submission deadline, so extensions will not be granted.) The portion of your assignment grade for questions whose solutions you did not submit will be moved to the ﬁnal exam. The subset you submit must be comprised of solutions to full questions (not parts of questions), and need not be a proper subset. Your request should include the list of questions that you have elected not to submit.</p><p><strong>OFFICE HOURS: </strong>Please make use of TA and instructor office hours and Piazza throughout the semester. You can use the office hours for assignment questions as well as for questions about the lecture material.</p><p><strong>PIAZZA: </strong>You are encouraged to use Piazza to ask questions about the video lectures and to discuss the course material. You may ask for general clariﬁcation about assignment questions. However, please do not discuss solutions to assignment questions on Piazza, or make posts that reveal part of a solution. In particular, please do not ask for hints on Piazza. Instead, please see the instructor or one of the TA's during their oﬃce hours or make a private post on Piazza.</p><p><strong>EMAIL QUERIES: </strong>Please restrict your email queries to questions of a personal nature, and questions that have short (e.g., YES/NO) answers. Questions that may have longer answers are best handled during office hours or on Piazza.</p><p><strong>COLLABORATION ON ASSIGNMENTS: </strong><i>One question on each assignment will permit no collaboration of any kind; more details will be provided on the assignment.</i> For the remaining questions, you are welcome (and encouraged) to collaborate on assignments in groups of size at most five (5) with other students presently enrolled in CO 331. However, <i>solutions must be written up by yourself</i>. If you do collaborate, you must <i>acknowledge your collaborators</i> in the write-up for each problem. You are <i>not</i> permitted to solicit help from websites such as Course Hero and Chegg, online discussion groups including Discord, LLMs including ChatGPT, or solutions from previous offerings of the course.</p><p><strong>ASSIGNMENT DEADLINES: </strong>The material for each assignment problem will be covered well in advance of the assignment due date, so you will have adequate time to work on assignment problems. Late assignments will <i>not</i> be accepted except in <i>very</i> special circumstances (usually a documented illness of a serious nature). High workloads because of midterms and assignments in other courses will <i>not</i> qualify as a special circumstance.</p><p><strong>GRADE APPEALS: </strong>If you have any concerns with the marking of assignment questions, please email your instructor together with a <i>clear and detailed</i> description of your appeal(s). If your marked assignment was returned to you on day X, then you should email appeals to me by the end of day X + 7 (and no later). Solutions to assignments will be posted on the course website shortly after the assignment submission deadline.</p><p><strong>CONTINUITY PLANS: </strong>If an in-person final exam is not possible, the final exam will be held online using Crowdmark and LEARN.</p><p><strong>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:  </strong>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo.  Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience.  However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  Doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.  The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>DIVERSITY: </strong>It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, and that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class. We recognize the immense value of the diversity in identities, perspectives, and contributions that students bring, and the benefit it has on our educational environment.Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In particular:</p><ul><li>We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternate/preferred name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the semester so we may make appropriate changes to our records.</li><li>We will honour your religious holidays and celebrations. Please inform us of these at the start of the course.</li><li>We will follow AccessAbility Services guidelines and protocols on how to best support students with different learning needs.</li></ul><p> </p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
