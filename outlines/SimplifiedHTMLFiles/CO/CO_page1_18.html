<p>Cryptography is concerned with the mathematical, algorithmic, and implementational aspects of information security. It is one of the core technologies for securing the emerging information infrastructure. Its applications range from (conceptually) simple tasks such as encryption, authentication, and key management to sophisticated tasks such as Internet security, electronic cash payments, and electronic voting.</p><p>This course is a comprehensive introduction to modern cryptography that is aimed primarily at those interested in applications. The topics discussed will include an introduction to classical cryptography: encryption algorithms, hash functions, and message authentication codes. In the area of public-key cryptography, topics will include an overview of specific systems (Diffie–Hellman, RSA, DSA, etc.) and a few advanced protocols. The security of these schemes and the use of public-key techniques for generating digital signatures will be described. An emphasis will be placed on tools that are currently being used to secure the Internet and/or have broad social impacts.</p><p>Topics to be covered will be drawn from the following partial list.</p><ul><li><i>Symmetric-key encryption</i>: Classical ciphers, one-time pad, stream ciphers (RC4), Feistel networks, DES, AES, modes of operation. Linear and differential cryptanalysis of ciphers.</li><li><i>Hash functions and data integrity</i>: Hash functions (SHA-1, SHA-2), parallel collision search, message authentication codes (CBC-MAC, HMAC).</li><li><i>Authenticated encryption</i>: Encrypt-then-MAC, AES-GCM.</li><li><i>Public-key encryption</i>: RSA, ElGamal, elliptic curves, post-quantum.</li><li><i>Signature schemes</i>: RSA, DSA, ECDSA, post-quantum.</li><li><i>Key establishment</i>: Diffie–Hellman key exchange.</li><li><i>Key management</i>: Certification authorities, public-key infrastructures.</li><li><i>Deployed cryptography</i>: IEEE 802.11 WEP, IEEE 802.11 WPA2, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS), cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin), Fast IDentity Online (FIDO), end-to-end encrypted messaging (Signal, WhatsApp, iMessage), privacy-enhancing technologies (Tor, OTR), Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).</li></ul><p> </p>

<p>The material covered in this course is rather broad, and we will not have the chance to study any topic in great depth. The primary source of material is the lectures, and you are encouraged to attend all lectures.  While lectures will not be recorded, I will post the slides. This course is also based on previous offerings from Alfred Menezes, who has created a "Crypto 101" YouTube series about the topic, linked above.</p><p>The above book is a good source of supplementary information for the material covered in the lectures. I will provide suggestions for required, recommended and optional readings on LEARN. You are encouraged (but not required) to do the recommended readings in order to supplement the class notes. If you would like to learn more about a topic covered in class, please ask me to provide additional optional readings. <strong>For the final exam, you will be responsible for all material covered in the lectures indicated. You will not be responsible for recommended and optional readings.</strong></p><p><strong>Piazza</strong></p><p>Piazza is the primary medium for <strong>all questions</strong> related to the course, except for questions of a personal nature which can be sent to the instructor by email.  </p><p>The aim is to create a positive learning environment for everyone. Please be professional and courteous.</p><p>You should use Piazza for:</p><ul><li>Questions and discussion about lectures.  It is helpful if you label your post with the relevant lecture (1.0, 1.2, etc.) and slide number if appropriate.</li><li>For assignment problems, you can ask for clarifications, but do not post any full or partial solutions, nor any strong hints. If you have a specific question that include partial solutions to assignment problems, please use private posts.</li><li>Requesting a remark (private post; see instructions on Remarking Requests below).</li><li>Requesting an office-hours appointment (private post; see instructions on Office Hours below).</li></ul><p>Please put some thought into your questions and posts. You should show that you have worked on the problem in some way. A post of the form "I'm stuck, any hints?" is not appropriate.</p><p>You are encouraged to help each other and answer questions. For student answers that are correct and do not require additional clarification, the course staff will endorse them without making a further response. </p><p>We will aim to provide a response on Piazza with 12–24 hours, but response times on weekends/holidays may be longer.  TAs will be monitoring Piazza during scheduled times (which will be posted on Piazza).</p>

<h3><strong>Assignments</strong></h3><p>Assignments are due on Thursdays at 11:30 pm. Expected schedule of assignment due dates:<br/>A1: January 23<br/>A2: February 13<br/>A3: March 6<br/>A4: March 20<br/>A5: April 3<br/>Assignments will be submitted using Crowdmark. Further instructions will be included with Assignment #1.  Crowdmark submission links will be sent out approximately two weeks before the assignment deadline. <br/> </p><h3>Quizzes </h3><p>Quizzes will be short questions, frequently with some small programming aspect, submitted online through LEARN. </p><p>These will be due on Wednesdays at 11:30 pm, starting Jan 15 and ending Apr 2, with no quiz during reading week (Feb 19). </p><p>There will be unlimited attempts up to the due date, with your grade taken from the highest attempt. </p><p>Your final quiz grade will be the average of the top n-1 out of n quizzes.</p><p><strong>Academic integrity for assignments and quizzes: </strong></p><ul><li>For most questions on the assignments, you are welcome to collaborate on assignments with other students presently enrolled in the course this semester. However, <i>solutions must be written up by yourself</i>. If you do collaborate,  <i>you must acknowledge your collaborators in the write‐up for each problem</i>. If you obtain a solution with help from a book, research paper, a website, or elsewhere, <i>you must acknowledge your source</i>. <br/>You may ask for general clarification about assignment questions on Piazza. However, please do not discuss solutions to assignment questions on Piazza. Instead, please make a private post or ask for an office hours appointment.<br/>You are <strong>not</strong> permitted to solicit help from other online bulletin boards, chat groups, newsgroups, or solutions from previous oﬀerings of the course.</li><li>Some questions on an assignment may be flagged as "no collaboration".  This will be clearly indicated for each such question.  In that case you are required to work independently.</li></ul><h3><strong>Final exam</strong></h3><p>There will be an in-person final exam during the final exam period, scheduled by the Registrar.</p><p>This course is not a traditional textbook course. That is, lectures will not closely follow any textbook, and much of the material covered will not be testable. There are no good sources of practice problems, as a result of which the content of exams does not have a predictable pattern. In addition to technical questions, there will be  short-answer questions on exams that will require you to clearly and concisely explain some concepts. These questions will test your ability to identify the important concepts introduced in lectures, and your understanding of them. (In contrast, assignment questions will only cover the technical aspects of the course.)</p><h3><strong>Project – CO 687 students only</strong></h3><p>CO 687 students will have to complete a written report exploring a topic in cryptography in greater detail.  Details will be posted on LEARN. All project topics and formats must be approved in advanced, and should be cleared with me by reading week (February 17, 2025), though you are encouraged to do so earlier.  The deadline for the final report is April 4, submitted via LEARN.</p><h3><strong>Missing assignments: illness and self-declared short-term absences</strong></h3><p>All students have a 1-time, no questions asked, 72-hour extension they can apply to any assignment. To use this, please email me your name and student number and the assignment you want to use the extension for, and do so <strong>before</strong> the original due date. </p><p>If you submit a self-declared short-term absence form on Quest or a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations">Verification of Illness form</a> which covers the due date of an assignment, you may choose to have the deadline for the assignment extended by 72 hours, or choose to have the entire weight of that assignment transferred to the final exam.</p><p>After electronically submitting the self-declared short-term absence or VIF form, <strong>you must also notify me by email</strong> and (in the same email) specify whether you elect to have the deadline extended by 72 hours or have the weight transferred to the final.  The link for the CO 487/687 web form will be available on LEARN.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p><strong>Mental health support: </strong>All of us need a support system. We encourage you to seek out mental health support when they are needed. Please reach out to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Campus Wellness and Counselling Services.</a></p><p><strong>Diversity</strong>: It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, and that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class. We recognize the immense value of the diversity in identities, perspectives, and contributions that students bring, and the benefit it has on our educational environment. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In particular:</p><ul><li>We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternate/preferred name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the semester so we may make appropriate changes to our records.</li><li>We will honour your religious holidays and celebrations. Please inform us of these at the start of the course.</li><li>We will follow AccessAbility Services guidelines and protocols on how to best support students with different learning needs.</li></ul><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Cryptography requires caution and precision, which makes large language models particularly ill-suited for it. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
