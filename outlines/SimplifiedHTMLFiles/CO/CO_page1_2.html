<p>Suppose that the owner of a factory wants to maximize its production for the next 30 days. There is a limit on the resources available. Resources may include raw materials, labour, machine capacities, etc. This is an example of an optimization problem. We can describe the amount of production using a function. This is the function that we want to maximize, and it is called the objective function. The conditions imposed by the available resources are the constraints of the problem. This course will discuss optimization problems where the objective function and the constraints are linear.</p>

<h4><strong>ASSIGNMENTS</strong></h4><p>There are 8 assignments in this course, see schedule above. They are due at 11:59pm Waterloo time. We will be using the Crowdmark system for submitting assignment problems online. Your submission must be clear and legible, and in the correct orientation. You are expected to present your solution with explanations in complete sentences. A correct solution that is poorly presented may not receive full marks. You need to submit your solutions to the correct problems, otherwise it will not be marked. Late submissions will receive a mark deduction of 5% for every (full or partial) hour late (up to 100%). You are expected to upload your solutions well ahead of the submission deadline, in case of technical difficulty. If you encounter technical difficulties, as a last resort, you can email your solutions to the instructor before the deadline.</p><p>Your lowest 3 assignments can be replaced by your final exam grade, provided that the final exam grade is higher. If an assignment grade is changed due to academic integrity issues, then such a grade CANNOT be replaced by the final exam.</p><p>If you have documented illness or declared short-term absence, the standard accommodation is a 48-hour extension. This is not automatic, you need to contact the instructor through email or Piazza first. If you receive such an extension, then the late penalty for submitting after the end of the extension is 100%. It is not possible to extend beyond 48 hours. A missed assignment may be covered by the grade replacement scheme above.</p><p>You are expected to do the assignments on your own. In particular, you must write up your own solutions, and you cannot share your solutions with anyone. You may also seek help on the course Piazza and with the course instructor and TAs. You are not allowed to use other sources of help for the assignments, including (but not limited to) seeking direct help from online or in person sources, using materials from previous offerings of the course, and using discussion boards/apps (except the course Piazza) such as Discord/Whatsapp/Messenger.</p><p>Teaching staff for the course actively look for evidence of academic offences when evaluating assignment submissions. By university policy, academic integrity violations by a student in assignments will result in a mark of zero in that assignment and potentially will lead to a 5% deduction from the Final Course Grade. In addition, all academic offences are reported to the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies and are recorded in the student’s file (this may lead to further, more severe consequences).</p><p>A missed assignment will be treated the same as a mark of zero.</p><h4>Midterm</h4><p>There is a midterm exam. It takes place during the lecture on February 26. It is a closed book exam, no aids are allowed. Information about the coverage of the midterm will be announced on LEARN. Your midterm grade can be replaced by your final exam grade, provided that the final exam grade is higher.</p><p>A missed midterm will be treated the same as a mark of zero.</p><h4>Final Exam</h4><p>The final exam will be comprehensive, and is scheduled by the Office of the Registrar later in the term. It is a closed book exam, no aids are allowed. </p>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  No assignment screening will be used in this course.

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4><strong>PIAZZA</strong></h4><p>We will be using Piazza to facilitate discussions during this course. The course staff will visit Piazza on a regular basis and will try to answer questions in a timely manner. Some general guidelines on Piazza posting:</p><ul><li>The aim is to create a positive learning environment for everyone. Please be professional and courteous. (Though an occasional meme post might be ok.)</li><li>For assignment problems, you can ask for clarifications, but do not post any full or partial solutions, nor any strong hints. If you have a specific question that include partial solutions to assignment problems, please use private posts. Note that we cannot verify if your solution is correct or not on piazza.</li><li>Please put some thoughts into your questions and posts. You should show that you have worked on the problem in some way. A post similar to “I’m stuck, any hints?” is not appropriate and will not receive help.</li><li>You are encouraged to help each other and answer questions. For student answers that are correct and do not require additional clarification, the course staff will endorse them without making a further response.</li><li>Often times the course staff do not give you a direct response to your question. Instead, we may ask a probing question that helps you discover or verify the answer on your own.</li></ul><h4><strong>RE-MARKING POLICIES</strong></h4><p>If you believe that there are marking errors in your assignments or the midterm and you would like to make a re-marking request, then you need to create a private Piazza post that includes your student ID and which assignment or midterm problem that you want re-marked, with an explanation. You are expected to have read and understood the official solutions before you post. You need to do this within one week of the date the assessment is marked and returned to you.</p><p>Note that your solution will be very carefully examined during a re-mark. So it is possible that your grade is reduced. Also, we cannot mark anything that is not in your submission. For example, if your solution has some missing details and you try to provide them in your request, we will not consider that. Moreover, complaints about the marking scheme itself is not a valid reason for adjusting marks. For example, say you think that one type of mistake leads to too many marks being taken off. As long as this is consistently applied to all students, then it is not a marking error.</p><h4><strong>INC POLICY</strong></h4><p>In case of serious illness during the final exam, you may be granted a grade of INC provided that</p><ul><li>you have suitable medical documentation that you submit to the Math Undergraduate Office; and</li><li>you have passing grades for at least 5 assignments and the midterm.</li></ul><p>Granting a grade of INC is at the discretion of your instructor. </p><h4><strong>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</strong></h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as formulating problems as optimization programs and solving linear programs. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>
