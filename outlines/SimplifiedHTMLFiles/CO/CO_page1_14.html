Please sign yourself up at<br/>https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/co370<br/>We will use Piazza to discuss course material, assignments, and organizational issues. This will be your main point of contact with instructors and teaching assistants. Please be respectful and polite. As you will receive credit for each assignment do not give away answers. You can help fellow students by clearing ambiguity, or pointing to the appropriate material in the course, however. If you are unsure if your post on Piazza gives away too much of an assignment’s answer, please post it as a private post, i.e. visible to the instructor and the TAs only. We may then choose to make the post public if it is appropriate. You can freely discuss the material in the lectures and the course notes.<br/><u>Only use your UWaterloo email account to sign up on Piazza. We want to limit access to Piazza to students enrolled in the course and may unenroll you if it is a private email.</u></p>

In the unlikely event you do not receive your assignment, contact D2L help. Note, we will post assignments on D2L as well so in all cases you will be able to get started immediately. </p><p>Collaboration (with other students enrolled in CO370 this term) in groups of size at most 3 is allowed on assignments 2,3,4 and 5. Collaboration is limited to discussing the problem. You must write up your own solutions without seeking help from anyone and list the names of your collaborators. </p><p>The assignment is due at 11:59pm EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) on the due day. This is a hard deadline. Late assignments will receive no credit regardless of the reason why. </p><p>In particular, technical issues, such as being unable to load assignments are not considered a valid excuse. You will have 13 days to complete the assignment and there will be ample time to work out any logistical issues. Under no circumstances will extensions be granted. In extenuating circumstances if you're unable to submit a homework, upto one missed homework will be shifted to the term tests. </p><p> </p><p>Crowdmark lets you upload assignments as many times as you wish. Thus we suggest the following strategy,</p><p>• Upload the assignment after you complete each question.</p><p>• Do not try to submit your assignment close to the deadline.</p><p>In exceptional circumstances you can email us the assignment and if we receive it before the deadline we will credit the work. One reason for the hard deadline is that we wish to post solutions to assignments as soon as possible, i.e. right after the submission deadline. Another reason is for work to be graded on time. </p><p><strong>Remarking requests</strong><br/>Once you receive your marked assignment, you will have one week to request any remarking. We will not revise the marking after that. To get your assignment remarked proceed as follows for each question,<br/>1. Find the email of the TA that marked the question,<br/>2. Write a concise message explaining why you think you received an erroneous mark,<br/>3. Wait for 48 hours, if you do not hear from the TA by then, send a follow up message.<br/>For (1) the information will be available on D2L where assignments are posted. </p><h4><strong>Term tests</strong></h4><p>There are 2 term tests in this course. They take place during lectures (see schedule above). You are allowed to bring one letter-size information sheet of paper, with handwritten notes prepared by yourself, which will be collected at the end of the test. No other aids are allowed. Information about the coverage of each test will be announced on LEARN. </p><p>A missed test will be treated the same as a mark of zero. </p><p> </p><p> </p>

  University Policy

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
