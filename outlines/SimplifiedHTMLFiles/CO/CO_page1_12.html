<p>A <strong>discrete optimization problem</strong>, broadly speaking, involves a discrete set of feasible solutions and a real-valued objective function that assigns a value to each solution. The goal is to find a solution that minimizes  (or maximizes) the objective value. Enumerating all feasible solutions is typically impractical or results in algorithms with prohibitively large running times. This class of problems includes many NP-hard problems, which, unless P=NP, do not have efficient solution methods.</p><p>Discrete optimization problems are of immense practical importance, are solved every day (sometimes each hour or more frequently) by many Fortune 500 companies;  well-known problems in the class include</p><ul><li><strong>The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP):</strong> Given n cities and pairwise distances between (some of) these cities, the goal is to find the shortest tour that visits all cities.</li><li><strong>The Set Cover Problem:</strong> Given a universe U of elements and subsets S<sub>1</sub>,…,S<sub>m</sub>​ of U, the objective is to find the smallest number of these subsets that collectively cover all of U.</li></ul><p>This course provides an introduction to the broad field of discrete optimization and covers several classes of commonly used techniques for the design of algorithms, including:</p><ul><li>Greedy algorithms,</li><li>Dynamic programming,</li><li>Local search, and</li><li>Solution approaches using mathematical programming.</li></ul><p>We will discuss algorithmic efficiency and introduce the basics of complexity theory. For NP-hard problems, we will explore the field of approximation algorithms, which provides efficient methods for computing solutions with guaranteed quality. </p><p>Students will complete two practical projects as part of the course, where they will develop, implement, and test algorithms for specific discrete optimization problems.</p><p>The class will rely on formal proofs to argue about properties of the presented algorithms. Students will be asked, on occasion, to produce proofs to argue in their assignment work. Handling proofs at the level of CO250 suffices to pass this course. </p>

<p><strong>Assignments</strong>. Assignments are to be done individually. Students are allowed to discuss the assignments with classmates, but all submitted solutions should be obtained and written by the submitting student. For example, copying or paraphrasing of solutions for previous course offerings or online resources are to be treated as a violation of academic integrity. Each collaboration and resource used to prepare the submission should be appropriately acknowledged in the submission. ("I discussed the possible approaches for Q1 with Alice Sand.", "The idea for Q1 was taken from Chapter 8 in the book "Approximation Algorithms" by Vijay Vazirani.") A presence of such an acknowledgement is not going to have a negative impact on the grade, but an absence of an acknowledgement or its parts can be considered as a violation of academic integrity.</p><p><strong>Projects</strong>. Projects are to be done in groups of two-three. Projects are to be implemented using C++ or Python or Java, it is your responsibility to make sure that you have a sufficient proficiency in C++ or Python or Java to succeed in the course. This is the responsibility of students to follow the format specified in the project description. Submissions not following the specified format might be assessed based only on their performance and correctness of their output without providing feedback. For the projects, the same policies hold as for assignments. The collaboration within the submitting group do not need to be mentioned, while all other collaborations and used resources need to be acknowledged. </p><p><strong>Midterm exam</strong>. The exam takes place during the regular class time slot.</p><p><strong>INC</strong>. To be considered for INC a student has to pass at least one Midterm exam, i.e. obtain at least 50 % for one of the Midterm exams. Additionally, to be considered for INC a student has to obtain at least 70 % of the projects and assignments, i.e. obtain at least 21 % of the final grade through projects and assignments. </p><p>In case you are not able to participate in some of the assessments please visit this <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/vif-submission">webpage</a> to submit the required information. After the instructor is notified about the successful submission, the weight of the missed assessment should be reallocated to the Final exam.</p><p>To pass the course one needs to get at least 50% on two of the three in-person assessments, i.e. one final exam and two midterm exams. </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
