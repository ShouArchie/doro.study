<p><strong>Assessments:</strong></p><p>All assignments and exams are intended to assess <strong><u>your individual knowledge/understanding of course content</u></strong>. Collaboration with other students is not allowed under any circumstances. For definitions of unauthorized collaboration, please consult the relevant tutorials provided by the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/academic-misconduct">Office of Academic Integrity</a>. Cases of unauthorized collaboration will be dealt with according to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 – Student Discipline</a> (see <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/sites/ca.secretariat/files/uploads/files/final_framework_for_assessment_of_undergrad_unauthorized_collaboration_oct_8_2019_002_0.pdf">Framework for the Assessment of Unauthorized Collaboration Involving Undergraduate Students</a>.</p><p><i><u>Assignments</u></i></p><p>The assignments and R programming are intended to supplement the lecture material by providing students with the opportunity to apply course concepts in a critical manner.</p><p>To provide all students with an equal footing, students will be provided with supplemental video tutorials covering R's basics and the relevant functions required for each assignment (through the course site on LEARN). <strong>Students are expected to review the supplemental materials to complete the assignments.</strong></p><p>All assignments will be posted using the Dropbox on the LEARN course site. Students will submit all assignments via the Dropbox using the .R file template included in the assignment Dropbox. Assignments are to be submitted by 4 pm on the date indicated. <strong><u>Late assignments will be penalized 20% per day starting at 4:01 pm on the day the assignment is due</u></strong>. </p><p><i><u>Final Exam</u></i></p><p>The final exam will consist of two parts. Part 1 will assess your understanding of fundamental statistical concepts. Part 2 will assess your ability your critical thought ability and the ability to interpret results to answer research questions.</p><p>Part 1 of the final exam will occur on Tuesday, April 1<sup>st</sup>. Part 2 of the final exam will take place on Thursday, April 3<sup>rd</sup>.  Both parts of the exam will be closed book. </p><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy

<div>
<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods is a useful tool for troubleshooting R programming code. </p><p>GenAI may be used for assignments in this class. However, students must use GenAI in the context of the assignment (e.g. use any specific R programming packages required in the assignment). <strong>Students are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work they submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </strong></p><p>Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may, therefore, contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
