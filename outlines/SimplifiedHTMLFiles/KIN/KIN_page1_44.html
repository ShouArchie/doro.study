<p>Welcome to KIN 404: Physiological Basis of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes! My name is Dr. Russ Tupling and I’m looking forward to learning together. KIN 404 is a lecture- and readings-based course that encourages the application of knowledge acquired in your 100-200 level courses and provides an opportunity to further develop knowledge related to human physiology, metabolism, exercise and nutrition. KIN 404 is a required course for the Medical Physiology Minor and a restricted elective course for the Human Nutrition Minor. </p><p>Our learning will take place on the traditional territory of‎ the Attawandaron, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, land granted by the Haldimand Treaty of 1784 to the Haudenosaunee of the Six Nations of the Grand River. The University of Waterloo territorial acknowledgement recognizes the various Anishinaabeg groups (tribes) that utilized the region and have treaties involving broad geographical area the University of Waterloo is located within, namely the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation and associated treaties, Dish with One Spoon wampum belt agreement of 1701, and the Huron Tract Treaty of 1827.<i> </i>As part of the UW community, I encourage you to engage with the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/engagement-knowledge-building/resources-allyship">resources and allyship information</a> provided by the Office of Indigenous Relations, as a starting point.</p><p><strong>While I recognize our course syllabus is long, it is very important as it outlines our class norms and expectations—please read it thoroughly!</strong></p>

<p><strong>COURSE EVALUATION</strong></p><p><strong>Term Tests – Four term tests</strong> worth <strong>24%</strong> each on lecture content and assigned readings.</p><p>Term Tests are closed book, no aids are allowed. More detail will be provided in class and on Learn.</p><p><strong>i&gt;Clicker quizzes – 1% per section</strong> during Group Competition lectures (see below)</p><p>i&gt;Clicker quizzes during the Group Competition lectures are closed book, no aids are allowed. However, you may work with other members in your group to discuss the questions and seek out the correct answers.  </p><p><strong>Bonus marks</strong>: It is possible to earn one bonus mark per section up to a maximum of 4% (i.e. it is possible to achieve 104% in this course) by performing moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA, 3-6 METs) at least 150 min/week (<a href=" https://csepguidelines.ca/guidelines/adults-18-64/">CSEP guidelines</a>), which must be tracked using a wearable device (e.g. fitbit, apple watch, garmin) and/or physical activity app (<a href="https://www.strava.com/sports/running?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_term=strava&amp;utm_content=Brand_Universal&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMInuTS8fXfigMVcJWDBx0LvTwsEAAYASAAEgKkJPD_BwE">Strava</a> is highly recommended), and shared with the TA or instructor's PhD student (Maryam Khan <a href="mm9khan@uwaterloo.ca">mm9khan@uwaterloo.ca</a>). Physical activity intensity will be determined using the <a href="https://pacompendium.com/adult-compendium/">Adult Compendium of Physical Activities</a>. Each section is 3 weeks so students must perform 150 min of MVPA for all 3 weeks of a section to earn 1 bonus mark for that section. The schedule is:</p><p>Section One (Regulation of Energy Intake): Week One - Jan. 6-12; Week Two - Jan. 13-19; Week Three - Jan. 20-26</p><p>Section Two (Regulation of Energy Expenditure): Week One - Jan. 27 - Feb. 2; Week Two - Feb. 3-9; Week Three - Feb. 10-16</p><p>Section Three (Regulation of Energy Storage): Week One - Feb. 24 - Mar. 2; Week Two - Mar. 3-9; Week Three - Mar. 10-16</p><p>Section Four (Physical Activity and Diet Interventions): Week One - Mar. 17-23; Week Two - Mar. 24-30; Week Three - Mar. 31 - Apr. 6</p><p>The purpose of this bonus assignment is to encourage students to prioritize their health and wellness this term, in part through engaging in daily physical activities, such as brisk walking, biking, aerobic gym workouts, or sports, while learning to track their activity through the Strava app or other similar tools. </p><p> </p><p><strong>GROUP COMPETITION BASED ON ASSIGNED READINGS                        </strong></p><p>There are 2 research articles and 1 review article that will be assigned reading for each section. It is recommended that students read the review article prior to the first lecture for that section. Students should read all the articles prior to the Group Competition class for each section.  I have divided the class into 8 groups as follows: <strong>Group 1A</strong>, BIOMEDSCI students (1<sup>st</sup> half of alphabet); <strong>Group 1B</strong>, BIOMEDSCI students (2<sup>nd</sup> half of alphabet); <strong>Group 2A</strong>, BIOL students; <strong>Group 2B</strong>, SCI students; <strong>Group 3A</strong>, HLTH students; <strong>Group 3B</strong>, CS, ERS, LIBST, PSYS, PD, and Exchange students; <strong>Group 4A</strong>, KIN Regular students; and <strong>Group 4B</strong>, KIN Co-op students. The groups are posted on D2L/Learn so you can verify which group you belong to. All Group One members (1A and 1B) will be responsible for generating 3 multiple choice questions (<strong>see how to format your questions below</strong>) based on the assigned readings and lectures (i.e. 1 question for each research article and 1 question based either on the review article or the lectures) for Section One which they will post on D2L/Learn at least 24 hours prior to the Group Competition Class <strong>(worth 1%)</strong> and the other groups (all members) will attempt to answer selected questions during the Group Competition Class using i&gt;clickers <strong>(worth 1% for a passing grade, i.e. &gt;50% correct)</strong>. All Group Two members (2A and 2B) will generate MC questions based on the assigned readings and lectures for Section Two and so on, which means each group will be tested for 3 out of the 4 sections and the group with the highest total (%) of correct answers at the end of the term will win a pizza party with me. <strong>It is possible that some of the student-generated questions could be used on the Term Test.</strong> This format is intended to generate discussion and review content related to the assigned readings and the lectures and hopefully to help prepare students for the Term Tests. The assigned readings have been selected to present current research from some of the best obesity and diabetes researchers in the world. Some of the readings cover topics that are not covered in detail in lectures.</p><p><strong>Multiple Choice Question Format: <u>All submitted MC questions must have 5 answer options (A-E) to receive the full (1%) mark;</u> (bold </strong>or highlight the correct answer<strong>)</strong></p><p>1.

<p><strong>COURSE COMMUNICATION PLAN</strong> </p><p><i><strong>Student (Office) Hours</strong></i>: It’s important to know that Student Office Hours are dedicated time for you! You are welcome to drop in with any questions you have, whether that be course related or more broadly about university life. I don’t have scheduled office hours but feel free to drop in anytime or please send me an email to book a meeting. </p><p><i><strong>Email:</strong></i> Feel free to email me if you have any questions throughout the course. I am here to help! I will do my best to respond within 48 hours during normal working hours (i.e., 8:30 AM – 4:30 PM Monday to Friday). However, please remember I am human! Sometimes I might be a little late or the email may get lost. If you don’t hear back within 4 working days, feel free to re-send your email with a friendly reminder. While I will do my best to answer your questions in a timely manner, please note that you should not expect to receive answers to emails on weekends, including the weekends before assignment due dates. </p><p><strong>ADDITIONAL POLICY INFO</strong> </p><p>In this section and the section below, there are important policies and information that you should familiarize yourself with before starting this course. I would really appreciate it if you could take the time to go through this section, to learn about some expected norms of our learning environment. </p><p><strong>STUDENT ABSENCES – ACADEMIC CONSIDERATIONS AND ACCOMMODATIONS</strong></p><p>Students have the following options for declaring an absence during the Winter 2025 term:</p><p><strong>Absences in Quest</strong></p><p><u>Religious or creed-related absence</u></p><p>Undergraduate students can now submit a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#religious">Religious Observance Self-Declaration</a> in Quest. This allows students to register the dates of potential conflict with coursework. As the dates of important religious observances are generally known well in advance, students must consult with their instructors within two weeks of the announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. </p><p><u>Short-term absence</u><strong> </strong>(once/term) – Undergraduate students only</p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#short-term-absence">self-declare</a> one<strong> </strong>short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason (no documentation required). A short-term absence covers up to two calendar days during the <i>formal lecture period</i>. Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), and Studio (STU) courses/class components do not qualify for accommodation as a result of a self-declared short-term absence. There is no expectation that a self-declared short-term absence be total; that is, students may elect to participate in any course and complete any course element(s) despite not being required to. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><p><u>COVID-19-related absence</u><strong> </strong>(once/term) </p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#covid-19">self-declare</a> an absence of up to 10 days due to COVID-19-related illness. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in online components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Absences Requiring Documentation - </strong><a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/admin#/"><strong>Absence Database</strong></a><strong> – </strong>Undergraduate students only</p><p><u>Absence due to illness  </u></p><p>When students are unable to meet academic obligations due to illness, they are required to complete the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances web form</a> (log in required) and upload their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/students/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/verification-of-illness-form-website-fillable-final_0.pdf">Verification of Illness Form</a> (VIF) to the site. The University of Waterloo Verification of Illness Form (VIF) is normally the only medical documentation accepted to support requests for academic consideration. Students should not submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to their instructors, teaching assistants, or advisors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able given their health condition. Once approved, the student and their instructors will receive a confirmation email of the student’s absence. Course instructors will determine how missed course components are accommodated. </p><p><u>Absence due to extenuating circumstances</u></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (bereavement, family illness, varsity sports, etc.), students are required to complete the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances web form</a> (log in required) and upload their official documentation (e.g., plane tickets, court documents, police reports, etc.) to the site. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact instructors within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able given their circumstances. </p><p><strong>Important note:</strong> Travel that results in arrival to campus after the first day of class, absence before or after a reading break or departure from campus during the final exam period DO NOT warrant accommodation and any missed academic obligations will receive a grade of zero. </p><p><strong>A colleague's reflection I share:</strong> We will do our best to navigate challenges that arise this semester together. If you need to submit any absence form, please email me within 24-48 hours of a deadline. It is important that any students requiring academic accommodations based on religion, Indigenous, and spiritual observances know that these requests will be respected in our class. While the University of Waterloo uses the standard Canadian holiday schedule for class planning, in this class we will create a space where religious celebrations of all our students do not impede on their academic success. If you are celebrating any of the holidays listed here (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/days-observance">Religious and Spiritual Days of Observance | Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Anti-racism (uwaterloo.ca)</a>) (or others that may be missed), please feel free to reach out to me about accommodations. </p><p>In cases where you anticipate missed work in advance, please email me as soon as possible to facilitate arrangements. <strong>The overall golden rule: please communicate with me as early as you can! </strong></p><p><strong>CO-OP INTERVIEWS</strong> </p><p>Academic obligations take priority over co-op interviews. Whenever possible students are encouraged to swap interview times to avoid conflicts with academic obligations. For details and procedures on what to do if you have an interview conflict, please see the Interview Conflict (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-opjob/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts">https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-opjob/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts</a>) page on UW’s website. </p><p>If you are not able to resolve your interview conflict with a lab or tutorial, you may request to swap lab/tutorial sections for only the day/week in question. Please provide your instructor a screenshot from WaterlooWorks such that your name and the date and time of the scheduled interview are visible. If the interview was scheduled outside of WaterlooWorks, a letter/email from the prospective employer with the details outlined above will suffice. </p><p>If you're feeling overwhelmed with your interview schedule, you can contact your co-op advisor to discuss available options and/or fill out a Request for Interview Relief Form (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-yourco-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview#request-interview-relief">https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-yourco-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview#request-interview-relief</a>) on WaterlooWorks. Depending on your situation, you may be able to choose to be removed from one or more of your upcoming interviews by having your job application(s) withdrawn. </p><p><strong>STUDENT SUPPORT</strong> </p><p>You are a valued part of our community. We recognize that our individual identities shape our experiences in higher education. Some of us disproportionately encounter systemic barriers to belonging. University life can be difficult with multiple demands. The Faculty of Health is committed and actively working to foster an environment where you belong and can thrive. You may experience stressors that can impact your personal well-being and academic experience, but there are multiple supports and resources available to you on and off-campus.
