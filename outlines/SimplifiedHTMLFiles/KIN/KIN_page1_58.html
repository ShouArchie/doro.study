<p>Welcome to KIN 471b: Physical Activity Behaviour Change! My name is Dr. Sheereen Harris and I’m looking forward to learning together and exploring the theories and principles of exercise psychology and behaviour change. </p><p>Our learning will take place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishnaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. As part of the UW community, I encourage you to engage with the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/knowledge-building/resources-allyship">resources and allyship</a> information provided by the Office of Indigenous Relations, as a starting point.</p><p><strong>While I recognize our course syllabus is long, it is very important as it outlines our class norms and expectations—please read it thoroughly!</strong></p>

You will then complete a reflection comparing the two assessment tools including their advantages and disadvantages as well as reliability and validity in the context of behaviour change.</p><h4><strong>Behaviour Change Technique Presentation (20%)</strong></h4><p>In pairs, students will prepare and deliver a presentation critically reviewing commercially available smartphone applications commonly used to monitor and change physical activity behaviour. Groups will identify the behaviour change techniques used in the apps, rank the apps from best to worst, and provide evidence-based suggestions.</p><h4><strong>Target Population Intervention Project (25%) </strong></h4><p>Students will develop skills required to create a print media intervention promoting physical activity in a target population. You will create a 1-page (single sided) colour brochure using a combination of text and images using specific behaviour change techniques and messaging techniques. You will also complete a written justification highlighting the content of your brochure and explaining your rationale guiding your decisions.</p><h4><strong>Individual Counselling Intervention Project (30%)</strong></h4><p>The assignment will consist of the following components: </p><p><u>1. Case Report (20%)</u></p><p>You will complete a written case report including a literature review and background information, procedures and measures used throughout the intervention, a summary of key results, and a brief discussion and reflection of the intervention.</p><p><u>2. Case notes (5%)</u></p><p>You will maintain a set of case/session notes chronicling your reflections on each of your counselling sessions. Each reflection should include the objectives outlined in the lesson plan and any modifications, a description of what your client has done since your last meeting, the content of your discussions during the session, and your thoughts on future modifications for future sessions with your client.</p><p><u>3. Presentation (5%)</u></p><p>You will prepare and deliver a presentation summarizing key components from your intervention including a description of your client, baseline information related to your client, intervention objectives, post-intervention results, and a brief discussion on successes and challenges of the intervention.</p><h4><strong>Self-Evaluation (10%)</strong></h4><p>Your Self-Evaluation Grade will consist of regular class attendance, participation in lecture discussions and activities, asking questions, and contributing to the learning of your peers and instructor during lecture. You will complete and submit the Self-Evaluation Form at the end of term. </p><p><i>Please Note: The Course Instructor will have final say and ability to modify your Self-Evaluation mark if your Self-Evaluation mark does not match your justification and is grotesquely inflated. So, please be honest – the purpose of including a Self-Evaluation mark is to encourage some dialogue and participation during lecture, as well as provide an opportunity to have a little control over one aspect of your final grade. If the self-evaluation is not submitted during this time, a student will receive a zero for this portion of the final grade.</i></p><h4><strong>Other Assessment Guidelines:</strong></h4><p><i><strong>Authentic work:</strong> </i>All graded assignments in KIN 453 are expected to be authentically created work by the individual (Measurement Assignment, Target Population Intervention Project, Individual Counselling Project) or group (Behaviour Change Technique Presentation). Therefore, no sharing, collaborating, copying, or using other classmates’ work (or previous cohorts’ assignments) on your assignments will be tolerated. </p><p><i><strong>Submitting Files: </strong></i>For written work, please submit assignments as Microsoft Word or PDF documents. For presentations, please submit PowerPoint files. If you plan to use another technology, it is your responsibility to connect with me in advance to ensure I can open the file type on my computer. Your last submission to the LEARN Dropbox prior to the deadline will be graded. APA 7 will be used; proper referencing is expected for all graded submissions.</p><p><i><strong>Late Penalty: </strong></i>On all assessments, a penalty of 5% per day will be applied to all late submissions without documentation or <i>prior </i>discussions with the instructor. If you have a concern about a deadline, please reach out to discuss. </p><p><i><strong>Reviewing Feedback: </strong></i>I am happy to go over your graded work and provide clarification when needed. However, students must wait 24 hours after feedback has been returned before contacting me; during this time, students are encouraged to review and reflect on the feedback received. After 24 hours, students have up to 1 week (7 days) to contact me to ask for further feedback or clarification.</p>
</div>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>KIN 471 is an in-person seminar style class that will not regularly be recorded. However, in the event of unforeseen circumstances, activities for this course may involve recording, in partial fulfillment of the course learning outcomes.  </p><p>You will receive notification of recording via at least one of the following mechanisms: within the Learning Management System (LEARN), a message from your course instructor, course syllabus/website, or other means. Some technologies may also provide a recording indicator. Images, audio, text/chat messaging that have been recorded may be used and/or made available by the University to Sheereen Harris for purposes including material review and assessment. Recordings will be managed according to the University records classification scheme, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/records-management/records-classification-and-retention-schedules"><u>WatClass</u></a>, and will be securely destroyed when no longer needed by the University. Your personal information is protected in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31"><u>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</u></a>, as well as <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/privacy/"><u>University policies and guidelines</u></a> and may be subject to disclosure where required by law.</p><p>The University will use reasonable means to protect the security and confidentiality of the recorded information, but cannot provide a guarantee of such due to factors beyond the University’s control, such as recordings being forwarded, copied, intercepted, circulated, disclosed, or stored without the University’s knowledge or permission or the introduction of malware into computer system which could potentially damage or disrupt the computer, networks, and security settings. The University is not responsible for connectivity/technical difficulties or loss of data associated with your hardware, software or Internet connection.</p><p>By engaging in course activities that involve recording, you are consenting to the use of your appearance, image, text/chat messaging, and voice and/or likeness in the manner and under the conditions specified herein.

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>In this section and the section below, there are important policies and information that you should familiarize yourself with before starting this course. I would really appreciate it if you could take the time to go through this section, to learn about some expected norms of our learning environment. </p><h4><strong>Course Communication Plan</strong></h4><p><i><strong>Student (Office) Hours: </strong></i>It’s important to know that Student Office Hours are dedicated time for you! You are welcome to drop in with any questions you have, whether that be course related or more broadly about university life. I have scheduled our time for Thursdays @ 3-4pm, right before our class in my office (BMH 1054). My student hours will be held weekly. If you need to connect outside of this time or want to discuss a more sensitive matter, please send me an email and we will make alternative arrangements together. </p><p><i><strong>Email: </strong></i>Feel free to email me if you have any questions throughout the course. I am here to help! I will do my best to respond within 48 hours during normal working hours (i.e., 8:30 AM – 4:30 PM Monday to Friday). However, please remember I am human! Sometimes I might be a little late or the email may get lost. If you don’t hear back within 4 working days, feel free to re-send your email with a friendly reminder. While I will do my best to answer your questions in a timely manner, please note that you should not expect to receive answers to emails on weekends, including the weekends before assignment due dates.</p><h4><strong>Generative AI</strong></h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as communicating effectively (written and verbal) via original material. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including outlines, research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></h4><p>Be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of the instructor, teaching assistant, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spokenand written (and any audio/video recording thereof).</li><li>Lecture handouts,presentations, and othermaterials prepared for the course(e.g., PowerPoint slides).</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g.,assignments, quizzes, tests,final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g.,any work authoredby the instructor or teaching assistant or used by the instructor or teaching assistant with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason,it is necessary to ask the instructor, teaching assistant and/orthe University of Waterloo for permission beforeuploading and sharingthe intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, teaching assistant or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar coursesin subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights and academic integrity. </p><h4><strong>Wellness in KIN 471</strong></h4><p>You are a valued part of our community. We recognize that our individual identities shape our experiences in higher education. Some of us disproportionately encounter systemic barriers to belonging. University life can be difficult with multiple demands. The Faculty of Health is committed and actively working to foster an environment where you belong and can thrive. You may experience stressors that can impact your personal well-being and academic experience, but there are multiple supports and resources available to you on and off-campus.

Students complete the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances web form</a> (log in required) and upload their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness Form</a> (VIF) and/or other supporting documentation to the site. The webform includes a list of courses the student is currently enrolled in, and the student is required to indicate any missed elements. Students should not be submitting their Verification of Illness Form (or other documentation) to instructors or advisors. The UG Associate Dean’s Office will review each submission, including documentation, and determine whether to approve the absence request. Once approved, students and instructors will receive a confirmation email of the absence. Advisors will be notified if there are questions or concerns about a student’s well-being, such as submitting multiple VIFs in one academic term or documentation for a lengthy absence.</li><li><strong>Extenuating Circumstances </strong>– unable to meet academic obligations due to extenuating circumstances (bereavement, family illness, varsity sports, etc.). Students are required to complete the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances web form</a> (log in required) and upload their official documentation (e.g., plane tickets, court documents, police reports, etc.) to the site. </li></ol><p><i><strong>For all types of absence, students should submit documentation no later than 48 hours following the due date of the missed assessment. </strong></i></p><p>In addition to illness, there may be events that preclude students from meeting academic obligations. You can read more about <a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">academic regulations and accommodations here</a>. The following are examples of valid circumstances and required documentation that <strong>may </strong>warrant academic accommodation:</p><ul><li>A member of a varsity team travelling for competition: a letter/email from the Head Coach verifying the departure and return dates and times.</li><li>Death of a family member: a copy of the death certificate, a copy of the obituary or a link to the online obituary.</li><li>Travel: from time-to-time students are required to travel during an academic term for reasons NOT related to pleasure/vacation. If you are travelling and require accommodation, you must inform the instructor at least 2 weeks in advance of your travel, indicate the reason for travel and provide a boarding pass upon return to campus.</li></ul><p><strong>Important note:</strong> Travel that results in arrival to campus after the first day of class, absence before or after a reading break or departure from campus during the final exam period DO NOT warrant accommodation and any missed academic obligations will receive a grade of zero.</p><p><i><strong>A colleague's reflection I share</strong></i>: We will do our best to navigate challenges that arise this semester together. If you need to submit any absence form, please email me within 24-48 hours of a deadline. It is important that any students requiring academic accommodations based on religion, Indigenous, and spiritual observances know that these requests will be respected in our class. While the University of Waterloo uses the standard Canadian holiday schedule for class planning, in this class we will create a space where religious celebrations of all our students do not impede on their academic success. If you are celebrating any of the holidays <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/resources/religious-and-spiritual-days-observance-2025">listed here </a>(or others that may be missed), please feel free to reach out to me about accommodations.</p><p>In cases where you anticipate missed work in advance, please email me as soon as possible to facilitate arrangements. The overall golden rule: please communicate with me as early as you can!</p><h4><strong>Note for students with disabilities or those seeking accommodations for racial trauma </strong></h4><p><i><strong>A colleague's reflection I share: </strong></i>In the University Policy section below you will find reference to AccessAbilities Services. Alongside connecting with AccessAbility Services, I am always open to suggestions or conversations around how to make our learning space more accessible and would welcome a meeting or email. It is important to also note that AccessAbility services isn't just for folks with disabilities. For example, in addition to providing academic accommodations for students with disabilities, AccessAbility Services also offers accommodations for students experiencing the physical, emotional, and psychological effects of racism and racial trauma.

  University Policy

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
