  Course Description

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>KIN 470:</div>
<p>An examination of current major issues and trends in Kinesiology. Students select areas of major interest from a series of faculty introduced topics.</p>

<div>
<p>Welcome to KIN 470!</p><p>This section of the Kinesiology seminars is focused on concepts surrounding development, design, testing, application, and assessment of tools used to improve human activity. KIN 470 is a seminar course that encourages the application of knowledge and skills acquired in your 100-300 level courses and provides an opportunity to further develop skills related to knowledge acquisition and communication. In this section we will develop skills including literature searching, appraisal and interpretation, oral presentation and writing skills, and peer evaluation while focusing on topics surrounding concepts of assistive design. </p><p>What kind of considerations would you need to make a better joint replacement? What about an exoskeleton to help people at work? Perhaps a better hockey helmet? How would you see if these things are better or worse than current design? What kind of materials should you consider? Our goal will be to examine how we implement things to better our life through the use of the virtuous circle - if we can <i>see </i>something, then we can <i>measure </i>it, and ultimately <i>implement</i> a solution before starting the cycle again.</p><p>Our learning will take place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishnaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. As part of the UW community, I encourage you to engage with the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/knowledge-building/resources-allyship">resources and allyship</a> information provided by the Office of Indigenous Relations as a starting point.</p>

<p>All assessments will be submitted to LEARN. Presentation dates for each student will vary. However, all presentation files are due on the same day to help promote equity between students in the class, who may be presenting weeks apart. Below are the due dates, which are also included in the course schedule:</p><ul><li>Short Presentation Files: Friday January 17th @ 11:55pm</li><li>Long Presentation Files: Monday February 26th @ noon</li><li>1 Page Proposal (OPTIONAL): Friday March 22nd @ 11:59pm</li><li>Scientific Report: Friday April 12th 11:59pm</li></ul><h4><strong>SHORT (NON-SPECIALIST AUDIENCE) PRESENTATION (15%)</strong></h4><p>Each student will choose a topic related to physical activity behaviour change to explain to a general audience (i.e., non-specialists, someone without a scientific background); each presentation must be on a different topic area that will be chosen by the <strong>end of class on January 10<sup>th</sup></strong>. The presenter will prepare a <strong>5-minute presentation</strong> on their topic using appropriate supporting materials such as PowerPoint (1-5 slides recommended) so that anyone can understand the topic.</p><p><strong>All presentation files are due on the same day: Friday, January 17<sup>th</sup> @ 11:55 PM</strong>. Regardless of your presentation date, your presentation files (e.g., PowerPoint slides) must be completed and submitted by this deadline. Files will be uploaded to the LEARN Dropbox. This is to ensure equity between students in the class who may be presenting many weeks apart. </p><p>There will be a 5-minute interactive open feedback and discussion period following each presentation where fellow students will ask questions, provide positive and constructive comments, and share ideas for consideration on the presentation.</p><p>Four students will be selected to provide feedback for each presenter. You will not be required to submit evaluations on the dates of your own presentations. Remember that your comments on the evaluation form are very useful for the professional development of the presenter. You will be expected to include a remark outlining something done well and something that could be further developed. The peer evaluation will be submitted electronically (using Microsoft Forms) no later than 11:59pm on the evening of the presentation. Feedback can be completed using a laptop during the presentation. Alternatively, feedback forms can be completed on paper, but the student must upload their responses to Forms by the deadline that same evening. Positive and constructive comments will be evaluated by the instructor and must accurately reflect the quality of the presentation. The peer evaluations (worth 5%) will be combined with the instructor’s comments (10%) and will be provided anonymously to the presenter.</p><h4><strong>LONG (SCIENTIFIC) PRESENTATION (35%)</strong></h4><p>Each student will develop and prepare <strong>a 15-minute presentation </strong>on their selected topic using appropriate support materials, such as PowerPoint. The topic of the presentation should be the same as the Short Presentation. If the student wishes to make an adjustment to their topic, they must discuss the change with the course instructor. The presentation should be based on scientific evidence especially from primary peer reviewed research articles. Other website materials, anecdotal articles, lecture notes and opinions are allowed, but should be used provide context for the scientific literature.</p><p><strong>Like with the short presentation, all presentation files are due on the same day: Monday, February 24th @ 10am. </strong>Regardless of your presentation date, your presentation files must be completed and submitted by this deadline to ensure equity between students in the class who may be presenting many weeks apart. Files will be uploaded to the LEARN Dropbox.</p><p><strong>The peer evaluation will be submitted electronically (using Microsoft Forms) no later than 11:59pm on the evening of the presentation. </strong>Feedback can be completed using a laptop during the presentation. Alternatively, feedback forms can be completed on paper, but the student must upload their responses to Forms by the deadline that same evening. Positive and constructive comments will be evaluated by the instructor and must accurately reflect the quality of the seminar. The peer evaluations (10%) will be combined with the instructor’s comments (25%) and will be provided anonymously to the presenter.</p><h4><strong>SCIENTIFIC REPORT (35%)</strong></h4><p>A written, scientific report is <strong>due on Friday, April 7th at 11:55pm</strong>. The report will be uploaded to the Dropbox on LEARN. Like the presentation, there should be enough background information so that the reader can understand the topic you selected and include a detailed literature review (minimum of 10 references) that supports how the problem has been identified and addressed thus far.</p><p>Overall, the paper must be at least 5 pages, but no more than 7 (double spaced; Font: Arial or Times New Roman; Margins: 1” all around; no condensed spacing). This does not include title page, figures, tables, and references.</p><p>This report should not simply summarize the literature but should show that you’ve thought critically about the topic and interpreted the findings of the papers you’ve read.</p><p><strong>Students are provided the opportunity to submit a one-page draft by March 24nd @ 10:00AM to receive constructive feedback prior to the full paper submission. Some things to keep in mind when considering this optional submission:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>This early submission is optional and provided as an opportunity to receive written feedback to help guide the remainder of the written assignment.</strong></li><li>Submission can be crafted in a method of your choice. Some examples might include bulleted format (full topic sentences with supporting bullets), rough framework, or a single fully written page from your current draft. However, it must be only one page and adhere to the formatting guidelines (1” margins, 12-pt font size, double spaced). Anything beyond one page will not be reviewed.</li><li>Feedback will be provided within ten days of your submission. Feedback may include suggestions on high-level spelling/grammar/sentence structure, content/organization of arguments, clarity, and/or tone of your document.</li></ul><p>While this is not required, it is strongly encouraged as an opportunity to improve your writing skills prior to your final graded work.</p><h4><strong>ATTENDANCE &amp; ENGAGEMENT (10%)</strong></h4><p><strong>In-person attendance is required in KIN 470</strong>. You will also be expected to actively engage during our classes (this looks like asking questions, offering ideas, active listening, participating in activities etc.). This may also include serving as a presentation chair/moderator to introduce peers during presentations. Your class attendance and engagement will be assessed throughout the term by the instructor. </p><h4><strong>QUALITY OF PEER EVALUATIONS &amp; SELF-REFLECTION (5%)</strong></h4><p>You will be required to submit peer evaluations for both the Short (Non-Specialist Audience) Presentation and the Long (Scientific) Presentation. For each presentation, you will be responsible for submitting feedback for 4 different presenters. In turn, you will receive feedback from 4 peers. An online Microsoft Form will be used to collect feedback. <strong>The peer evaluation must be submitted no later than 11:59pm on the evening of the presentations you are assigned to evaluate</strong>. Feedback can then be shared with each student anonymously. The quality of your feedback will be assessed and contribute to 5% of your overall course grade.</p><h4>OTHER COURSE INFORMATION</h4><p><i><strong>Individual-authentic work:</strong> </i>All graded assignments in KIN 470 are expected to be individual, authentically created work. Therefore, no sharing, collaborating, copying, or using classmates’ work (or previous cohorts’ assignments) on your assignments will be tolerated. </p><p><i><strong>Submitting files:</strong> </i>For written work, please submit assignments as PDF documents. For presentations, you are welcome to use and submit PowerPoint files. If you plan to use another technology, it is your responsibility to connect with me in advance to ensure I can open the file type on my computer. Your last submission to the LEARN Dropbox prior to the deadline will be graded. APA 7 will be used; proper referencing is expected for all graded submissions.</p><p><i><strong>Late penalty:</strong> </i>On all assessments, including peer-reviews, a penalty of 5% per day will be applied to all late submissions without documentation or <i>prior </i>discussions with the instructor. If you have a concern about a deadline, please reach out to discuss. </p><p><i><strong>Reviewing feedback</strong></i><strong>: </strong>I am happy to go over your graded work and provide clarification when needed. However, students must wait 24 hours after feedback has been returned before contacting me; during this time, students are encouraged to review and reflect on the feedback received. After 24 hours, students have up to 1 week (7 days) to contact me to ask for further feedback or clarification.</p><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<div>
<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as scientific literacy, literature search and review, and academic interpretation of research. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4><strong>COURSE COMMUNICATION PLAN</strong></h4><p><i><strong>Student (Office) Hours: </strong></i>It’s important to know that Student Office Hours are dedicated time for you! You are welcome to drop in with any questions you have, whether that be course related or more broadly about university life. I have scheduled our time for Thursdays 11:00am-noon, which appears to be the time when the greatest percentage of students are not enrolled in a class. Office hours will be held in my office (BMH 1042). If you need to connect outside of this time or want to discuss a more sensitive matter, please send me an email and we will make alternative arrangements together. </p><p><i><strong>Email: </strong></i>Feel free to email me if you have any questions throughout the course. I am here to help! I will do my best to respond within 48 hours during normal working hours (i.e., 8:30 AM – 4:30 PM Monday to Friday). However, please remember I am human! Sometimes I might be a little late or the email may get lost. If you don’t hear back within 4 working days, feel free to re-send your email with a friendly reminder. While I will do my best to answer your questions in a timely manner, please note that you should not expect to receive answers to emails on weekends, including the weekends before assignment due dates.</p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
