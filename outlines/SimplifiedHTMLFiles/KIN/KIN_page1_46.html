<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
</p>
<a></a>
<h2>
  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>Lectures will NOT normally be recorded or delivered online (e.g., over Zoom. MS Teams, etc.) – students should plan to attend all lectures in-person. </p><p> </p>
</div>
<a></a>
<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Online Resources</strong></p><p><strong>LEARN:</strong> Lecture notes and supplementary materials will be posted to LEARN. The instructor will use LEARN for all communications, please check your @uwaterloo.ca email address regularly or link your UW account to a 3rd party email service to stay up-to-date. <i>LEARN will also be used to administer pre-lab quizzes.</i></p><p><strong>MS Teams:</strong> There is a KIN 415 MS Team to support this course. The resource is intended as a contingency in case of a switch to remote learning. Students will be notified via email and LEARN if a switch to remote learning is necessary. MS Teams will also be the preferred format for 1-on-1 or small group meetings with the instructors if meeting outside office hours.</p><p><strong>Self-isolation</strong></p><p>If you test positive for COVID-19 or are told to self-isolate it is important that you communicate with your instructor(s) and complete the self-declaration of illness form on Quest. It is your responsibility to connect with your peers to get caught up on lecture notes. If your self-isolation period interferes with a due date for a course element (e.g., iClicker/attendance, midterm, presentation), then you must let your instructor(s) know so that they can have a discussion with you regarding a possible accommodation. </p><p><strong>Contingency Planning</strong></p><p>Ideally, KIN 415 will run in-person, as scheduled. In the event of a disruption to our ability to meet due to COVID-19 restrictions, the instructor will communicate a course continuation strategy via email and LEARN postings. The following contingency plans have been set to mitigate disruptions due to COVID-19.</p><p><strong>Long-Term Disruptions (whole group)</strong></p><p>If it is not possible to continue with in-person lectures for an extended period of time (i.e., more than 3 lectures) due to University-wide changes in public health guidelines or if the instructor must self-isolate, then KIN 415 will transition to pre-recorded online lectures. Lecture recordings will be posted to LEARN. </p><p><strong>Short-Term Disruptions (whole group)</strong></p><p>In the event of a short-term disruption to the meet pattern (i.e. 1-3 lectures), KIN 415 will transition to synchronous online lectures via MS Teams. Lectures will occur during regularly-scheduled meet times. Online synchronous lectures will be recorded and posted to LEARN. </p><p><strong>Individual Disruptions</strong></p><p>It will not be possible to record in-person lectures in anticipation of unexpected absences. <strong>You should reach out to peers and/or use posted lecture slides to catch-up on missed material.</strong> Please inform the instructor if you must miss multiple lectures due to self-isolation. In rare occurrences, it may be possible to include isolating students remotely, pending availability of necessary infrastructure. </p>
