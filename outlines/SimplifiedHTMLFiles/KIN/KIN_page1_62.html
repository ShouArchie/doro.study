<p>This student-driven seminar course is designed to provide an historical overview coupled with current research trends in biomechanics. Biomechanical concepts will be utilized in the assessment of normal, athletic and atypical populations encountered in sport and rehabilitation contexts. The major topics<br/>covered will vary from year to year depending on recent research activity and student interest.</p>

<p>Your course grade will be derived from four components:</p><p><i><strong>Seminar &amp; Discussion (30%)</strong></i></p><p>The majority of classes will be led by students. Topic selections will be completed in the first week of class, and guidelines will be presented during the term. </p><p><i><strong>Biomechanics Research Pitch (20%)</strong></i></p><p>The purposes of the research pitch are to identify an important research gap in biomechanics and apply knowledge in biomechanics, research design and methods to develop a state-of-the-art experiment that addresses the research gap. This assignment can be viewed as an initial pitch for an academic grant application, an application for an industrially funded contract, or a pitch to your employer for support. <strong>Students will submit their outline on LEARN by Monday, February 24th at 11:55pm</strong>. Further details regarding this assignment will be released throughout the term.</p><p><i><strong>Grant Proposal (30%)</strong></i></p><p>Students will expand on this research pitch into a full grant proposal. Depending on the nature of the research, students will select an appropriate funding agency and complete the requisite application. <strong>This submission will be due on LEARN by Monday, April 7th at 11:55pm. Further details will be released throughout the term.</strong></p><p><i><strong>Engagement &amp; Professionalism (20%)</strong></i></p><p>A great class relies on discussion. Please engage as an audience member, <i>with a focus on quality, not quantity:</i></p><ul><li>Examples of high level engagement include being prepared with pre-readings, conveying knowledge that is relevant to the discussion, listening to the opinions of others, and asking questions that encourage deeper understanding of biomechanics.</li><li>Examples of low level engagement include being unprepared for class, conveying limited knowledge or knowledge that is not relevant to the discussion, repeating material, difficulty listening to others (e.g., overtalking others), and not asking questions.</li></ul><p>Professional behaviours include attending class, punctuality, respectful interactions, ability to give and receive constructive behaviours and encourages the participation of others. Non-judgemental interactions are essential to professional behaviours.</p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as <strong>[fill this in with your discipline-specific skills]</strong>. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
