<p>All tests in this course, including quizzes, are closed book meaning that there is no access to study aids, other websites, notes- paper or electronic, permitted while completing those evaluations. Discovery of infractions will result in penalties in the course and will also be forwarded to the Associate Chair and Associate Dean for further evaluation and penalties. </p><p>All other assignments and papers are to be completed individually and not as a part of a group or team, unless explicitly directed.  </p><p><strong>Quizzes</strong> are 10 question, 10 minute evaluations covering content within the module that you are working on at the time.</p><p><strong>Tests </strong>will potentially consist of the following question types:</p><p>· Multiple choice and T/F</p><p>· Fill-in-the-blank</p><p>· Diagram labelling</p><p>· Matching</p><p>· Short answer </p><p>Test material will be based on lecture notes, content in LEARN.</p><p>You will be added to the 360 MS Team automatically by IST which will allow you to join any potential synchronous sessions, should they be necessary as a contingency, during the term.  </p><p>Concerns with marking or questions about tests, assignments and practicals must be addressed with your instructor within 1 week of the mark posting in LEARN. No further review is permitted after that time.    </p><p>More details on the <strong>video assignment and integrative paper</strong> will be released in LEARN closer to those deadlines.</p><p>Pertinent course content will be closed during the midterm test duration. There is no reweighting of assignment components, nor alternate make-up assignments. Grades in the course <strong>will not be rounded up to attain a specific GPA or mark for graduate school or any other reason</strong>. The mark you earn is what you will receive. </p><h3>Submission Times</h3><p>Please be aware that the University of Waterloo is located in the <strong>Eastern Time Zone</strong> (GMT or UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time) and, as such, the time that your activities and/or assignments are due is based on this zone.

Adjustment of due dates or deferrals of academic course elements are not automatic upon the self-declaration of illness or short-term absence. </p><p><a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">Academic Regulations and Accommodations</a></p><p>In addition to illness, there may be events that preclude students from meeting academic obligations. The following are examples of valid circumstances and required documentation that <strong>may </strong>warrant academic accommodation:</p><ul><li>A member of a varsity team travelling for competition: a letter/email from the Head Coach verifying the departure and return dates and times.</li><li>Death of a family member: a copy of the death certificate, a copy of the obituary or a link to the online obituary.</li><li>Travel: from time-to-time students are required to travel during an academic term for reasons NOT related to pleasure/vacation. If you are travelling and require accommodation, you must inform the instructor at least 2 weeks in advance of your travel, indicate the reason for travel and provide a boarding pass upon return to campus.</li></ul><p><strong>Important note:</strong> Travel that results in arrival to campus after the first day of class, absence before or after a reading break or departure from campus during the final exam period DO NOT warrant accommodation and any missed academic obligations will receive a grade of zero.</p><p><strong>Co-op Interviews</strong></p><p>Academic obligations take priority over co-op interviews. Whenever possible students are encouraged to swap interview times to avoid conflicts with academic obligations. If you swap interview times or you cannot find a student to swap with, you must complete an Interview Conflict form. Follow this link for more information on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/waterloos-co-op-process/interview-process/interview-process-and-procedures">interview process and procedures.</a> You can submit an Interview Conflict form by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Login to WaterlooWorks</li><li>Select 'Submit a form' from your dashboard</li><li>Select the category 'Pre and Post Interview support'</li><li>Select the sub-category based on your current situation. There are two sub-categories to choose from:</li></ol><ul><li>Interview Conflict - another student agreed to switch times</li><li>Interview Conflict - unable to switch times with another student</li><li>Interview location accommodation required - interview at UW interview site other than my home campus (for Architectural Engineering and Architecture students)</li></ul><p>    5. Complete and submit the form.</p><p>If none of these steps have worked and an interview conflicts with a lab or tutorial, you may request to swap lab/tutorial sections for only the day/week in question. Please provide your instructor a screenshot from WaterlooWorks such that your name, UW ID and the date and time of the scheduled interview are visible on the screenshot. If the interview was scheduled outside of WaterlooWorks, a letter/email from the prospective employer with the details outlined above will suffice. </p><p>If you're feeling overwhelmed with your interview schedule, you can contact your co-op advisor to discuss available options and/or fill out a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview#request-interview-relief">Request for Interview Relief Form</a> on WaterlooWorks. Depending on your situation, you may be able to choose to be removed from one or more of your upcoming interviews by having your job application(s) withdrawn.</p><p><strong>Accommodations</strong></p><p>False claims of illness or false claims of the circumstances outlined above and/or the submission of false supporting documentation of extenuating circumstances constitute an academic offence that will result in disciplinary action under Policy 71. </p><p>Adjustment of due dates or deferrals of term tests or final examinations are not automatic upon the presentation of suitable documentation. Instructors will use this documentation along with all information available to them when determining whether accommodation is warranted. When instructors elect to provide an accommodation, the options available to students vary based on the nature of the extenuating circumstances they are facing, and on the type of evaluation they were unable to complete on time. </p><p>There is no reweighting of material in this course as each component evaluates a unique component and material within the course. It is not equitable to other students to permit reweighting.           </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as exercise related interventions. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, <strong>is not permitted in this class.</strong> Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
