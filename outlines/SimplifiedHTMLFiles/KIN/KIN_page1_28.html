  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>KIN 327:</div>
<p>This course provides students with an understanding of the mechanical behaviour of human tissues, with specific emphasis on the musculoskeletal system. Students will learn how to describe the mechanical properties of specific tissues. Emphasis will be placed on understanding how tissues are structured to meet their functional demands, and how they respond to traumatic, dynamic impact events. In addition, the content will cover engineering interventions to reduce the risk of traumatic injury (e.g., helmets, sporting equipment, transportation safety features such as seat belts and airbags), and orthopaedic devices to treat traumatic injuries, their underlying mechanical properties, and how they interact with biological tissues/systems.</p>

<p>Quizzes will be performed online through Learn, on an <strong>individual basis. </strong>Quiz materials may not be copied and shared with others. The quiz with the lowest grade will be dropped, and will not be counted towards the final grade weighting.</p><p>Laboratory sessions will be performed as part of fixed, pre-defined groups. However, laboratory reports are expected to be completed independently and will be submitted on an individual basis. </p><p>The Group Final Presentation will be performed as part of your pre-defined group. All group members will receive the same grade. Equal contribution from all group members is expected. It is your responsibility to have up-front discussions within your group about expectations and work distribution. In rare circumstances, group members may be asked to provide perceptions of % contributions for each group member; these perceptions may be incorporated into grading. </p><p>Unless otherwise stated, quizzes will be open-book using only course materials and a calculator. The final term test will be closed book, with calculators as the only aid. More details will be provided in class and on Learn. </p><p>For lab assignments that are submitted late, a penalty reduction of 20% of the element’s mark total will be applied for each day past the element’s due date. </p><p><strong>Accommodations</strong></p><p>False claims of illness or false claims of the circumstances outlined above and/or the submission of false supporting documentation of extenuating circumstances constitute an academic offence that will result in disciplinary action under Policy 71. </p><p>Adjustment of due dates or deferrals of term tests or final examinations are not automatic upon the presentation of suitable documentation. Instructors will use this documentation along with all information available to them when determining whether accommodation is warranted. When instructors elect to provide an accommodation, the options available to students vary based on the nature of the extenuating circumstances they are facing, and on the type of evaluation they were unable to complete on time. </p><p>For circumstances deemed acceptable: </p><ul><li><strong>Quizzes will not be rescheduled. Only the best 4 of 5 quizzes are counted, so if you miss a quiz due to an acceptable circumstance, you will not be penalized. If multiple quizzes are missed due to acceptable circumstances, the weight of the quizzes over-and-above the first missed quiz will be transferred to the final term test. </strong></li><li><strong>Lab assignments. For in-term assignments, instructors may use their discretion and allow an extension. If the instructor does not grant an extension and an element is missed, the weight of the missed assignment will be transferred to the final term test. </strong></li><li><strong>Group Final Presentation. If a student misses this element, the weight of the missed assignment will be transferred to the final term test. </strong></li></ul><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Student Expectations</h4><ul><li>Students are expected to <u>regularly check the course LEARN</u> page (learn.uwaterloo.ca) for updates and course announcements.</li><li>Students are responsible for any course content that is delivered via LEARN (including lecture slides, assignments, and grading rubrics).</li><li>It is the responsibility of the student to take all necessary steps to find out about course changes including, but not limited to, online schedule, changes to schedules, announcements, and assignment instructions.</li><li>The instructor will only communicate with students via their official University of Waterloo email account. All email communications should include the course title in the subject line, as well as your full student name and ID number in the body of the text.</li></ul><p> </p><h4>Illness and Documentation </h4><p>From time to time, students will encounter extenuating circumstances such as significant illnesses, ongoing medical conditions, or religious observations that prevent them from meeting academic obligations. The University is committed to assisting students who experience these events.</p><p>In cases where students are required to miss class or class deliverables, they are required to follow policies with regards to documentation. This may include:</p><ul><li>Self-declaration of influenza-like illness</li><li>Self-declaration of short-term absence</li><li>Verification of illness form (VIF)</li></ul><p>Regardless of the nature of the absence or the form submitted, it is the student’s responsibility to notify their instructor(s) of their absence within 24 hours following a deadline/due date (but ideally beforehand). Failure to do so may result in late penalties or an accommodation may not be permitted. Adjustment of due dates or deferrals of academic course elements are not automatic upon the self-declaration of illness or short-term absence. In addition, <strong>it is the students responsibility to connect with their peers to get caught up on lecture notes or missed materials. </strong>Annotated lecture notes will not be provided by the instructor.  </p><p> </p><h4>Reading Week</h4><p>During Reading Week, instructors shall not schedule due dates for academic obligations (e.g., assignments, papers, lab reports, etc.). However, it is very likely that academic obligations (e.g., midterms, lab reports, etc.) will be scheduled in the week immediately following Reading Week, which means that students must adequately prepare during Reading Week. It is possible for an instructor and student to mutually agree upon a date during the Reading Week to complete missed academic obligations (e.g., writing a makeup midterm). </p><p> </p><h4>Contingency Planning</h4><ul><li>In the event of both short-term (e.g., one-week) or longer-term cancellation of in-person classes, whether for the particular course or University-wide, online lectures will be offered during the regular class period, or video of lecture materials will be uploaded for students to view asynchronously.</li><li>If an in-person final term test is not possible, it will be administered through the Learn interface.</li><li>Course elements may be cancelled with overall grade component weightings adjusted as appropriate.</li></ul><p> </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>While I would prefer you to not use GenAI for KIN327, I recognize it's potential value. If you do use it, I expect you to do so as a means to augment your efforts and enhance your learning experience (rather than using it to complete course deliverables). Please review and adhere to the paragraphs below.    </p><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><p> </p><h4>Intellectual Property Copyright Violations</h4><p>Academic integrity is a cornerstone of any educational institution. Students and faculty alike benefit when academic integrity is well understood, encouraged and maintained. The University and faculty strongly discourage students from participating in/uploading course materials on online sharing platforms, such as Course Hero, OneClass and similar platforms. In many cases, the material in question is created and owned by the faculty member or instructor. Faculty are indeed presumed to be the Intellectual Property Owners of the course materials. </p><p>Students are strongly advised to err on the side of caution and ask for permission from their instructors before sharing and/or distributing any course materials. These course materials will usually be made available only for personal use by students. Students may not distribute or reproduce the materials, whether for commercial purposes or not, without the express written consent of the faculty or instructor. Neither faculty nor the instructors waive their intellectual property rights when granting limited use of their course materials to students. </p><p>Uploading course materials, including lectures, quizzes, and exams, onto online sharing platforms such as Course Hero, OneClass, Facebook, Reddit, and similar platforms is considered to be a copyright violation, regardless of whether an individual did so intentionally or unintentionally. Ignorance of the law is not an excuse.</p><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as: </p><p>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof); </p><ul><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides); </li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and </li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner). </li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository). Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed written consent is considered a violation of intellectual property rights. Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p> </p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
