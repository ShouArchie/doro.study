  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Class Conduct:</strong></p><p>This is a large class but you are not a small part of it! To make our time together as valuable as possible, we both have to work hard at it. The following basic principles may give us some guidelines:</p><ol><li>Every student has the right to learn as well as the responsibility not to deprive others of their right to learn.</li><li>Every student is accountable for his or her own actions.</li></ol><p>In order for you to get the most out of this class, please consider the following:</p><ul><li>Attend all scheduled classes and arrive on time. Late arrivals and early departures are very disruptive and violate the first basic principle.</li><li>Please do not schedule other activities during this class time. I will try to make class as interesting and informative as possible, but I can’t learn the material for you.</li><li>Please let me know immediately if you have a problem that is preventing you from performing satisfactorily in this class.</li><li>Please refrain from carrying on separate conversations with your peers during class time. If it is urgent and cannot wait until class is over, please quietly excuse yourself from class so as not to disrupt the learning of others.</li><li>If your private discussion is related to class content please feel free to raise your hand and ask a question. Questions are an important part of the learning process and chances are other members of the class have the same question as you and would benefit from the clarification.</li><li>Please turn the ringer off your cell phone during class time so that it won’t be a disruption.</li></ul><p>I am looking forward to working with you this term.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Important Dates: </strong></p><p>Classes begin January 6, 2025</p><p>Last day to drop a class from the academic record (100% tuition &amp; fee refund deadline) January 24, 2024 </p><p>50% tuition &amp; fee refund deadline February 14, 2024             </p><p>Classes end April 4, 2024 – a Friday class schedule will be followed on April 8<sup>th</sup>.</p><p>On-campus exams begin April 9, 2024               </p><p>On-campus exams end April 26, 2024 </p><p>Holiday(s), no class(es): February 17, 2024</p><p>Reading Week: From February 15, 2024 to February 23, 2024 instructors shall not schedule due dates for academic obligations (e.g., assignments, papers, lab reports, etc.). However, it is very likely that academic obligations (e.g., midterms, lab reports, etc.) will be scheduled in the week immediately following Reading Week, which means that students must adequately prepare during Reading Week. It is possible for an instructor and student to mutually agree upon a date during the Reading Week to complete missed academic obligations (e.g., writing a makeup midterm). </p><p><strong>Important information about University of Waterloo resources and policies. It is your responsibility to read and understand the University of Waterloo’s policies. </strong></p><p><strong>Student Support</strong></p><p>You are a valued part of our community. We recognize that our individual identities shape our experiences in higher education. Some of us disproportionately encounter systemic barriers to belonging. University life can be difficult with multiple demands. The Faculty of Health is committed and actively working to foster an environment where you belong and can thrive. You may experience stressors that can impact your personal well-being and academic experience, but there are multiple supports and resources available to you on and off-campus. If you need help, these are links to many of the services available to support you: </p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/covid-19-vaccine-centre">UW COVID-19 Vaccine Centre</a></p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/">Student Success Office</a>                                         <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a></p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">Campus Wellness</a>                                                   <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Counselling Services</a></p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/services/uw-mates">UW MATES</a>                                                               <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services">Health Services</a></p><p><a href="https://wusa.ca/services/food-support-service">WUSA Food Support Service</a>                              <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/glow-centre-sexual-and-gender-diversity">Glow Centre for Sexual and Gender Diversity</a></p><p><a href="https://wusa.ca/services/womens-centre">The Women's Centre</a>                                            <a href="https://good2talk.ca/">Good 2 Talk</a></p><p><a href="http://here247.ca/">Here 24/7</a>                                                                 <a href="http://www.grhosp.on.ca/care/services-departments/mental-health-addiction/mental-health-emergency">Grand River Hospital Mental Health and Addiction</a></p><p> <strong>Illness and Documentation </strong></p><p>From time to time, students will encounter extenuating circumstances such as significant illnesses, ongoing medical conditions, or religious observations that prevent them from meeting academic obligations. The University is committed to assisting students who experience these events.</p><p><strong>Self-declaration of influenza-like illness</strong></p><p>Students must complete the illness/isolation declaration if they are seeking consideration from an instructor for missed course requirements due to influenza-like illness or self-isolation. <strong>This is a self-declaration available on Quest and is to be completed only for an absence related to an influenza-like illness or an absence as a result of a requirement to self-isolate</strong>. This form is to be used for an absence up to 14 days. Absences resulting from other conditions or longer than 14 days must be verified using the Verification of Illness form (see below).</p><p><strong>Self-declaration of short-term absence</strong></p><p>The Registrar's Office is piloting a short-term accommodation process. Students may experience short-term absences for several reasons for which they cannot participate or complete their academic responsibilities. For any assessments during the <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-The-Formal-Lecture-Period">formal lecture period</a>, students may self-declare their short-term absence within Quest using the Self-Declaration of Absence Form. Students will be permitted to self-declare short-term absence <strong>once</strong> per academic term, during the formal lecture period. A self-declared short-term absence will excuse students for up to 48 hours. <strong>The timing of which does not start when you submit your form</strong>. For example, if you declare a Tuesday as your first day absent, the Wednesday would be your second day and you would be expected to return to your studies on the Thursday (two full days absent; Tuesday and Wednesday). <strong>You are permitted to attend lectures, labs, tutorials, etc. However, you are not permitted to submit any assignments/assessments</strong>. For more information please visit the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences">self-declaration of short-term absence website</a>.</p><p><strong>Verification of illness form (VIF)</strong></p><p>For any non-influenza-like illnesses or health conditions, students are required to provide their instructors a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness form</a>. </p><p><strong>Regardless of the nature of the absence or the form submitted, it is the student’s responsibility to notify their instructor(s) of their absence within 48 hours of a deadline/due date</strong>. Failure to do so may result in late penalties or an accommodation may not be permitted. Adjustment of due dates or deferrals of academic course elements are not automatic upon the self-declaration of illness or short-term absence. </p><p><a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">Academic Regulations and Accommodations</a></p><p>In addition to illness, there may be events that preclude students from meeting academic obligations. The following are examples of valid circumstances and required documentation that <strong>may </strong>warrant academic accommodation:</p><ul><li>A member of a varsity team travelling for competition: a letter/email from the Head Coach verifying the departure and return dates and times.</li><li>Death of a family member: a copy of the death certificate, a copy of the obituary or a link to the online obituary.</li><li>Travel: from time-to-time students are required to travel during an academic term for reasons NOT related to pleasure/vacation. If you are travelling and require accommodation, you must inform the instructor at least 2 weeks in advance of your travel, indicate the reason for travel and provide a boarding pass upon return to campus.</li></ul><p><strong>Important note:</strong> Travel that results in arrival to campus after the first day of class, absence before or after a reading break or departure from campus during the final exam period DO NOT warrant accommodation and any missed academic obligations will receive a grade of zero.</p><p><strong>Co-op Interviews</strong></p><p>Academic obligations take priority over co-op interviews. Whenever possible students are encouraged to swap interview times to avoid conflicts with academic obligations. If you swap interview times or you cannot find a student to swap with, you must complete an Interview Conflict form. Follow this link for more information on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/waterloos-co-op-process/interview-process/interview-process-and-procedures">interview process and procedures.</a> You can submit an Interview Conflict form by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Login to WaterlooWorks</li><li>Select 'Submit a form' from your dashboard</li><li>Select the category 'Pre and Post Interview support'</li><li>Select the sub-category based on your current situation. There are two sub-categories to choose from:</li></ol><ul><li>Interview Conflict - another student agreed to switch times</li><li>Interview Conflict - unable to switch times with another student</li><li>Interview location accommodation required - interview at UW interview site other than my home campus (for Architectural Engineering and Architecture students)</li></ul><ol><li>Complete and submit the form.</li></ol><p>If none of these steps have worked and an interview conflicts with a lab or tutorial, you may request to swap lab/tutorial sections for only the day/week in question. Please provide your instructor a screenshot from WaterlooWorks such that your name, UW ID and the date and time of the scheduled interview are visible on the screenshot. If the interview was scheduled outside of WaterlooWorks, a letter/email from the prospective employer with the details outlined above will suffice. </p><p>If you're feeling overwhelmed with your interview schedule, you can contact your co-op advisor to discuss available options and/or fill out a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview#request-interview-relief">Request for Interview Relief Form</a> on WaterlooWorks. Depending on your situation, you may be able to choose to be removed from one or more of your upcoming interviews by having your job application(s) withdrawn.</p><p><strong>Accommodations</strong></p><p>False claims of illness or false claims of the circumstances outlined above and/or the submission of false supporting documentation of extenuating circumstances constitute an academic offence that will result in disciplinary action under Policy 71. </p><p>Adjustment of due dates or deferrals of term tests or final examinations are not automatic upon the presentation of suitable documentation. Instructors will use this documentation along with all information available to them when determining whether accommodation is warranted. When instructors elect to provide an accommodation, the options available to students vary based on the nature of the extenuating circumstances they are facing, and on the type of evaluation they were unable to complete on time. </p><p>For in-term assignments, instructors may use their discretion and allow an extension. If the instructor does not grant an extension and an element is missed, it is recommended that the weight of the missed element – an assignment, a laboratory report, or other evaluation mechanism – be transferred to similar types of elements due later in the term. If this option is not available, the weight of the missed assignment may be transferred to a test or the final examination. If students are granted an accommodation for a test, the weighting of the missed test is typically added to the final examination weighting or spread over the remaining tests. </p><p> </p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
