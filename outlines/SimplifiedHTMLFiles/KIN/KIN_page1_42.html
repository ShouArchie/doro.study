<p><strong>*</strong>I will adopt a flexible marking scheme when calculating your final grade. The course element that you perform the best on will pull 10% from another course element. For example, if you perform the best on the final exam and the worst on the midterm, then your midterm would be worth 25%, your group research project 30%, and your final exam 45%. These calculations will be done automatically at the end of the term using Excel.</p><p><strong>Lectures</strong></p><p>I will post incomplete lecture notes as PowerPoint and PDF files to Learn. You should add your own notes<strong> </strong>to the slides/pages as you follow along during the lectures. Throughout the term, there will be dedicated time in class to work on your group research project. Your attendance on these days is strongly encouraged so that you do not let your group down. </p><p><strong>Midterm</strong></p><p>The midterm is closed book and will start at 11:30 a.m. Eastern on Wednesday February 12, 2025 in BMH 1016. The details (e.g., length, content, type of questions, etc.) associated with the midterm will be discussed in class and provided on Learn. </p><p><strong>Group Research Presentation</strong></p><p>You will work in groups of 3 (some 2s or 4s) to complete a group research presentation. For scheduling purposes, there will be a maximum of 16 groups. The group research presentations will occur in our classroom during the scheduled lecture time on March 17, 19, 24, 26, 31 &amp; April 2. You will not be assigned a specific day to present. <strong>Every group must be prepared to present on March 17, 2025</strong>. I will randomly pick three groups to present that day. This pattern of randomly selecting groups will continue each of the remaining dates indicated above until all groups have presented. If your group is not prepared to present on the date that your group number is selected, you will lose 20% of your presentation grade. The presentations should be approximately 15-20 minutes in length <strong>(it is ok if you are a couple minutes over, but not under)</strong> and can incorporate PowerPoint slides and other presentation aids (e.g., demonstrations, handouts, viral Tik Tok videos, etc.). A complete description of the group research presentation expectations and rubric will be provided in class and on Learn.</p><p><strong>Final Exam</strong> </p><p>The final exam is closed book. The final exam will be scheduled by the Registrar’s Office and will fall in the Final Exam Period. More information regarding the length, format, content, etc. of the final exam will be provided in class and on Learn. The course instructor may adjust student grades at their discretion up until final grades are submitted. Students will be informed of any grade changes via email. </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of research and oral communication skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p><strong>Absences in Quest</strong></p><p><u>Religious or creed-related absence</u></p><p>Undergraduate students can now submit a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#religious">Religious Observance Self-Declaration</a> in Quest. This allows students to register the dates of potential conflict with coursework. As the dates of important religious observances are generally known well in advance, students must consult with their instructors within two weeks of the announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. </p><p><u>Short-term absence</u><strong> </strong>(once/term)</p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#short-term-absence">self-declare</a> one<strong> </strong>short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason (no documentation required). A short-term absence covers up to two calendar days during the <i>formal lecture period</i>. Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), and Studio (STU) courses/class components do not qualify for accommodation as a result of a self-declared short-term absence. There is no expectation that a self-declared short-term absence be total; that is, students may elect to participate in any course and complete any course element(s) despite not being required to. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><p><u>COVID-19-related absence</u><strong> </strong>(once/term)</p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#covid-19">self-declare</a> an absence of up to 10 days due to COVID-19-related illness. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in online components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Absences Requiring Documentation - </strong><a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/admin#/"><strong>Absence Database</strong></a></p><p><u>Absence due to illness  </u></p><p>When students are unable to meet academic obligations due to illness, they are required to complete the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances web form</a> (log in required) and upload their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/students/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/verification-of-illness-form-website-fillable-final_0.pdf">Verification of Illness Form</a> (VIF) to the site. The University of Waterloo Verification of Illness Form (VIF) is normally the only medical documentation accepted to support requests for academic consideration. Students should not submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to their instructors, teaching assistants, or advisors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able given their health condition. Once approved, the student and their instructors will receive a confirmation email of the student’s absence. Course instructors will determine how missed course components are accommodated.</p><p><u>Absence due to extenuating circumstances</u></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (bereavement, family illness, varsity sports, etc.), students are required to complete the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances web form</a> (log in required) and upload their official documentation (e.g., plane tickets, obituary, court documents, email from varsity coach, police reports, etc.) to the site. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact instructors within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able given their circumstances. </p><h4>Supports and Resources </h4><p>You are a valued part of our community. We recognize that our individual identities shape our experiences in higher education. Some of us disproportionately encounter systemic barriers to belonging. University life can be difficult with multiple demands. The Faculty of Health is committed and actively working to foster an environment where you belong and can thrive. You may experience stressors that can impact your personal well-being and academic experience, but there are multiple supports and resources available to you on and off-campus.</p><p><strong>Academic advisors</strong> - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-undergraduates/advisors">https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-undergraduates/advisors</a></p><p><strong>Association of Health Students Undergraduate Members (AHSUM)</strong> - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/association-health-students-undergraduate-members/">https://uwaterloo.ca/association-health-students-undergraduate-members/</a></p><p><strong>Athletics and Recreation </strong>- <a href="http://warriors.uwaterloo.ca/">http://warriors.uwaterloo.ca/</a></p><p><strong>Campus Wellness - Counselling and Health Services </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</a></p><p><strong>Co-operative Education -</strong> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/">https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/</a></p><p><strong>Empower Me - Student Assistance Program</strong> -<strong> </strong><a href="https://wusa.ca/services/empower-me">https://wusa.ca/services/empower-me</a></p><p><strong>Food Support Service </strong>– <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/food-support-service/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/food-support-service/</a></p><p><strong>Glow Centre for Sexual and Gender Diversity </strong>– <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/glow/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/glow/</a></p><p><strong>Good 2 Talk </strong>–<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.good2talk.ca">www.good2talk.ca</a> or 1-866-925-5454</p><p><strong>Here 24 Seven </strong>- <a href="http://www.here247.ca">www.here247.ca</a> or 1-844-HERE247 (1-844-437-3247)</p><p><strong>International Student Resources - </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/students/international-student-resources">https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/students/international-student-resources</a></p><p><strong>Off Campus Community</strong> - <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/off-campus-community/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/off-campus-community/</a></p><p><strong>Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-Racism </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/</a></p><p><strong>Office of Indigenous Relations – Student Supports and Clubs - </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/student-resources/student-supports-and-clubs">https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/student-resources/student-supports-and-clubs</a></p><p><strong>Racial Advocacy for Inclusion, Solidarity and Equity (RAISE) </strong>- <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/raise/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/raise/</a></p><p><strong>Student Financial Services </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/student-financial-services">https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/student-financial-services</a></p><p><strong>Student Legal Protection Program </strong>- <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-legal-protection-program">https://wusa.ca/services/student-legal-protection-program</a></p><p><strong>Student Success Office </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/">https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/</a></p><p><strong>UW Mates Peer Support</strong> - <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/uw-mates">https://wusa.ca/services/uw-mates</a></p><p><strong>University of Waterloo Information on COVID-19</strong> - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/">https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/</a></p><p><strong>Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) </strong>– <a href="https://wusa.ca/about/">https://wusa.ca/about/</a></p><p><strong>weCONNECTu Peer Mentorship Program (Faculty of Health) </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-undergraduates/first-year/mentorship-program">https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-undergraduates/first-year/mentorship-program</a></p><p><strong>Writing and Communication Centre </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/">https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/ </a></p><p> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
