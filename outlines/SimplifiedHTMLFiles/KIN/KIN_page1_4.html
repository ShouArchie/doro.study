<p><strong><u>Lab Attendance:</u> </strong></p><p>Attendance at your scheduled lab is mandatory. When you come to lab, you will need to sign in. Simply attending lab will be worth 1% of your final grade. If you have a valid reason for missing lab, you will need to complete the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9RoD5svYnQpL9k2"><strong>Form for Missing Lab</strong></a><strong> </strong>and attend another lab section or open lab review to cover the material. Otherwise, you will not receive the attendance mark. Since this grade category is worth 10% and there are 11 Labs, you are able to miss on lab without a valid reason and still receive full attendance marks.</p><p><strong><u>Pre-Lab Readings and Questions:</u></strong></p><p>Prior to each week of labs, you will be required to complete the section <i>Pre-Lab Reading</i> for that particular lab on Top Hat. There are several questions that you will need to complete for each Pre-Lab Reading. The questions are mostly in the form of Image Matching and Fill-in-the-Blank. At the end of the term, your lowest mark in this category will be dropped. The Pre-Lab Reading sections are all assigned at the beginning of the term. <strong>They are due at the beginning of the first lab of the week (Mondays @ 10:30am)</strong>. We will be dropping your lowest grade, so if you forget to complete it one week, it will be dropped from your final grade calculation.</p><p><strong><u>Post-Lab Assessments:</u></strong></p><p>Weekly Post-Lab Assessments are to be completed on Top Hat as soon as possible following your scheduled lab section. <strong>Assessments are available to be completed online at the end of the first lab section of the week until 4:30pm the following Wednesday </strong>(each assessment is available for 10 days).<br/><br/>Assessments must be completed individually, but you may use your notes as needed. You will be given questions related to the lab content that was presented in that same week. You will have 30 minutes to complete each assessment.

<p><strong>What to do if you are going to miss a lab:</strong></p><p>Please fill out the following form <strong>before</strong> the lab you will be missing: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9RoD5svYnQpL9k2"><strong>Form for Missing Lab</strong></a>. </p><p>Some valid reasons for missing lab include:</p><ul><li>Illness - for flu-like illness, you can self-declare on Quest (see below) for other see Verification of Illness section below</li><li>Varsity sports</li><li>Co-op Interviews (see below)</li><li>Death in the family (see below)</li></ul><p>Some non-valid reasons form missing a lab:</p><ul><li>Slept in/just forgot</li><li>Have to study for an exam or finish an assignment</li><li>Travel for pleasure OR early departure/late return from Reading Week</li></ul><p><strong>Missing an Exam:</strong></p><p>Absenteeism will be excused in the case of illness. Influenza-like illnesses must be self-declared on Quest prior to the start of the exam. The instructor must <strong>also</strong> be notified, via email, about your absence prior to the start of the exam.  Other reasons for absence must be discussed with the instructor <i>prior </i>to the examination. If a midterm is excused, weighting will be added to the final exam. <i><strong>No midterm re-write opportunities will be available</strong></i>. </p><p><strong>Illness and Documentation </strong></p><p>From time to time, students will encounter extenuating circumstances such as significant illnesses, ongoing medical conditions, or religious observations that prevent them from meeting academic obligations. The University is committed to assisting students who experience these events.</p><p><strong>Self-declaration of influenza-like illness</strong></p><p>Students must complete the illness/isolation declaration if they are seeking consideration from an instructor for missed course requirements due to influenza-like illness or self-isolation. <strong>This is a self-declaration available on Quest and is to be completed only for an absence related to an influenza-like illness or an absence as a result of a requirement to self-isolate</strong>. This form is to be used for an absence up to 14 days. Absences resulting from other conditions or longer than 14 days must be verified using the Verification of Illness form (see below).</p><p><strong>Self-declaration of short-term absence</strong></p><p>You are not able to use this self-declaration for LAB courses as per the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences">self-declaration of short-term absence website</a>.</p><p><strong>Verification of illness form (VIF)</strong></p><p>For any non-influenza-like illnesses or health conditions, students are required to provide their instructors a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness form</a>. </p><p><strong>Regardless of the nature of the absence or the form submitted, it is the student’s responsibility to notify their instructor(s) of their absence within 48 hours of a deadline/due date</strong>. Failure to do so may result in late penalties or an accommodation may not be permitted. Adjustment of due dates or deferrals of academic course elements are not automatic upon the self-declaration of illness or short-term absence. </p><p><strong>Important information about University of Waterloo resources and policies. It is your responsibility to read and understand the University of Waterloo’s policies.</strong></p><p><a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">Academic Regulations and Accommodations</a></p><p>In addition to illness, there may be events that preclude students from meeting academic obligations. The following are examples of valid circumstances and required documentation that <strong>may </strong>warrant academic accommodation:</p><ul><li>A member of a varsity team travelling for competition: a letter/email from the Head Coach verifying the departure and return dates and times.</li><li>Death of a family member: a copy of the death certificate, a copy of the obituary or a link to the online obituary.</li><li>Travel: from time-to-time students are required to travel during an academic term for reasons NOT related to pleasure/vacation. If you are travelling and require accommodation, you must inform the instructor at least 2 weeks in advance of your travel, indicate the reason for travel and provide a boarding pass upon return to campus.</li></ul><p><strong>Important note:</strong> Travel that results in arrival to campus after the first day of class, absence before or after a reading break or departure from campus during the final exam period DO NOT warrant accommodation and any missed academic obligations will receive a grade of zero.</p><p><strong>Co-op Interviews</strong></p><p>Academic obligations take priority over co-op interviews. Whenever possible students are encouraged to swap interview times to avoid conflicts with academic obligations. If you swap interview times or you cannot find a student to swap with, you must complete an Interview Conflict form. Follow this link for more information on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/waterloos-co-op-process/interview-process/interview-process-and-procedures">interview process and procedures.</a> You can submit an Interview Conflict form by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Login to WaterlooWorks</li><li>Select 'Submit a form' from your dashboard</li><li>Select the category 'Pre and Post Interview support'</li><li>Select the sub-category based on your current situation. There are two sub-categories to choose from:</li></ol><ul><li>Interview Conflict - another student agreed to switch times</li><li>Interview Conflict - unable to switch times with another student</li><li>Interview location accommodation required - interview at UW interview site other than my home campus (for Architectural Engineering and Architecture students)</li></ul><p>    5. Complete and submit the form.</p><p>If you are not able to resolve your interview conflict with a lab or tutorial, you may request to swap lab/tutorial sections for only the day/week in question. Please provide your instructor a screenshot from WaterlooWorks such that your name, UW ID and the date and time of the scheduled interview are visible on the screenshot. If the interview was scheduled outside of WaterlooWorks, a letter/email from the prospective employer with the details outlined above will suffice. </p><p>If you're feeling overwhelmed with your interview schedule, you can contact your co-op advisor to discuss available options and/or fill out a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview#request-interview-relief">Request for Interview Relief Form</a> on WaterlooWorks. Depending on your situation, you may be able to choose to be removed from one or more of your upcoming interviews by having your job application(s) withdrawn.</p><p><strong>Accommodations</strong></p><p>False claims of illness or false claims of the circumstances outlined above and/or the submission of false supporting documentation of extenuating circumstances constitute an academic offence that will result in disciplinary action under Policy 71. </p><p>Adjustment of due dates or deferrals of term tests or final examinations are not automatic upon the presentation of suitable documentation. Instructors will use this documentation along with all information available to them when determining whether accommodation is warranted. When instructors elect to provide an accommodation, the options available to students vary based on the nature of the extenuating circumstances they are facing, and on the type of evaluation they were unable to complete on time. </p><p>For in-term assignments, instructors may use their discretion and allow an extension. If the instructor does not grant an extension and an element is missed, it is recommended that the weight of the missed element – an assignment, a laboratory report, or other evaluation mechanism – be transferred to similar types of elements due later in the term. If this option is not available, the weight of the missed assignment may be transferred to a test or the final examination. If students are granted an accommodation for a test, the weighting of the missed test is typically added to the final examination weighting or spread over the remaining tests.          </p><p><strong>Student Support</strong></p><p>You are a valued part of our community.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
