<p>Students in this lab must provide proof of current First Aid, or equivalent, and CPR, or equivalent, by uploading their certification card to the Dropbox in LEARN. There is also a mandatory lab consent form to be completed within LEARN prior to starting labs. This course is designed to allow you to learn the skills and material without a large number of evaluations. As such we expect that you attend, be present i.e. not viewing social media during lab, and that you participate in all aspects of the course. Your wellbeing is my number one concern. You are more important than any quiz, midterm, percentage point or final exam. If you need help there are many services on campus to support you. If you need some assistance and you are unsure about how to access any of the services, please ask me and I will help you out or reference the links below in this document. </p>

<p>There will be narrated slides available in LEARN for the coming week that you must review <strong>in advance of the lab</strong>. This is your responsibility. There will also be other material available each week in LEARN that you may also have to watch, read or view prior to, and also during lab. We will review and demonstrate some tasks during lab but we anticipate that students have done the prep work in advance of lab. Failure to review the content will result in difficulty participating in labs.  </p><p>Quizzes will be based upon the material in LEARN. It is expected that you attempt the quiz each week.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-lab Quizzes</strong></p><p>These quizzes should be completed prior to lab each week in LEARN. We will monitor completion. </p><p>They are short, 3 question quizzes covering content in LEARN for the current lab. They may include multiple choice, true and false, multi-select, etc. There will be a time limit on each quiz. They are designed to ensure that you have viewed, digested and prepared for the lab by reviewing the weekly content in LEARN. </p><p>You will be added to the 140 MS Team automatically by IST which will allow you to join any potential synchronous sessions, should they be necessary as a contingency, during the term.  </p><p>Concerns with marking or questions about tests, assignments and practicals must be addressed with your instructor within 1 week of the mark posting in LEARN. No further review is permitted after that time.    </p><p><strong>What to do if you are going to miss a lab:</strong></p><p>Please inform the instructor via email if you are ill and also complete the online self-declaration form/VIF in Quest before missing the lab. Please see details below in the Administrative section. </p><p>If you have other reasons- coop interview, varsity sports, you must also inform the instructor via email, if possible, well in advance of missing the class to arrange an alternative solution. </p><p><strong>Winter Weather Contingency Planning:</strong></p><p>During the winter term, there may be days that the university closes due to inclement weather. To learn whether UW is closed, please visit the UW's homepage and the @uwaterloo Twitter channel, tune in to a local radio station, check local media websites or call UW's Infoline (1-866-470-0910).</p><p>If the university is <strong>closed</strong> at the time of your scheduled lab we will attempt to meet virtually via TEAMS, at the same time as we would meet in person. This may not be possible, depending upon the subject that week, but please check into TEAMS and LEARN for more direction at the time. </p><p>Please ensure you have, or wear, shorts and a t shirt each week for our palpation task. It would be wise to also bring a pair of clean indoor shoes to wear in the lab as we ask everyone to leave wet boots and shoes outside of the lab. </p><p>Please also bring a device to complete the quiz in LEARN each week. </p>

<p><strong>Student Support</strong></p><p>You are a valued part of our community. We recognize that our individual identities shape our experiences in higher education. Some of us disproportionately encounter systemic barriers to belonging. University life can be difficult with multiple demands. The Faculty of Health is committed and actively working to foster an environment where you belong and can thrive. You may experience stressors that can impact your personal well-being and academic experience, but there are multiple supports and resources available to you on and off-campus. If you need help, these are links to many of the services available to support you:                    </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/covid-19-vaccine-centre">UW COVID-19 Vaccine Centre</a></td><td><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a></td><td><a href="https://wusa.ca/services/womens-centre">The Women's Centre</a>            </td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/">Student Success Office</a>           </td><td><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services">Health Services</a></td><td><a href="https://good2talk.ca/">Good 2 Talk</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">Campus Wellness</a>    </td><td><a href="https://wusa.ca/services/food-support-service">WUSA Food Support Service</a>       </td><td><a href="http://here247.ca/">Here 24/7</a>              </td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/services/uw-mates">UW MATES</a>         </td><td><a href="https://wusa.ca/services/glow-centre-sexual-and-gender-diversity">Glow Centre for Sexual and Gender Diversity</a></td><td><a href="http://www.grhosp.on.ca/care/services-departments/mental-health-addiction/mental-health-emergency">Grand River Hospital Mental Health and Addiction</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Illness and Documentation </strong></p><p>From time to time, students will encounter extenuating circumstances such as significant illnesses, ongoing medical conditions, or religious observations that prevent them from meeting academic obligations. The University is committed to assisting students who experience these events.</p><p><strong>Student Absences – Accommodation for illness or other extenuating circumstances</strong></p><p>Students have the following three options for declaring an absence during the Winter 2025 term:</p><ol><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences">Short-term Absence</a> - a self-declared short-term absence will excuse students from their academic responsibilities for up to 2 consecutive calendar days during the <strong>formal lecture period</strong>. Students may choose to participate in some course activities that fall during the short-term absence, and still record an absence for other activity in that period. During the 2-day academic consideration period, the instructor cannot require completion of any of the missed academic responsibilities. Students must contact the instructor no later than 24 hours after the missed assessment(s). <strong>Self-declared short-term absences will not be accepted for the course/class components of Clinic (CLN), Laboratory (LAB), and Studio (STU)</strong>. No accompanying documentation is requested or required. Only <strong>one </strong>short-term absence can be self-declared per academic term. Thereafter, the student will be required to submit a University of Waterloo Verification of Illness Form (VIF) or register for academic accommodations with AccessAbility Services (depending on the nature of the reasons for the absence). <strong> Undergraduate students only.</strong></li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#public-health">COVID-19-related Absence</a> - an absence of 10 days or less due to COVID-19 related illness (including vaccination side-effects) or a requirement to self-isolate. Participation in online course elements may be reasonable. Students can self-declare <strong>one </strong>COVID-19-related absence in an academic term.</li><li>For absences that do not meet the short-term absence or COVID-19 criteria, for self-declared absences that exceed the maximum number permitted per term, or for (retroactive) reports of illness, students are required to submit the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness Form</a>. A high-quality photo of documentation should be uploaded to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Intake Form</a>.</li><li>Some students may seek academic accommodations on religious grounds. Students must consult with their instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought.</li><li>If the student’s absence is due to extenuating circumstances, they should use the VIF intake form via <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca">https://vif.uwaterloo.ca</a>. Students will be required to upload a PDF or high-quality photo of their documentation to the intake form.</li></ol><p><i><strong>Students are expected to notify their instructor(s) before or within 24 hours of the missed course element. The Verification of Illness Form should be submitted within 48 hours of the missed course element, if the student is well enough to do so.</strong></i></p><p>All faculties are using the Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Intake Form through <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca">https://vif.uwaterloo.ca</a>. Students will no longer be submitting their documentation to their instructors. Instructors will receive notification of the student’s reported absence. Please contact the associate dean, undergraduate studies should you have any questions about providing academic considerations and/or accommodations. </p><ul><li>If the student’s absence is due to extenuating circumstances, they should use the VIF intake form via <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">https://vif.uwaterloo.ca</a>.

The following are examples of valid circumstances and required documentation that <strong>may </strong>warrant academic accommodation:</p><ul><li>A member of a varsity team travelling for competition: a letter/email from the Head Coach verifying the departure and return dates and times.</li><li>Death of a family member: a copy of the death certificate, a copy of the obituary or a link to the online obituary.</li><li>Travel: from time-to-time students are required to travel during an academic term for reasons NOT related to pleasure/vacation. If you are travelling and require accommodation, you must inform the instructor at least 2 weeks in advance of your travel, indicate the reason for travel and provide a boarding pass upon return to campus.</li></ul><p><strong>Important note:</strong> Travel that results in arrival to campus after the first day of class, absence before or after a reading break or departure from campus during the final exam period DO NOT warrant accommodation and any missed academic obligations will receive a grade of zero.</p><p><strong>Co-op Interviews</strong></p><p>Academic obligations take priority over co-op interviews. Whenever possible students are encouraged to swap interview times to avoid conflicts with academic obligations. If you swap interview times or you cannot find a student to swap with, you must complete an Interview Conflict form. Follow this link for more information on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/waterloos-co-op-process/interview-process/interview-process-and-procedures">interview process and procedures.</a> You can submit an Interview Conflict form by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Login to WaterlooWorks</li><li>Select 'Submit a form' from your dashboard</li><li>Select the category 'Pre and Post Interview support'</li><li>Select the sub-category based on your current situation. There are two sub-categories to choose from:</li></ol><ul><li>Interview Conflict - another student agreed to switch times</li><li>Interview Conflict - unable to switch times with another student</li><li>Interview location accommodation required - interview at UW interview site other than my home campus (for Architectural Engineering and Architecture students)</li></ul><p>    5. Complete and submit the form.</p><p>If none of these steps have worked and an interview conflicts with a lab or tutorial, you may request to swap lab/tutorial sections for only the day/week in question. Please provide your instructor a screenshot from WaterlooWorks such that your name, UW ID and the date and time of the scheduled interview are visible on the screenshot. If the interview was scheduled outside of WaterlooWorks, a letter/email from the prospective employer with the details outlined above will suffice. </p><p>If you're feeling overwhelmed with your interview schedule, you can contact your co-op advisor to discuss available options and/or fill out a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview#request-interview-relief">Request for Interview Relief Form</a> on WaterlooWorks. Depending on your situation, you may be able to choose to be removed from one or more of your upcoming interviews by having your job application(s) withdrawn.</p><p><strong>Accommodations</strong></p><p>False claims of illness or false claims of the circumstances outlined above and/or the submission of false supporting documentation of extenuating circumstances constitute an academic offence that will result in disciplinary action under Policy 71. </p><p>Adjustment of due dates or deferrals of term tests or final examinations are not automatic upon the presentation of suitable documentation. Instructors will use this documentation along with all information available to them when determining whether accommodation is warranted. When instructors elect to provide an accommodation, the options available to students vary based on the nature of the extenuating circumstances they are facing, and on the type of evaluation they were unable to complete on time. </p><p>There is no reweighting of material in this course as each component evaluates a unique component and material within the course. It is not equitable to other students to permit reweighting.           </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as injury evaluation and taping. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
