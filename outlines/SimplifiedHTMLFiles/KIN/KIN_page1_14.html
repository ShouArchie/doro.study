  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>KIN 221:</div>
<p>The course is structured to introduce measurement, analytical, and computation techniques involving multi-segmental, dynamic analysis of human activity. Examples of human activity in occupational, clinical, and leisure settings from the perspectives of anthropometry, kinematics, kinetics, energetics, muscle mechanics, and electromyography are given. The utility of biomechanical variables in the solution of questions involving human movement.</p>

<p>All components in this course are to be completed independently with no collaboration/consultation/copying from others. All evaluations are closed book. If there are aids (e.g. equations) allowed, they will be provided with the quiz/midterm/exam. The power quiz is the only exception, where you may use a copy of your own completed power assignment. For all online calculation questions (quiz or midterm), you are expected to keep a record of calculations and be able to provide them immediately to your instructor upon request. Failure to submit calculations to a dropbox when instructed will result in no grade on the evaluation component. Online quizzes are not to be discussed with others until after the exam closes on LEARN (9pm). Accommodations for missed components are provided for each component below. In cases of long-term illness or multiple missed components, these accommodations may be modified at the discretion of the instructor.</p><p>Description of evaluation components follows.</p><p><strong>RLM quiz (on LEARN)</strong></p><p>This evaluation will be an online quiz on LEARN.</p><p>Missing this component due to illness or other conflict will result in the value of the component being split over the other two quizzes.</p><p><strong>Midterm #1</strong></p><p>This evaluation will be in-person, in class. (Check LEARN for your room location! You may be writing in a room different from our normal lecture location.) For those with time or other accommodations, arrangements must be made with AccessAbility Services.</p><p>Missing this component due to illness or other conflict will result in the value of the component being split over the other two midterms.</p><p><strong>EMG quiz (on LEARN)</strong></p><p>This evaluation will be an online quiz on LEARN.</p><p>Missing this component due to illness or other conflict will result in the value of the component being moved to the remaining quiz.</p><p><strong>Midterm #2</strong></p><p>This evaluation will be in-person, in class.

The exam is cumulative with a heavier emphasis on the latter part of the course. See the final exam schedule once released by the registrar’s office.</p><p>Missing this component due to illness will result in rescheduling to write a make-up version of the exam, at the instructor’s discretion. Only one chance to reschedule will be given.</p><p><strong>Online quizzes</strong> will not be returned to students; however students will have the opportunity to discuss those components privately with the instructor during online student hours. (This can be done confidentially in a breakout room.) Quizzes will be open on LEARN from 9am-9pm on scheduled days. Quizzes have specific time allotted for completion (see info in Announcements on LEARN) and once started, must be completed within the allotted time. Time allotted is more than twice the time needed to complete the quiz so no arrangements are required with AccessAbility Services for time accommodations on online quizzes. Note that support for quiz glitches/issues will be limited outside regular business hours. </p><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening

<p>
  Evaluation components will be reviewed for patterns of incorrect answers and answering a question that was not asked (there may be multiple versions of exam/quiz questions.)

You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
