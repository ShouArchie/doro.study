<div>
<div>KIN 221L:</div>
<p>This laboratory course provides students with advanced practical tools used in the biomechanical assessment of human movement. The labs have been designed to assist with students' knowledge and understanding of material discussed in the KIN221 lectures.</p>

<p><strong>Laboratory Instructions: </strong></p><p>KIN 221L lab instructions will be available on-line via LEARN. Each lab will have multiple resources to help you prepare and complete the lab. Prelab talks, will help orient you to the lab, how to videos are available to help you with calibrating and using equipment. Data will be collected and analyzed via MATLAB in the same manner done in KIN 121L. <i><strong>Read the lab material before you attend a lab. It is your responsibility to come to lab prepared. You are unlikely to complete a lab should you not come prepared, and your marks will reflect this.</strong></i> Please print the required material before attending labs or bring a device to lab to access the documents.</p><p>The laboratory exercises in KIN 221L are designed to give you advanced experience in the measurement and modelling techniques used in the field of biomechanics. The labs supplement the lectures and will provide a means for you to apply your knowledge in a practical manner. They will help you to identify the benefits and limitations of the experimental approaches used and provide you with a greater understanding of the topics covered in lecture. The materials covered in the labs represent experimental methods that are routinely performed in both clinical and research settings. The labs will therefore equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to work with these techniques after you have graduated from Kinesiology and Health Sciences at the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Each lab will contain a set of objectives. You will be expected to meet these objectives and will be tested on them throughout the course. The labs will use knowledge and skills gained from KIN 121 and KIN 121L. Further, the labs in this course will build on each other so you are expected to use the knowledge gained from prior labs to perform subsequent labs. </p><p>The labs will cover topics such as:</p><ul><li>EMG collection, processing, and analysis</li><li>Joint modelling concepts, muscle mechanics, force-length / force-velocity relationships</li><li>Dynamic versus static task analysis, including image analysis and multi-segment rigid link modelling</li><li>Problem solving skills</li></ul><p>The labs are designed to give you experience with the equipment and the signals you are measuring. You will make mistakes, and this is ok. It is part of the learning process and will ultimately help you gain a greater understanding of the topic at hand. </p><p>We are very fortunate to have access to the equipment and measurement techniques used in these labs. Many programs have limited staff and equipment for such purposes. Embrace this opportunity, as it is a unique one that will put you ahead of your peers at other institutions. </p>

The practical exam will be 10 minutes in duration. You will enter the lab and be asked to proceed to 1 of 5 stations, where you will perform the activities described by the examiner at that station. You will be graded on your activities and will be asked to provide oral responses to questions. Concurrent examinations will take place in each lab section, so please refer to the PDF document posted on LEARN towards the end of term for more details regarding the scheduling of the practical exam. <strong>Failure to attend your assigned Practical Exam time will result in a grade of zero on the exam. If you are ill during your exam time, follow the producers outline below, you may be required to complete the Lab Exam the next time the course is offered.</strong></p><p><strong>Lab Practical exams</strong> will occur on the following dates <strong>during your normal lab time:</strong></p><p> </p><ul><li>Sections 001 and 002               Tuesday, April 1 <sup>                  </sup>(9:30 AM - 11:30 AM)</li><li>Section 007                               Tuesday, April 1              (12:30 PM – 2:30 PM)   <sup>       </sup></li><li>Sections 003 and 004                Wednesday, April 2         (12:30 PM – 2:30 PM)</li><li>Sections 005 and 006                Thursday, April 3            (9:30 AM - 11:30 AM)</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Laboratory Work:</strong></p><p>It is very important that you attend the lab section in which you are registered. If you are not able to attend your lab section, you are asked to contact the head lab instructor in advance and provide a VIF or other appropriate documentation.  Failure to provide appropriate documentation will result in a mark of zero for the lab. All laboratory assignments are due 1 week after you attend the lab, by <strong>11:00 PM</strong>, and are to be handed-in to the corresponding dropbox on LEARN. All work submitted after that time will be <strong>deducted 20% per day</strong> with no exceptions, except as indicated below under the Illness and Documentation sections.</p><p>We understand that the laboratory data is collected and processed in a group setting and we encourage group discussions on laboratory topics. That being said, your laboratory write-ups should represent independent work. We will not tolerate students copying whole or part of others’ laboratory assignments. If you are working with classmates on the laboratory assignments, make sure that the work you hand in is independent and represents YOUR work only. You may work with your peers to seek out answers (e.g., finding websites, or text references). However, the creation of graphs/tables, written answers and all other submitted work associated with the lab report are to be completed by the individual. </p><p><strong>Handing in the work of others represents cheating and is a punishable academic offense. Data may be presented in the lab videos for demonstration purposes only, and you cannot hand in a lab report using this data without the written consent of the lab instructor.  Your lab reports must use the data you collected in the lab. Only your own group’s data is acceptable to use in your lab report</strong>. You will be reported to the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies for disciplinary action should you fail to adhere to the lab policies above.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Accidents and Injury in the Lab: </strong></p><p>The risk of injury while performing these lab activities is extremely small. However, if an accident does occur, it and any injury or safety concerns must be reported to the course Instructor that same day. These will be reported to the course instructor and will be acted on accordingly. If you feel that our actions do not satisfactorily address your safety concerns, you should report them to the Associate Chair for Undergraduate Studies (Dr. Chris Vigna) or the Undergraduate Program Manager (Lee Chandler).</p><p> </p>

The following are examples of valid circumstances and required documentation that <strong>may </strong>warrant academic accommodation:</p><p> </p><ul><li>A member of a varsity team travelling for competition: a letter/email from the Head Coach verifying the departure and return dates and times.</li><li>Death of a family member: a copy of the death certificate, a copy of the obituary or a link to the online obituary.</li><li>Travel: from time-to-time students are required to travel during an academic term for reasons NOT related to pleasure/vacation. If you are travelling and require accommodation, you must inform the instructor at least 2 weeks in advance of your travel, indicate the reason for travel and provide a boarding pass upon return to campus.</li></ul><p><strong>Important note:</strong> Travel that results in arrival to campus after the first day of class, absence before or after a reading break or departure from campus during the final exam period DO NOT warrant accommodation and any missed academic obligations will receive a grade of zero.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Co-op Interviews</strong></p><p>Academic obligations take priority over co-op interviews. Whenever possible students are encouraged to swap interview times to avoid conflicts with academic obligations. For details and procedures on what to do if you have an interview conflict, please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts">Interview Conflict</a> page on UW’s website.</p><p> </p><p>If you are not able to resolve your interview conflict with a lab or tutorial, you may request to swap lab/tutorial sections for only the day/week in question. Please provide your instructor a screenshot from WaterlooWorks such that your name and the date and time of the scheduled interview are visible. If the interview was scheduled outside of WaterlooWorks, a letter/email from the prospective employer with the details outlined above will suffice. </p><p> </p><p>If you're feeling overwhelmed with your interview schedule, you can contact your co-op advisor to discuss available options and/or fill out a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview#request-interview-relief">Request for Interview Relief Form</a> on WaterlooWorks. Depending on your situation, you may be able to choose to be removed from one or more of your upcoming interviews by having your job application(s) withdrawn.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Illness and Documentation </strong></p><p>From time to time, students will encounter extenuating circumstances such as significant illnesses, ongoing medical conditions, or religious observations that prevent them from meeting academic obligations. The University is committed to assisting students who experience these events.</p><p><strong>COVID-19 Related Absence</strong></p><p>Students must complete the illness/isolation declaration if they are seeking consideration from an instructor for missed course requirements due to COVID-19 or self-isolation. This is a self-declaration available on Quest and is to be completed only for an absence related to an COVID-19 related illness or an absence as a result of a requirement to self-isolate. <strong>The number of self-declared COVID-19-related absences is limited to one per student per academic term</strong>. Absences resulting from other conditions or longer than 14 days must be verified using the Verification of Illness form (see below).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Self-declaration of short-term absence (2 days)</strong></p><p><i><strong><u>Students cannot use their short-term self-declared absence for accommodations related to classes scheduled with a component of Laboratory (LAB) or Clinic (CLN).</u> </strong></i>For more information please visit the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences">self-declaration of short-term absence website</a>.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Verification of illness form (VIF)</strong></p><p>For other illnesses or health conditions, students are required to provide their instructors a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness form</a>. </p><p><strong>Regardless of the nature of the absence or the form submitted, it is the student’s responsibility to notify their instructor(s) of their absence within 48 hours of a deadline/due date</strong>. Failure to do so will result in late penalties or an accommodation may not be permitted. Adjustment of due dates or deferrals of academic course elements are not automatic upon the self-declaration of illness or short-term absence. </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
