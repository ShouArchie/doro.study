  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>KIN 204L:</div>
<p>This laboratory course provides the student with some of the practical tools used in movement assessment and exercise prescription. The labs have been designed to develop students' practical skills and understanding of material discussed in the KIN204 lectures.</p>
<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>KIN 204L is a laboratory course designed to complement the KIN 204 lecture. The lecture and laboratory are two separate courses on Quest and Learn, taught by separate instructors, but there is substantial overlap of content. Keep in mind that lecture and laboratory material do not necessarily coincide exactly week-to-week, as some distinct topics are covered in each course (lecture and laboratory). Laboratory and lecture material, though complementary to one another, are each examined separately. </p>
</div>
<a></a>
<h2>
  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Establish a professional relationship with a client and use appropriate tools to gather information to assess the status of the client as it relates to exercise, movement, and health.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Proficiently perform measurements and assessments of body composition, mobility and flexibility, cardiovascular function, muscular strength, endurance, and power, movement patterning, and balance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Understand how to interpret results of assessments to help guide exercise prescriptions. Recognize the appropriate range of normal values (both observed and measured) for select assessment results.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div>
<p>Students who wish to pursue certification as a Personal Trainer through the Canadian Society of Exercise Physiology (CSEP-CPT) may choose to do so in addition to the 204/204L curriculum.  Additional preparation and testing will be required.  More information will be provided at the start of the term. </p>

<p><strong><u>Attendance at labs is MANDATORY. </u></strong></p><p>If you do not attend your lab, you will <u>not receive any marks for that lab</u>.  This includes marks for preparation and participation, assessment data sheets, post-lab quizzes, and assignments.  You may complete the post-lab quiz or assignment for practice and feedback, but no marks will be given. </p><p><strong>If more than 20% of labs (2 labs) are missed throughout the term, <u>for any reason,</u> you will not receive a credit for KIN 204L. </strong></p><p>Students who arrive <u>more than 15 minutes late</u> will be allowed to stay for the duration of the lab but will not receive any marks for that lab or it's associated components, including the post-lab quiz or assignment. </p><p><strong><u>Lab Preparation and Participation (10% of final grade): </u> </strong></p><p>Your preparation and participation mark will be composed of the following: </p><p><strong>1) Preparation Questions: </strong></p><p>Prior to the lab, you are expected to read the material in the lab manual and to review the accompanying videos and supplemental documents so that you come to lab well-prepared to perform the procedures indicated in the lab manual and activity document. To help you review the material and better prepare you for the activities you will carry out in lab, you will be asked to complete a few questions prior to lab. The questions can be found in the lab activity document. <u>You will discuss your responses to these questions with your TAs and classmates at the beginning of lab.</u>  </p><p><strong>2) Skills Checks: </strong></p><p>The laboratory exercises are interactive experiences that are designed to teach and improve technical hands-on assessment skills. Participation in the lab is imperative for learning how to administer the assessments and to accurately collect and interpret the data. Throughout many of the labs, you will demonstrate a skill/task to one of the laboratory instructors or teaching assistants. The benefit of this is 2-fold: it will ensure proper assessment techniques are being performed, and it will help to familiarize you with demonstrating and being “evaluated” to better prepare you for the practical exams.  This is a learning experience to help you gain confidence and maintain composure when in a testing situation. </p><p><strong>3) Professionalism: </strong></p><p>Punctuality: Be <u>in the lab</u> and ready to go <u>prior</u> to the start time. This includes giving yourself enough time to change, check in, and wash your hands prior to lab.  </p><p>Organization &amp; Preparedness:  Be prepared to perform procedures indicated in the manual and lab activity.  You should have read your lab manual and taken notes on the protocols. Upon arriving, you should have your lab manual open and all materials (including your KIN kit and appropriate clothing) that are required for the lab</p><p>Appropriate attire: Wear exercise clothing as specified in the lab manual. Indoor running shoes and the name tag provided in your first year will always be required.  </p><p>Completion of Lab Activity Document: Accurately and completely record data from your client on the provided data collection sheets. Data collected from the Activity Document will be needed to complete the quizzes as well as post-lab submissions and assignments.  </p><p><strong><u>Post-Lab Submissions, Quizzes, and Assignments (60% of final grade)</u></strong> </p><p>As a follow-up to each lab, you will have a quiz and post-lab submission (worth 3% each), or an assignment (worth 6%).  </p><p><strong>Post-Lab submissions</strong> will be prompted with a question at the end of your lab activity document and will be submitted to the dropbox.  The submissions require you to summarize your results and client interaction, and use your results to develop selected components of an exercise prescription.  The purpose of these post lab activities is to reflect and practice thinking critically about the results you have collected and reinforce what was learned in the lab that week. You will also practice communicating the results formally to your client.</p><p><strong>Online quizzes</strong> are designed to check your knowledge.  Quizzes consist of approximately 10 questions.  You are given 30 minutes to complete the quiz. </p><p>Some labs (body composition, cardiovascular assessment, exercise prescription) have a <strong>post-lab assignment</strong> instead of a quiz and a summary. Assignment submissions must be uploaded as a PDF document to Learn.  Post-lab analyses and writing should be done individually, without the use of generative AI. You may work with your peers to seek out answers (e.g., finding websites, or text references), however the creation of the graphs, tables, written answers, and all other submitted work associated with the lab analyses are to be completed by you as an individual. </p><p><strong>Each dropbox and quiz will open at the end of your lab time and will be open for <u>one week</u>. Post-lab submissions, quizzes, and assignments are due one week from your lab, by 11:00 pm</strong>.  It is strongly recommended that you complete your quizzes, submissions, and assignments shortly after your lab and before the need to prepare for next week’s lab activities. Extensions will not be provided unless extenuating circumstances are appropriately </p><p><strong>It is your responsibility to ensure that you have a reliable internet connection when initiating the quiz or submitting the summary</strong>. <strong>You have only one attempt.  Once a quiz is open, it will not be re-set. Quizzes will not be reset or re-weighted because of technical difficulties or for any other reason.   </strong></p><p><strong>You must check that the correct file was properly uploaded and submitted to the correct dropbox.  Correct submissions are confirmed with a submission receipt from Learn, to your .uwaterloo email address. Summaries submitted after the due date will have 20% deducted for every day that they are late</strong>.</p><p>Using ChatGPT (or similar tools that generate text, code, or visual images) for content generation and submitting it as one’s own original work is a violation of the University of Waterloo’s Policy 71 (Student Discipline). Use of these tools may be explicitly permitted by an instructor (as stated in assignment guidelines or a course outline, for example) for teaching and learning purposes that do not include claiming AI-generated output as original work.</p><p><strong><u>Practical Lab Exam (30% of final grade): </u> </strong></p><p>The main objective of KIN 204L is to develop hands-on skills necessary to assess a client’s movement and the various components of fitness. Evaluation during the practical exams is based on your ability to carry out various assessment procedures while communicating and interacting with the client in a professional manner. More details will be provided leading up to the practical exam. You will be scheduled a timeslot within your lab time and must attend your scheduled practical exam. <strong>Failure to attend your designated testing time will result in a mark of zero on that exam. </strong> </p>

<p>
  Generative AI: <br/><br/>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as understanding testing methods and results, summarizing client interactions, synthesizing information to assess an individual's health and fitness, and developing individual goals and action plans. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of Policy 71 (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (ICAI, n.d.). <br/><br/>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. <br/><br/>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence <br/><br/>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: <br/><br/>Student Success Office for help with skills like notetaking and time management<br/>Writing and Communication Centre for assignments with writing or presentations<br/>AccessAbility Services for documented accommodations<br/>Library for research-based assignments

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
