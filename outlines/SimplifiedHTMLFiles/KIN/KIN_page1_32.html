  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>KIN 351:</div>
<p>This course will develop theoretical knowledge and practical skills in the rehabilitation of orthopedic injuries. The course will build upon knowledge related to orthopedic injuries gained in core and elective courses. The focus will be on a population that was active and healthy prior to injury.</p>
<div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>This course is designed to develop theoretical knowledge and practical skills related to rehabilitation of orthopedic conditions and injuries. Lecture material will be comprised of recorded lectures in LEARN. The lectures are based upon several different sources, including the recommended text. I will provide narrated lecture slides in LEARN in video form for downloading and/or viewing along with ppt slides of the video lecture. It is expected that you view/make notes on said lectures and slides in advance of the in person labs each week. Evaluations will take place during our designated lecture time so please do not make other arrangements or commitments during this time for other courses, jobs, etc. as we will not accommodate you for those circumstances. </p><p>During lab periods, at which attendance is 100% mandatory, you will complete practical skills. Due to the number of students and the allotted space, there is no switching of lab sections. Please note that you cannot use<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp"> STA for labs per UW policy</a>. </p><p>LEARN is arranged in modules by topic/by week. I will make the modules available in LEARN later in the week for the upcoming week so you have time to prepare for lab. Please refer to the schedule above for a general timeline, which is subject to minor changes as we proceed. There are some hard deadlines to follow, such as the quiz dates and test dates, that will remain static.    </p><p>You will be added to the 351 MS Team automatically by IST which will allow you to join any potential synchronous sessions, should they be necessary as a contingency, during the term.  </p><p>Concerns with marking or questions about tests, assignments and practicals must be addressed with your instructor within 1 week of the mark posting in LEARN. No further review is permitted after that time.    </p><p>* It is assumed that students are familiar with the pertinent anatomy and orthopedic conditions. There will be a very brief review of each area, but anyone NOT familiar with the anatomy, at the level it is being discussed, is strongly encouraged to consult an anatomy textbook, review course notes or the course text. Anatomy is CRITICAL in this course. A base level of knowledge and skills related to exercise instruction and prescription is also assumed from KIN 204. Also note that we will be covering the management of conditions covered in KIN 340 so it is expected that you are familiar with those injuries. If not please refer to previous notes and slides from KIN 340.  </p><p> </p>

<p role="note">Influenza-like illnesses must be self-declared on Quest prior to the start of the exam for consideration for accommodations- see details below in the  Administration section. The instructor must also be notified, via email, about your absence prior to the start of the exam.  Other reasons for absence must be discussed with the instructor prior to the examination for consideration. <br/>* Grades in the course will not be rounded up to the next GPA for any reason- applications to graduate school, overall GPA, etc. The mark you earn via evaluations is what you will receive. <br/>* N.B. If you miss multiple labs or quizzes/tests you will not attain the credit for this course.<br/>*There is no reweighting of evaluations, they must all be completed as each evaluates a specific component and series of tasks. There are no alternate or extra assignments. </p>

<div></div>
<div>
<h4><strong>Evaluation Details</strong></h4><p><strong>Submissions</strong> are individual, not group efforts, unless specifically indicated in the description of the submission- e.g. Submission #5. Submissions will be outlined and communicated in lab. Submissions are via the Dropbox or Video Assignment. Late submissions, beginning immediately past the due date/time, will incur a penalty of 20% per day up to 2 days, after which you will receive a grade of 0. Please submit well in advance of the deadline.</p><p><strong>Quizzes and tests </strong>will be completed in LEARN, during lab and lecture time, in person, so please ensure your electronic device- laptop, tablet, phone, is updated, powered, connected to Eduroam, and ready to go for each session and test. They are<strong> 7 question quizzes </strong>on the content covered in LEARN each week including lectures, videos and readings, to name a few. You must be in person to complete each quiz. Quizzes completed outside of lab will be graded as 0. Quizzes are weekly in an effort to reduce the cognitive load on you and ensure that you have prepared for the lab in advance. There are no remote attempts of quizzes and tests unless arrangements are made with AA. For those registered in AA for testing, please coordinate and arrange your test date/times early in the term. These should be at the same time/date as all others in the class per the schedule. You must have a device to complete the quiz on during the lab or lecture time slot. Failure to bring a device will result in a grade of 0 for that evaluation. </p><p>Tests will potentially consist of the following question types:</p><p>· Multiple choice and T/F</p><p>· Fill-in-the-blank</p><p>· Diagram labelling</p><p>· Matching</p><p>· Short answer </p><p>Test material will be based on lecture notes, content in LEARN and any skills and material covered during labs.  Tests are in-person and closed book. No aids or other resources are allowed. More details will be provided in class and on Learn. </p><p><strong>The practical exam</strong> will take place during your usual lab time at the end of the semester. More details to follow closer to the date.  </p><p><i><strong>100% Attendance is expected for all labs.</strong></i><strong> </strong>There is no room for switching lab sections. If you miss a lab due to a self declared absence in Quest, you may be required to submit a project to replace the attendance/participation for that week's missed lab, at the instructor's discretion. The date and nature of the submission will be determined by the instructor at the time of the missed lab. You are required to complete any missed prelab quizzes prior to the next lab session. There is no reweighting of any evaluation components as they each test a specific, separate component in the course. </p><p><strong>What to do if you are going to miss a lab:</strong></p><p>Please inform the instructor via email that you are ill and will miss the lab <strong>prior</strong> to the lab, and also complete the <strong>self declaration of illness form in Quest before your lab- more details below</strong>. You may be required, at the instructors discretion, to complete an alternate assignment if a lab is missed and we are unable to accommodate you in another lab. This is not applicable for other situations of absence. </p><p>If you have to miss because of another unavoidable reason- coop interviews, varsity game, etc. please inform the instructor via email, well in advance of the missed lab, to determine if we can facilitate an alternate solution. Academic commitments should be considered paramount when booking coop appointments so please work around classes and labs when booking interviews.</p><p><strong>Missing a Test:</strong></p><p>Influenza-like illnesses must be self-declared on Quest prior to the start of the exam. The instructor must <strong>also</strong> be notified, via email, about your absence prior to the start of the exam.  Other reasons for absence must be discussed with the instructor <i>prior </i>to the examination. Please see more info below in the Administrative section. </p><p><strong>Winter Weather Contingency Planning:</strong></p><p>During the winter term, there may be days that the university closes due to inclement weather. To learn whether UW is closed, please visit the UW's homepage and the @uwaterloo X/Twitter channel, tune in to a local radio station, check local media websites or call UW's Infoline (1-866-470-0910).</p><p>If the university is <strong>closed</strong> at the time of your scheduled lab we will attempt to meet in TEAMS at the same time as your normally scheduled lab. This means, for attendance and participation, you would be required to join the meeting and 'attend' the session with your camera turned on. Depending upon the activities you may be required to submit an assignment as a part of the lab that week, TBD. </p><p>There are no bonus assignments, make up tests, etc. Each component of the evaluations must be completed. There is no reweighting of material as each evaluation is covering unique and distinct parts of the course. </p>
</div>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links, specifically for the use of AI.<br/>
</p>

<h2>
  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>Activities for this course involve recording, in partial fulfillment of the course learning outcomes.  You will receive notification of recording via at least one of the following mechanisms: within the Learning Management System (LEARN), a message from your course instructor, course syllabus/website, or other means.

<h4><strong>Student Support</strong></h4><p>You are a valued part of our community. We recognize that our individual identities shape our experiences in higher education. Some of us disproportionately encounter systemic barriers to belonging. University life can be difficult with multiple demands. The Faculty of Health is committed and actively working to foster an environment where you belong and can thrive. You may experience stressors that can impact your personal well-being and academic experience, but there are multiple supports and resources available to you on and off-campus. If you need help, these are links to many of the services available to support you:                    </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/covid-19-vaccine-centre">UW COVID-19 Vaccine Centre</a></td><td><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a></td><td><a href="https://wusa.ca/services/womens-centre">The Women's Centre</a>            </td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/">Student Success Office</a>           </td><td><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services">Health Services</a></td><td><a href="https://good2talk.ca/">Good 2 Talk</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">Campus Wellness</a>    </td><td><a href="https://wusa.ca/services/food-support-service">WUSA Food Support Service</a>       </td><td><a href="http://here247.ca/">Here 24/7</a>              </td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/services/uw-mates">UW MATES</a>         </td><td><a href="https://wusa.ca/services/glow-centre-sexual-and-gender-diversity">Glow Centre for Sexual and Gender Diversity</a></td><td><a href="http://www.grhosp.on.ca/care/services-departments/mental-health-addiction/mental-health-emergency">Grand River Hospital Mental Health and Addiction</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Illness and Documentation </strong></p><p>From time to time, students will encounter extenuating circumstances such as significant illnesses, ongoing medical conditions, or religious observations that prevent them from meeting academic obligations. The University is committed to assisting students who experience these events.</p><p><strong>Student Absences – Accommodation for illness or other extenuating circumstances</strong></p><ol><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences">Short-term Absence</a> - a self-declared short-term absence will excuse students from their academic responsibilities for up to 2 consecutive calendar days during the <strong>formal lecture period</strong>. Students may choose to participate in some course activities that fall during the short-term absence, and still record an absence for other activity in that period. During the 2-day academic consideration period, the instructor cannot require completion of any of the missed academic responsibilities. Students must contact the instructor no later than 24 hours after the missed assessment(s). <strong>Self-declared short-term absences will not be accepted for the course/class components of Clinic (CLN), Laboratory (LAB), and Studio (STU). </strong>No accompanying documentation is requested or required. Only <strong>one </strong>short-term absence can be self-declared per academic term. Thereafter, the student will be required to submit a University of Waterloo Verification of Illness Form (VIF) or register for academic accommodations with AccessAbility Services (depending on the nature of the reasons for the absence). <strong> Undergraduate students only.</strong></li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#public-health">COVID-19-related Absence</a> - an absence of 10 days or less due to COVID-19 related illness (including vaccination side-effects) or a requirement to self-isolate. Participation in online course elements may be reasonable. Students can self-declare <strong>one </strong>COVID-19-related absence in an academic term.</li><li>For absences that do not meet the short-term absence or COVID-19 criteria, for self-declared absences that exceed the maximum number permitted per term, or for (retroactive) reports of illness, students are required to submit the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness Form</a>. A high-quality photo of documentation should be uploaded to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Intake Form</a>.</li><li>Some students may seek academic accommodations on religious grounds. Students must consult with their instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought.</li><li>If the student’s absence is due to extenuating circumstances, they should use the VIF intake form via <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca">https://vif.uwaterloo.ca</a>. Students will be required to upload a PDF or high-quality photo of their documentation to the intake form.</li></ol><p>All faculties are using the Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Intake Form through <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca">https://vif.uwaterloo.ca</a>. Students will no longer be submitting their documentation to their instructors. Instructors will receive notification of the student’s reported absence. Please contact the associate dean, undergraduate studies should you have any questions about providing academic considerations and/or accommodations. </p><p><i><strong>Students are expected to notify their instructor(s) before or within 24 hours of the missed course element.</strong></i> Failure to do so may result in late penalties or an accommodation may not be permitted. Adjustment of due dates or deferrals of academic course elements are not automatic upon the self-declaration of illness or short-term absence. </p><p><a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">Academic Regulations and Accommodations</a></p><p>In addition to illness, there may be events that preclude students from meeting academic obligations. The following are examples of valid circumstances and required documentation that <strong>may </strong>warrant academic accommodation:</p><ul><li>A member of a varsity team travelling for competition: a letter/email from the Head Coach verifying the departure and return dates and times.</li><li>Death of a family member: a copy of the death certificate, a copy of the obituary or a link to the online obituary.</li><li>Travel: from time-to-time students are required to travel during an academic term for reasons NOT related to pleasure/vacation. If you are travelling and require accommodation, you must inform the instructor at least 2 weeks in advance of your travel, indicate the reason for travel and provide a boarding pass upon return to campus.</li></ul><p><strong>Important note:</strong> Travel that results in arrival to campus after the first day of class, absence before or after a reading break or departure from campus during the final exam period DO NOT warrant accommodation and any missed academic obligations will receive a grade of zero.</p><p><strong>Co-op Interviews</strong></p><p>Academic obligations take priority over co-op interviews. Whenever possible students are encouraged to swap interview times to avoid conflicts with academic obligations. If you swap interview times or you cannot find a student to swap with, you must complete an Interview Conflict form. Follow this link for more information on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/waterloos-co-op-process/interview-process/interview-process-and-procedures">interview process and procedures.</a> You can submit an Interview Conflict form by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Login to WaterlooWorks</li><li>Select 'Submit a form' from your dashboard</li><li>Select the category 'Pre and Post Interview support'</li><li>Select the sub-category based on your current situation. There are two sub-categories to choose from:</li></ol><ul><li>Interview Conflict - another student agreed to switch times</li><li>Interview Conflict - unable to switch times with another student</li><li>Interview location accommodation required - interview at UW interview site other than my home campus (for Architectural Engineering and Architecture students)</li></ul><p>    5. Complete and submit the form.</p><p>If none of these steps have worked and an interview conflicts with a lab or tutorial, you may request to swap lab/tutorial sections for only the day/week in question. Please provide your instructor a screenshot from WaterlooWorks such that your name, UW ID and the date and time of the scheduled interview are visible on the screenshot. If the interview was scheduled outside of WaterlooWorks, a letter/email from the prospective employer with the details outlined above will suffice. </p><p>If you're feeling overwhelmed with your interview schedule, you can contact your co-op advisor to discuss available options and/or fill out a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview#request-interview-relief">Request for Interview Relief Form</a> on WaterlooWorks. Depending on your situation, you may be able to choose to be removed from one or more of your upcoming interviews by having your job application(s) withdrawn.</p><p><strong>Accommodations</strong></p><p>False claims of illness or false claims of the circumstances outlined above and/or the submission of false supporting documentation of extenuating circumstances constitute an academic offence that will result in disciplinary action under Policy 71. </p><p>Adjustment of due dates or deferrals of term tests or final examinations are not automatic upon the presentation of suitable documentation. Instructors will use this documentation along with all information available to them when determining whether accommodation is warranted. When instructors elect to provide an accommodation, the options available to students vary based on the nature of the extenuating circumstances they are facing, and on the type of evaluation they were unable to complete on time. </p><p>There is no reweighting of material in this course as each component evaluates a unique component and material within the course. It is not equitable to other students to permit reweighting.               </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as manual therapy skills and exercise prescription Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is <strong>not</strong> permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
