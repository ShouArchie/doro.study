<ol><li><strong><u>Lectures and Tests (95% of final grade)</u></strong></li></ol><p>This class will be conducted using a “Hybrid” model. Lectures will not be delivered ‘in-person’, but rather will be made available online as pre-recorded segments that follow the Lecture Slide Decks. We will use the classroom for an optional "Meet and Greet" in the first week of classes, and to provide an option to watch Lorenzo’s Oil together. A copy of Lorenzo's Oil and notes for a 'self-guided watching' of the movie will also be provided online. </p><p>There are 9 lecture decks, and 5 associated tests worth 19% each of the final grade, for a total of 95% of the final grade. </p><p>The lectures have been subdivided into short recordings, to make it easier to download and watch them. All of the lecture content will be available online. There are detailed notes below the slides that accompany the recordings, to help you understand the course materials. <strong>In order to access all of the required content that you are responsible for in this course, you must review the slides, </strong><i><strong>and <u>also</u> read the notes below each slide</strong></i><strong>, in addition to watching the videos. </strong>Tests will be based on content in <u>the slides, in the notes, and in the videos</u>. </p><p>In the first 2 weeks, the lecture material covers how nutrition is studied, including limitations and unique aspects of the field, scientific writing and how scientific review papers are written, as well as gene-diet interactions, which are becoming common in studies on nutrition in humans. </p><p><strong>Test #1</strong> covers material from <strong>Slide Decks #1 and #3 </strong><i><strong>only</strong></i>. The material in <strong>Slide Deck #2</strong> <i>will not be tested</i>, but will be useful as you start to think about your AI Critical Evaluation Assignment. It is also a useful resource to help guide you in accessing and contributing to the scientific literature, which is an excellent way to enhance your understanding of topics you are curious about during your undergraduate studies, and in the years beyond!</p><p>In subsequent weeks, the lecture material has been structured to cover each of the macronutrients, as well as B12 &amp; folate as sample micronutrients, with an emphasis on understanding how each dietary factor can interact with metabolic physiology to create and treat disease. The lectures include historical information on how diagnostic mysteries were solved to uncover the causes of these diseases, and find rationale dietary therapies.</p><p>We will watch the movie Lorenzo’s Oil, which provides both a historical overview of the elucidation of the etiology of X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy, which led to an important therapy, and a medically accurate portrayal of the clinical development and course of the disease. A copy of the movie and notes for viewing will be available in D2L. </p><p><strong>Test #2</strong> will cover material from <strong>Slide Deck #4</strong> on Protein and Phenylketonuria.</p><p><strong>Test #3</strong> will cover material from <strong>Slide Deck #5</strong> on Fructose and Hepatosteatosis.</p><p><strong>Test #4</strong> will cover material from <strong>Slide Decks #6, 7 and 8</strong> on Lipid Biochemistry and Essential Fatty Acids, X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy, and on the Movie: <i>Lorenzo’s Oil</i>. There will be a small number of questions from the movie on this test.</p><p><strong>Test #5</strong> will cover material from <strong>Slide Deck #9</strong> on the masking of a B12 deficiency by folate, as well as other aspects of the metabolism and disease interactions of these vitamins. </p><p><strong>All tests will be available online in the Quizzes section of Learn for a period of one (1) academic week. Tests will open on the indicated date at 12:01am, and will close on the indicated date at 11:59pm.</strong></p><p>Tests are “<strong>open-book</strong>”, which means that you can use your notes from class while writing the test. <strong>However</strong>, you must complete the tests alone. You are <strong><u>NOT</u></strong> allowed to communicate or collaborate with others regarding the tests before, during, or after the tests. You are <strong><u>NOT</u></strong> allowed to make copies of the questions or otherwise record the test material, share the test material, or discuss the test material with others inside the class, or outside the class. </p><p><i>After a test, you are welcome to make an appointment with the instructor or TA to review you test questions and answers.  </i></p><p><strong>DROPPING THE LOWEST TEST MARK: I know that sometimes we all have a bad (test) day! Based on helpful student feedback and requests, a change has been made to the test grading scheme. If you complete all tests, your lowest test mark will be dropped from the overall test weighting. Thus, although each test is initially worth 19% in our grading scheme, giving the tests in this class a total assessment weighting of 95% of the final grade, your lowest test will be dropped from the grading scheme at the end of the term, and your other 4 better tests will be raised in proportionate value to have a weighted value of 23.75% </strong><i><strong>each</strong></i><strong> of the final mark. Thus, tests will still account for 95% of the final grade, but </strong><i><strong><u>will be based on your best 4 marks</u></strong></i><strong>. </strong></p><p> </p><p><u>2. </u><strong><u>AI Critical Evaluation Short Assignment (5% of final grade)</u></strong></p><p>A document with detailed instructions for completing this assignment can be found in the Content section of D2L, along with Examples. </p><p>1. <strong><u>KIN446:</u></strong> Using a general content generator (<i>e.g.</i> ChatGPT 3.5), you will be tasked with generating a one-paragraph document on a topic on a biochemical or physiological aspect of nutrition, health and disease, and then identifying 3 sentences that should be improved, and then describing how and why they should be improved. </p><p>2. <strong><u>KIN646:</u></strong> Graduate students will also generate a paragraph using an AI content generator, but will then be tasked with editing it using material from the scientific literature.</p><p><strong>Due on the last day of our KIN446/646 classes, Monday, March 31st at 11:59pm, on Dropbox</strong>. </p><p><strong><u>Late Submission Penalties for the AI Critical Evaluation Short Assignment</u>:</strong></p><p>A penalty of 1% of the graded item’s <i><strong><u>weighted value</u></strong></i> will be assigned, <i><strong><u>per day</u></strong></i>. </p><p>Specifically, submission of your <strong>AI Critical Evaluation Short Assignment</strong> worth 5% of your final mark anytime on Tuesday, April 1st (<i>i.e.</i> from 12:00 am to 11:59 pm) will result in a maximum grade of 4%, <i>instead of 5%</i>. Submission Wednesday, April 2nd (from 12:00 am to 11:59pm) will result in a maximum grade of 3% instead of 5%. Submission Thursday, April 3rd (from 12:00 am to 11:59pm) will result in a maximum grade of 2% instead of 5%. Submission Friday, April 4th (from 12:00 am to 11:59pm) will result in a maximum grade of 1% instead of 5%. Submission anytime after 12:00 am on Saturday, April 5th, or later, will result in a grade of 0%.</p>

You may experience stressors that can impact your personal well-being and academic experience, but there are multiple supports and resources available to you on and off-campus. </i></p><p><strong>Academic advisors</strong> – <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/health/current-undergraduates/advisors">https://uwaterloo.ca/health/current-undergraduates/advisors</a></p><p><strong>Association of Health Students Undergraduate Members (AHSUM)</strong> - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/association-health-students-undergraduate-members/">https://uwaterloo.a/association-health-students-undergraduate-members/</a></p><p><strong>Athletics and Recreation </strong>- <a href="http://warriors.uwaterloo.ca/">http://warriors.uwaterloo.ca/</a></p><p><strong>Campus Wellness - Counselling and Health Services </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</a></p><p><strong>Co-operative Education -</strong> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/">https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/</a></p><p><strong>Empower Me - Student Assistance Program</strong> – <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-supports/empower-me/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-supports/empower-me/</a></p><p><strong>Food Support Service </strong>– <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/food-support-service/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/food-support-service/</a></p><p><strong>Glow Centre for Sexual and Gender Diversity </strong>– <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/glow/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/glow/</a></p><p><strong>Good 2 Talk </strong>(free, confidential support services for post-secondary students in ON)<strong> </strong>–<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.good2talk.ca">www.good2talk.ca</a> or 1-866-925-5454</p><p><strong>Here 24 Seven </strong>(addictions, mental health &amp; crisis services Waterloo-Wellington)<strong> </strong>- <a href="http://www.here247.ca">www.here247.ca</a> or 1-844-HERE247 (1-844-437-3247)</p><p><strong>International Student Resources </strong>– <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/international-experience/international-student-resources">https://uwaterloo.ca/international-experience/international-student-resources</a></p><p><strong>Off Campus Community</strong> - <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/off-campus-community/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/off-campus-community/</a></p><p><strong>Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/</a></p><p><strong>Office of Indigenous Relations – Student Supports and Clubs - </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/student-resources/student-supports-and-clubs">https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/student-resources/student-supports-and-clubs</a></p><p><strong>Racial Advocacy for Inclusion, Solidarity and Equity (RAISE) </strong>- <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/raise/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/raise/</a></p><p><strong>Student Financial Services </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/student-financial-services">https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/student-financial-services</a></p><p><strong>Student Legal Protection Program </strong>– <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-supports/student-legal-protection-program/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-supports/student-legal-protection-program/</a></p><p> <strong>Student Success Office </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/">https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/</a></p><p><strong>UW Mates Peer Support</strong> – <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/mates/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/mates/</a></p><p><strong>Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) </strong>– <a href="https://wusa.ca/about/">https://wusa.ca/about/</a></p><p><strong>weCONNECTu Peer Mentorship Program (Faculty of Health) </strong>– <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/health/current-undergraduates/first-year/mentorship-program">https://uwaterloo.ca/health/current-undergraduates/first-year/mentorship-program</a></p><p><strong>Writing and Communication Centre </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/">https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Absences in Quest</strong></p><p><u>Religious or creed-related absence</u></p><p>Undergraduate students can now submit a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#religious">Religious Observance Self-Declaration</a> in Quest.

Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
