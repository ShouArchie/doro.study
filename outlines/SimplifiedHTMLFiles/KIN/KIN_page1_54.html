<p>Welcome to KIN 470: Kinesiology Seminar (Remote Measurement of Health in Neurologic Diseases)! My name is Beth Godkin and I’m looking forward to learning together. KIN 470 is a seminar course that encourages the application of knowledge and skills acquired in your 100-300 level courses and provides an opportunity to further develop skills related to knowledge acquisition and communication. In this section, students will develop skills including literature searching, appraisal and interpretation, verbal presentation and writing skills, and peer evaluation while focusing on topics related to remote health measurement in neurologic diseases.</p><p>Our learning will take place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishnaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>. For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory">CAUT Guide to Acknowledging First Peoples and Traditional Territory</a>.</p><p><strong>While I recognize our course syllabus is long, it is very important as it outlines our class norms and expectations—please read it thoroughly!</strong></p>

<p>All assessments will be submitted to LEARN. Presentation dates for each student will vary. However, all presentation files are due on the same day to help promote equity between students in the class, who may be presenting weeks apart. Below are the due dates, which are also included in the course schedule:</p><ul><li>Short Presentation File: Friday January 17th @ 11:59PM</li><li>Long Presentation File: Monday February 24th @ 12:00PM (noon)</li><li>1 Page Proposal (OPTIONAL): Friday March 21st @ 11:59PM</li><li>Research Report: Friday April 11th @ 11:59PM</li></ul><h3><strong>Short (Non-Specialist Audience) Presentation (15%)</strong></h3><p>Each student will choose a topic related to remote measurement of health in neurologic diseases to explain to a general audience (i.e., non-specialists, someone without a scientific background); each presentation must be on a different topic area that will be chosen by the <u>end of class on January 9</u><sup><u>th</u></sup>. The presenter will prepare a <u>5-minute presentation</u> on their topic using appropriate supporting materials such as PowerPoint (1-5 slides recommended) so that anyone can understand the topic. There will be a 5-minute interactive open feedback and discussion period following each presentation where fellow students will ask questions, provide positive and constructive comments, and share ideas for consideration on the presentation. </p><p><u>All presentation files are due on the same day: </u><strong>Friday January 17<sup>th</sup> @ 11:59 PM</strong>. Regardless of your presentation date, your presentation files (e.g., PowerPoint slides) must be completed and submitted by this deadline. Files will be uploaded to the LEARN Dropbox. This is to ensure equity between students in the class who may be presenting many weeks apart. </p><p>Four students will be selected to provide feedback for each presenter. You will not be required to submit evaluations on the dates of your own presentations. Remember that your comments on the evaluation form are very useful for the professional development of the presenter. You will be expected to include a remark outlining something done well and something that could be further developed. The peer evaluation will be submitted electronically (using Microsoft Forms) no later than 11:59pm on the evening of the presentation. Feedback can be completed using a laptop during the presentation. Alternatively, feedback forms can be completed on paper, but the student must upload their responses to Microsoft Forms by the deadline that same evening. Positive and constructive comments will be evaluated by the instructor and must accurately reflect the quality of the presentation. The peer evaluations (worth 5%) will be combined with the instructor’s comments (10%) and will be provided anonymously to the presenter.</p><h3><strong>Long (Scientific) Presentation (35%)</strong></h3><p>Each student will develop and prepare <u>a 15-minute presentation</u><strong> </strong>on their selected topic using appropriate support materials, such as PowerPoint. The topic of the presentation should be the same as the Short Presentation. If the student wishes to make an adjustment to their topic, they must discuss the change with the course instructor. The presentation should be based on scientific evidence, especially from primary peer reviewed research articles. Other website materials, anecdotal articles, lecture notes and opinions are allowed, but should be used to provide context for the scientific literature.</p><p>Like with the short presentation,<strong> </strong><u>all presentation files are due on the same day:</u><strong> Monday, February 24th @ 12:00PM (noon). </strong>Regardless of your presentation date, your presentation files must be completed and submitted by this deadline to ensure equity between students in the class who may be presenting many weeks apart. Files will be uploaded to the LEARN Dropbox.</p><p>The peer evaluation will be submitted electronically (using Microsoft Forms) no later than 11:59pm on the evening of the presentation. Feedback can be completed using a laptop during the presentation. Alternatively, feedback forms can be completed on paper, but the student must upload their responses to Microsoft Forms by the deadline that same evening. Positive and constructive comments will be evaluated by the instructor and must accurately reflect the quality of the seminar. The peer evaluations (10%) will be combined with the instructor’s comments (25%) and will be provided anonymously to the presenter.</p><h3><strong>Research Report (35%)</strong></h3><p>A written, scientific report is <strong>due on Friday April 11th @ 11:59PM</strong>. The report will be uploaded to the Dropbox on LEARN. Like the presentation, there should be enough background information so that the reader can understand the topic you selected and include a detailed literature review (minimum of 10 references) that supports how the problem has been identified and addressed thus far.</p><p>Overall, the paper must be at least 5 pages, but no more than 7 (double spaced; Font: Arial or Times New Roman; Margins: 1” all around; no condensed spacing). This does not include title page, figures, tables, and references. You are encouraged to use headings and sub-headings to appropriately structure and organize your report. </p><p>This report should not simply summarize the literature but should show that you’ve thought critically about the topic and interpreted the findings of the papers you’ve read.</p><p><u>Students are provided the opportunity to submit a one-page draft</u><strong> by Friday March 21st @ 11:59PM </strong>to receive constructive feedback prior to the full paper submission.<strong> </strong><u>Some things to keep in mind when considering this optional submission:</u></p><ul><li><strong>This early submission is optional and provided as an opportunity to receive written feedback to help guide the remainder of the written assignment.</strong></li><li>Submission can be crafted in a method of your choice. Some examples might include bulleted format (full topic sentences with supporting bullets), rough framework, or a single fully written page from your current draft. However, it must be only one page and adhere to the formatting guidelines (1” margins, 12-pt font size, double spaced). Anything beyond one page will not be reviewed.</li><li>Feedback will be provided within ten days of your submission. Feedback may include suggestions on high-level spelling/grammar/sentence structure, content/organization of arguments, clarity, and/or tone of your document.</li></ul><p>While this is not required, it is strongly encouraged as an opportunity to improve your writing skills prior to your final graded work.</p><h3><strong>Attendance &amp; Engagement (10%)</strong></h3><p><u>In-person attendance is required in KIN 470</u>. You will also be expected to actively engage during our classes (this looks like asking questions, offering ideas, active listening, participating in activities etc.). This may also include serving as a presentation chair/moderator to introduce peers during presentations. Your class attendance and engagement will be assessed throughout the term by the instructor. </p><h3><strong>Quality of Peer Evaluations (5%)</strong></h3><p>You will be required to submit peer evaluations for both the Short (Non-Specialist Audience) Presentation and the Long (Scientific) Presentation. For each presentation, you will be responsible for submitting feedback for ~4 different presenters. In turn, you will receive feedback from ~4 peers. An online Microsoft Form will be used to collect feedback. <u>The peer evaluation must be submitted no later than</u><strong> 11:59PM on the evening of the presentations you are assigned to evaluate</strong>. Feedback can then be shared with each student anonymously. The quality of your feedback will be assessed and contribute to 5% of your overall course grade.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3><strong>Course Communication Plan</strong></h3><p><i><strong>Student (Office) Hours: </strong></i>It’s important to know that Student Office Hours are dedicated time for you! You are welcome to drop in with any questions you have, whether that be course related or more broadly about university life. I have scheduled our time for Thursdays from 1-2pm, directly after our class in my office (BMH 1100A). My student office hours will be held weekly. If you need to connect outside of this time or want to discuss a more sensitive matter, please send me an email and we will make alternative arrangements together. </p><p><i><strong>Email: </strong></i>Feel free to email me if you have any questions throughout the course. I am here to help! Please include "KIN 470" in the subject line. I will do my best to respond within 48 hours during normal working hours (i.e., 8:30 AM – 4:30 PM Monday to Friday). However, please remember I am human! Sometimes I might be a little late or the email may get lost. If you don’t hear back within 4 working days, feel free to re-send your email with a friendly reminder. While I will do my best to answer your questions in a timely manner, please note that you should not expect to receive answers to emails on weekends, including the weekends before assignment due dates.</p><h3><strong>KIN 470 Assessment Guidelines</strong></h3><p><i><strong>Individual-authentic work:</strong> </i>All graded assignments in KIN 470 are expected to be individual, authentically created work. Therefore, no sharing, collaborating, copying, or using classmates’ work (or previous cohorts’ assignments) on your assignments will be tolerated. </p><p><i><strong>Generative AI tools: </strong></i>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as communicating effectively (written and verbal) via original material. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, <u>is NOT permitted in this class.</u> Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>In alignment with the University of Waterloo’s academic integrity office’s website on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/artificial-intelligence-and-chatgpt">Artificial intelligence and ChatGPT</a>, “A student who does not comply with the instructors rules about the use of [AI] tools will be subject to Policy 71 and an investigation into academic misconduct.” You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of your work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">Copyright Advisory Committee.</a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p><i><strong>Submitting files:</strong> </i>For written work, please submit assignments as Microsoft Word documents. For presentations, you are welcome to use and submit PowerPoint files. If you plan to use another technology, it is your responsibility to connect with me in advance to ensure I can open the file type on my computer. Your last submission to the LEARN Dropbox prior to the deadline will be graded. APA 7 will be used; proper referencing is expected for all graded submissions. Your last submission to the LEARN Dropbox prior to the deadline will be graded. Dropboxes within LEARN can lag when multiple submissions are occurring at the same time (which tends to happen when many submissions occur near the deadline). Therefore, if you submit your assignment at 11:53 pm but the assignment does not appear in the Dropbox until 12:03 am, then the assignment is subject to a late penalty. Avoid this by submitting well in advance! In addition to ensuring that your assignment is submitted as the correct file type and on time, it is also the student’s responsibility to submit the correct file to the Dropbox. Not all grading for this course happens at the same time and, therefore, the Dropbox may not be regularly monitored. To avoid incurring any late penalties for needing to re-submit after the deadline, but sure to carefully select the file you wish to submit. I would also encourage you to double check your submissions after uploading to LEARN. </p><p><i><strong>Late penalty:</strong> </i>On all assessments, including peer-reviews, a penalty of 10% per day will be applied to all late submissions without documentation or <i>prior </i>discussions with the instructor. If you have a concern about a deadline, please reach out to discuss. </p><p><i><strong>Reviewing feedback</strong></i><strong>: </strong>I am happy to go over your graded work and provide clarification when needed. However, students must wait 24 hours after feedback has been returned before contacting me; during this time, students are encouraged to review and reflect on the feedback received. After 24 hours, students have up to 1 week (7 days) to contact me to ask for further feedback or clarification.</p><h2><strong>ADDITIONAL POLICY INFO</strong></h2><p>In this section and the section below, there are important policies and information that you should familiarize yourself with before starting this course. I would really appreciate it if you could take the time to go through this section, to learn about some expected norms of our learning environment. </p><h3><strong>Wellness in KIN 470</strong></h3><p>You are a valued part of our community. We recognize that our individual identities shape our experiences in higher education. Some of us disproportionately encounter systemic barriers to belonging. University life can be difficult with multiple demands. The Faculty of Health is committed and actively working to foster an environment where you belong and can thrive. You may experience stressors that can impact your personal well-being and academic experience, but there are multiple supports and resources available to you on and off-campus.

Our lived experiences and who we are will be a starting point for our discussions. We will make sure that we respect our peers, even if their views and opinions are different from our own. We will learn to listen to others and to reflect on our own experiences. We will also be diligent in ensuring that our class is a safe space where everyone can feel welcome to share their opinion. We intend to not only benefit students themselves, but aid in becoming more empathetic, respectful and accommodating professionals/academics outside the class as well.</p><h3><strong>Academic Regulations and Accommodations</strong></h3><p>In addition to illness, there may be events that preclude students from meeting academic obligations. You can read more about <a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">academic regulations and accommodations here</a>. The following are examples of valid circumstances and required documentation that <strong>may </strong>warrant academic accommodation:</p><ul><li>A member of a varsity team travelling for competition: a letter/email from the Head Coach verifying the departure and return dates and times.</li><li>Death of a family member: a copy of the death certificate, a copy of the obituary or a link to the online obituary.</li><li>Travel: from time-to-time students are required to travel during an academic term for reasons NOT related to pleasure/vacation. If you are travelling and require accommodation, you must inform the instructor at least 2 weeks in advance of your travel, indicate the reason for travel and provide a boarding pass upon return to campus.</li></ul><p><strong>Important note:</strong> Travel that results in arrival to campus after the first day of class, absence before or after a reading break or departure from campus during the final exam period DO NOT warrant accommodation and any missed academic obligations will receive a grade of zero.</p><p><i><strong>A colleague's reflection I share</strong></i>: We will do our best to navigate challenges that arise this semester together. If you need to submit any absence form, <u>please email me within 24-48 hours of a deadline</u>. It is important that any students requiring academic accommodations based on religion, Indigenous, and spiritual observances know that these requests will be respected in our class. While the University of Waterloo uses the standard Canadian holiday schedule for class planning, in this class we will create a space where religious celebrations of all our students do not impede on their academic success. If you are celebrating any of the holidays <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/resources/religious-and-spiritual-days-observance-2025">listed here </a>(or others that may be missed), please feel free to reach out to me about accommodations.</p><p>In cases where you anticipate missed work in advance, please email me as soon as possible to facilitate arrangements. The overall golden rule: please communicate with me as early as you can!</p><h3><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong></h3><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website</a>. </p><h3><strong>Academic Integrity</strong></h3><p><i><strong>A colleague's reflection I share: </strong></i>In the University Policy section below, you will find reference to the Office of Academic Integrity's website, where you can find Waterloo policies related to academic integrity. In KIN 470, our classroom functions under the assumption of respect. I will respect your learning and work to provide you with an inclusive, fair, and fun classroom experience. In return, I expect you to try your best in the course and, importantly, create authentic work. If you ever feel such pressure that you feel your only option is to turn in work that isn’t your own, please come talk to me instead! Something that is your own, but maybe not your best, is always a better choice than submitting inauthentic work.</p><h3><strong>Important Dates: </strong></h3><ul><li>Classes begin: January 6, 2025</li><li>Reading week: February 15-23, 2025</li><li>Classes end: April 4, 2025</li><li>Final examinations begin: April 9, 2025</li><li>Final examinations end: April 25, 2025</li><li>Holiday(s), no class(es): February 17, 2025 and April 18, 2025</li></ul><h3><strong>Intellectual Property Copyright Violations</strong></h3><p>Academic integrity is a cornerstone of any educational institution. Students and faculty alike benefit when academic integrity is well understood, encouraged and maintained. The University and faculty strongly discourage students from participating in/uploading course materials on online sharing platforms, such as Course Hero, OneClass and similar platforms. In many cases, the material in question is created and owned by the faculty member or instructor. Faculty are indeed presumed to be the Intellectual Property Owners of the course materials. </p><p>Students are strongly advised to err on the side of caution and ask for permission from their instructors before sharing and/or distributing any course materials. These course materials will usually be made available only for personal use by students. Students may not distribute or reproduce the materials, whether for commercial purposes or not, without the express written consent of the faculty or instructor. Neither faculty nor the instructors waive their intellectual property rights when granting limited use of their course materials to students. </p><p>Uploading course materials, including lectures, quizzes, and exams, onto online sharing platforms such as Course Hero, OneClass, Facebook, Reddit, and similar platforms is considered to be a copyright violation, regardless of whether an individual did so intentionally or unintentionally. Ignorance of the law is not an excuse.</p><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as: </p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository). Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed written consent is considered a violation of intellectual property rights. Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h3><strong>Co-op Interviews</strong></h3><p>Academic obligations take priority over co-op interviews. Whenever possible students are encouraged to swap interview times to avoid conflicts with academic obligations. For details and procedures on what to do if you have an interview conflict, please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts">Interview Conflict</a> page on UW’s website.</p><p>If you are not able to resolve your interview conflict with a lab or tutorial, you may request to swap lab/tutorial sections for only the day/week in question. Please provide your instructor a screenshot from WaterlooWorks such that your name and the date and time of the scheduled interview are visible. If the interview was scheduled outside of WaterlooWorks, a letter/email from the prospective employer with the details outlined above will suffice. </p><p>If you're feeling overwhelmed with your interview schedule, you can contact your co-op advisor to discuss available options and/or fill out a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview#request-interview-relief">Request for Interview Relief Form</a> on WaterlooWorks. Depending on your situation, you may be able to choose to be removed from one or more of your upcoming interviews by having your job application(s) withdrawn.</p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.

<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
