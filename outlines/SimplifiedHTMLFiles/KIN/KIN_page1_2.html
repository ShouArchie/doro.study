<p><strong>In Class Questions (ICQs)</strong></p><p>Participating in the ICQ component requires you to purchase the Top Hat course materials and participate by being present in class.</p><p>ICQs will be used during lectures for the following purposes:</p><ul><li>As a way to practice the process of “retrieval practice”</li><li>To identify concepts that might need additional review by the instructor</li><li>To assess knowledge gained in “flipped classroom” activities</li><li>To encourage students to attend classes</li></ul><p>I will provide 3-5 questions per class. There are approximately 30 lectures in the term so this should provide you with more than 120 ICQs. Students will earn 1 mark for each response given and an additional 0.5 marks for correct responses. Therefor, each ICQ is worth 1.5 marks. </p><p>If you miss a class you will receive zero for that set of questions. It is not possible to submit ICQ responses using paper. </p><p><strong>Please note that responding on behalf of another student (i.e. bringing an extra device to class with you) is considered an academic offense and will be reported to the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies.</strong></p><p><strong>Midterm Exams:</strong></p><p>Midterms are <strong>closed book</strong>, no aids are allowed. More detail will be provided in class and on Learn. </p><p><strong>Final Exam:</strong></p><p>Final exams will be scheduled by the Registrar’s Office and will fall in the final exam period, which is from <strong>April 9th to 25th, 2025</strong>. The final exam is <strong>closed book</strong>, no aids are allowed. More detail will be provided in class and on Learn. </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
