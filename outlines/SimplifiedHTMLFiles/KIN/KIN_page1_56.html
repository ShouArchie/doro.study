<p>All assessments will be submitted to LEARN. Presentation dates for each student will vary. However, all presentation files are due on the same day to help promote equity between students in the class, who may be presenting weeks apart. Below are the due dates, which are also included in the course schedule:</p><ul><li>Short Presentation File: Friday January 17th @ 11:59pm</li><li>Long Presentation File: Monday February 24 @ 12:00pm (*note that this is noon-hour)</li><li>Research Report: Friday April 11th @ 11:59pm</li></ul><h3><strong>SHORT (NON-SPECIALIST AUDIENCE) PRESENTATION (15%)</strong></h3><p>Each student will choose a topic related to kinesiology and the workplace to explain to a general audience (i.e., non-specialists, someone without a scientific background); each presentation must be on a different topic area that will be chosen by the <strong>end of class on January 9th</strong>. The presenter will prepare a <strong>5-minute presentation</strong> on their topic using appropriate supporting materials such as PowerPoint (1-5 slides recommended) so that anyone can understand the topic. There will be a 5-minute interactive open feedback and discussion period following each presentation where fellow students will ask questions, provide positive and constructive comments, and share ideas for consideration on the presentation. The presentation should achieve the following:</p><ol><li>Be formatted for a non-specialist or lay audience.</li><li>Introduce your topic and state your research objective/question.</li><li>Outline the importance and relevance of your selected topic. You must do this within a societal context, but you may also take some time to explain why it is important to you specifically.</li><li>Provide at least three scientific articles and identify a main finding from each that is relevant to your topic.</li></ol><p><strong>All presentation files are due on the same day: Friday, January 17th @ 11:59 PM</strong>. Regardless of your presentation date, your presentation files (e.g., PowerPoint slides) must be completed and submitted by this deadline. Files will be uploaded to the LEARN Dropbox. This is to ensure equity between students in the class who may be presenting many weeks apart. </p><p>Four students will be selected to provide feedback for each presenter. You will not be required to submit evaluations on the dates of your own presentations. Remember that your comments on the evaluation form are very useful for the professional development of the presenter. You will be expected to include a remark outlining something done well and something that could be further developed. The peer evaluation will be submitted electronically (using Microsoft Forms) no later than 11:59pm on the evening of the presentation. Feedback can be completed using a laptop during the presentation. Alternatively, feedback forms can be completed on paper, but the student must upload their responses to Forms by the deadline that same evening. Positive and constructive comments will be evaluated by the instructor and must accurately reflect the quality of the presentation. The peer evaluations (worth 5%) will be combined with the instructor’s comments (10%) and will be provided anonymously to the presenter.</p><h3><strong>LONG (SCIENTIFIC) PRESENTATION (35%)</strong></h3><p>Each student will develop and prepare <strong>a 15-minute presentation </strong>on their selected topic using appropriate support materials, such as PowerPoint. The topic of the presentation should be the same as the Short Presentation. If the student wishes to make an adjustment to their topic, they must discuss the change with the course instructor. The presentation should be based on scientific evidence especially from primary peer reviewed research articles. Other website materials, anecdotal articles, lecture notes and opinions are allowed, but should be used to provide context for the scientific literature. The presentation should achieve the following: </p><ol><li>Be formatted for a scientific audience.</li><li>Introduce your research objective/question and outline its importance with relevant background information.</li><li>Critically evaluate primarily scientific and peer-reviewed articles. This should include identifying main findings from relevant papers and outlining the article strengths and weaknesses. Multiple papers with different perspectives and approaches should be considered.</li><li>Synthesize the literature to identify patterns and discrepancies among the evidence.</li><li>Provide a cohesive summary and conclusion, focusing on the take home messages of your work, and identify potential gaps and areas for future research.</li></ol><p><strong>Like the short presentation, all presentation files are due on the same day: Monday February 24 @ 12:00pm (*note that this is noon-hour). </strong>Regardless of your presentation date, your presentation files must be completed and submitted by this deadline to ensure equity between students in the class who may be presenting many weeks apart. Files will be uploaded to the LEARN Dropbox.</p><p>Four students will be selected to provide feedback for each presenter. You will not be required to submit evaluations on the dates of your own presentations. <strong>The peer evaluation will be submitted electronically (using Microsoft Forms) no later than 11:59pm on the evening of the presentation. </strong>Feedback can be completed using a laptop during the presentation. Alternatively, feedback forms can be completed on paper, but the student must upload their responses to Forms by the deadline that same evening. Positive and constructive comments will be evaluated by the instructor and must accurately reflect the quality of the seminar. The peer evaluations (10%) will be combined with the instructor’s comments (25%) and will be provided anonymously to the presenter.</p><h3><strong>RESEARCH REPORT (35%)</strong></h3><p>A written, scientific report is <strong>due on Friday April 11th @ 11:59pm</strong>. The report will be uploaded to the Dropbox on LEARN. Like the presentation, there should be enough background information so that the reader can understand the topic you selected and include a detailed literature review (minimum of 10 references) that supports how the problem has been identified and addressed thus far.</p><p>Overall, the paper must be at least 5 pages, but no more than 7 (double spaced; Font: Arial or Times New Roman; Margins: 1” all around; no condensed spacing). This does not include title page, figures, tables, and references.</p><p>This report should not simply summarize the literature but should show that you’ve thought critically about the topic and interpreted the findings of the papers you’ve read. Your paper should achieve the following:</p><ol><li>Introduce your topic, state your research objective/question, and outline its importance with relevant background information.</li><li>Critically evaluate primarily scientific and peer-reviewed articles. Discuss strengths and weaknesses of the literature, within the context of your topic.</li><li>Synthesize the literature and discuss your main findings.</li><li>Identify potential gaps and areas for future research.</li><li>Provide a cohesive summary and conclusion, focusing on the take home messages of your work.</li></ol><p>During class on March 25 and 27 we will peer review 1-page outlines for our reports. Outlines can be crafted in a method of your choice. Some examples might include bulleted format (full topic sentences with supporting bullets), rough framework, or a single fully written page from your current draft. However, it must be only one page and adhere to the formatting guidelines (1” margins, 12-pt font size, double spaced). Anything beyond one page will not be reviewed.</p><h3><strong>ATTENDANCE &amp; ENGAGEMENT (10%)</strong></h3><p><strong>In-person attendance is required in KIN 470</strong>. You will also be expected to actively engage during our classes (this looks like asking questions, offering ideas, active listening, participating in activities etc.).  Your class attendance and engagement will be assessed throughout the term by the instructor. </p><h3><strong>QUALITY OF PEER EVALUATIONS  (5%)</strong></h3><p>You will be required to submit peer evaluations for both the Short (Non-Specialist Audience) Presentation and the Long (Scientific) Presentation. For each presentation, you will be responsible for submitting feedback for 4 different presenters. In turn, you will receive feedback from 4 peers. An online Microsoft Form will be used to collect feedback. <strong>The peer evaluation must be submitted no later than 11:59pm on the evening of the presentations you are assigned to evaluate</strong>. Feedback can then be shared with each student anonymously. The quality of your feedback will be assessed and contribute to 5% of your overall course grade.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>OTHER KIN 470 ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES</strong></h3><p><i><strong>Individual-authentic work:</strong> </i>All graded assignments in KIN 470 are expected to be individual, authentically created work. Therefore, no sharing, collaborating, copying, or using classmates’ work (or previous cohorts’ assignments) on your assignments will be tolerated. </p><p><i><strong>Generative AI tools: </strong></i>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as communicating effectively (written and verbal) via original material. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, <u>is NOT permitted in this class.</u> Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>In alignment with the University of Waterloo’s academic integrity office’s website on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/artificial-intelligence-and-chatgpt">Artificial intelligence and ChatGPT</a>, “A student who does not comply with the instructors rules about the use of [AI] tools will be subject to Policy 71 and an investigation into academic misconduct.” You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">Copyright Advisory Committee.</a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p><i><strong>Submitting files:</strong> </i>For written work, please submit assignments as Microsoft Word documents. For presentations, you are welcome to use and submit PowerPoint files. If you plan to use another technology, it is your responsibility to connect with me in advance to ensure I can open the file type on my computer. Your last submission to the LEARN Dropbox prior to the deadline will be graded. APA 7 will be used; proper referencing is expected for all graded submissions.</p><p><i><strong>Late penalty:</strong> </i>On all assessments, including peer-reviews, a penalty of 10% per day will be applied to all late submissions without documentation or <i>prior </i>discussions with the instructor. If you have a concern about a deadline, please reach out to discuss. </p><p><i><strong>Reviewing feedback</strong></i><strong>: </strong>I am happy to go over your graded work and provide clarification when needed. However, students must wait 24 hours after feedback has been returned before contacting me; during this time, students are encouraged to review and reflect on the feedback received. After 24 hours, students have up to 1 week (7 days) to contact me to ask for further feedback or clarification.</p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
