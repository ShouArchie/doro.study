<p>Welcome to KIN 471: Health Psychology! My name is Dr. Michelle Ogrodnik and I’m looking forward to learning together. In this course, students will evaluate relationships between psychological, biological, and societal factors that impact health and illness. Students will critique multiple perspectives (from peer reviewed concepts to personal reflections) and apply their knowledge to different health outcomes such as (but not limited to) physical inactivity, depression, anxiety, chronic stress, and addiction. As part of the learning process, students will also develop their communication and collaboration skills. After taking this course, students will be better equipped to critically assess the impact of the world around them on health and illness using a comprehensive, integrative lens. </p><p>Our learning will take place on the traditional territory of‎ the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. As part of the UW community, I encourage you to engage with the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/engagement-knowledge-building/resources-allyship">resources and allyship information</a> provided by the Office of Indigenous Relations, as a starting point.</p><p><strong>While I recognize this document (our course syllabus) is long, it is very important as it outlines our class norms and expectations—please read it thoroughly!</strong></p>

<h2>
  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Evaluate relationships between psychological, biological, and societal factors that impact health and illness for individuals and communities. </td>
</tr>
<tr>

  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>KIN 471: Health Psychology is an in-person seminar style class that <strong>will not regularly be recorded.</strong> However, in the event of unforeseen circumstances, activities for this course may involve recording, in partial fulfillment of the course learning outcomes.  </p><p>You will receive notification of recording via at least one of the following mechanisms: within the Learning Management System (LEARN), a message from your course instructor, course syllabus/website, or other means. Some technologies may also provide a recording indicator. Images, audio, text/chat messaging that have been recorded may be used and/or made available by the University to Michelle Ogrodnik for purposes including  material review and assessment. Recordings will be managed according to the University records classification scheme, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/records-management/records-classification-and-retention-schedules"><u>WatClass</u></a>, and will be securely destroyed when no longer needed by the University. Your personal information is protected in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31"><u>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</u></a>, as well as <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/privacy/"><u>University policies and guidelines</u></a> and may be subject to disclosure where required by law.</p><p>The University will use reasonable means to protect the security and confidentiality of the recorded information, but cannot provide a guarantee of such due to factors beyond the University’s control, such as recordings being forwarded, copied, intercepted, circulated, disclosed, or stored without the University’s knowledge or permission or the introduction of malware into computer system which could potentially damage or disrupt the computer, networks, and security settings. The University is not responsible for connectivity/technical difficulties or loss of data associated with your hardware, software or Internet connection.</p><p>By engaging in course activities that involve recording, you are consenting to the use of your appearance, image, text/chat messaging, and voice and/or likeness in the manner and under the conditions specified herein. (In the case of a live stream event, if you choose not to have your image or audio recorded, you may <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-it-services/"><u>disable the audio and video functionality</u></a>. Instructions to participate using a pseudonym instead of your real name are included where the feature exists; however, you must disclose the pseudonym to your instructor in advance in order to facilitate class participation.) If you choose not to be recorded, this notice serves as confirmation of your understanding that you should reach out to the instructor to discuss alternative options.   </p><p>You are not permitted to disclose the link to/URL of an event or an event session recording or copies of recording to anyone, for any reason. Recordings are available only to authorized individuals who have been directly provided the above instructions/link for their use. Recordings for personal use, required to facilitate your learning and preparation of personal course/lecture notes, should not be shared with others without the permission of the instructor or event coordinator. Review the University’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>guidelines for faculty, staff and students entering relationships with external organizations offering access to course materials</u></a> for more information on your obligations with respect to keeping copies of course materials.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Course Communication Plan</h3><p><i><strong>Student (Office) Hours: </strong></i>It’s important to know that Student Hours (what I call Office Hours) are dedicated time for you! You are welcome to drop in with any questions you have, whether that be course related or more broadly about university life. I have scheduled our time for Mondays from 1:30-2:20 PM and Wednesdays from 10:30-11:20 AM. My student hours will be held weekly. If you need to connect outside of this time or want to discuss a more sensitive matter, please send me an email and we will make alternative arrangements together. </p><p><i><strong>Email: </strong></i>Feel free to email the TA or myself if you have any questions throughout the course. We are here to help! When emailing either myself or the TA, please include KIN 471 in the subject line. We will do our best to respond within 48 hours during normal working hours (i.e., 8:30 AM – 4:30 PM Monday to Friday). However, please remember we are humans and have many students from across multiple courses reaching out! Sometimes we might be a little late or the email may get lost. If you don’t hear back within 3 working days, feel free to re-send your email with a friendly reminder. While we will do our best to answer your questions in a timely manner, please note that you should not expect to receive answers to emails during evenings or weekends, including before quiz and assignment due dates.</p><h3>Course Attendance</h3><p>Regular attendance is vital for effective group work, as each member's contributions are essential to project success. Consistent presence fosters strong team dynamics and ensures equitable distribution of tasks. It also allows for active participation in class discussions and collaborative learning activities, enriching both your understanding of the material and that of your peers. If you anticipate any absences, please notify the instructor (and your group members if it is a working period) in advance to facilitate adjustments and minimize any disruption to group progress. Your commitment to attending class and actively engaging with your group will greatly contribute to the overall success of our collaborative projects, class environment, and your course engagement score. </p><h3>KIN 471 Assessment Guidelines</h3><p><i><strong>Generative AI tools: </strong></i>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. However, you should always be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of your work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted OR if not attributed appropriately, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai">through the Library.</a> Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">Copyright Advisory Committee.</a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI.</p><p><i><strong>Submitting files: </strong></i>For written work, please submit assignments as Microsoft Word documents. For presentations, you are welcome to use and submit PowerPoint files. If you plan to use another technology for any project, it is your responsibility to connect with me in advance to ensure I can open the file type on my computer. APA 7 will be used and proper referencing is expected for all graded submissions. Your last submission to the LEARN Dropbox prior to the deadline will be graded. Anything uploaded after 11:59PM will be considered late, and a penalty applied - avoid this by submitting well in advance! In addition to ensuring that your assignment is submitted as the correct file type and on time, it is also the student’s responsibility to submit the correct file to the dropbox. Not all grading for this course happens at the same time and, therefore, the dropbox may not be regularly monitored. To avoid incurring any late penalties for needing to re-submit after the deadline, but sure to carefully select the file you wish to submit. I would also encourage you to double check your submissions after uploading to LEARN. </p><p><i><strong>Late penalty: </strong></i>On all assessments, including group-based assignments, a penalty of 10% per day will be applied to all late submissions without documentation or prior discussions with the instructor. If you have a concern about a deadline, please reach out to discuss. </p><p><i><strong>Reviewing feedback</strong></i><strong>:</strong> We are happy to go over your graded work and provide clarification when needed. However, students must wait 24 hours after feedback has been returned before contacting the instructional team; during this time, students are encouraged to review and reflect on the feedback received. After 24 hours, students have up to 1 week (7 days) to contact me and/or the TA (depending on the original grader) to ask for further feedback or clarification. You will be expected to provide specific questions, details, and justification if inquiring about a grade change (e.g., Page 3, lines 7 to 12, or Slides 3-5 &amp; why you think you have earned more marks, based on the associated rubric). While we are happy to review grading with students, please note that the instructor has the final authority in determining the grade.</p><h2>Additional Policy Info</h2><p>In this section and the section below, there are important policies and information that you should familiarize yourself with before starting this course. I would really appreciate it if you could take the time to go through this section, to learn about some expected norms of our learning environment. For some of the University of Waterloo’s policies listed below, I’ve also included a few sentences on “<i><strong>Dr. O's reflection</strong></i>” with more course specific details. </p><h3>Wellness in KIN 471</h3><p>You are a valued part of our community.

We will learn to listen to others and to reflect on our own experiences. We will also be diligent in ensuring that our class is a safe space where everyone can feel welcome to share their opinion. We intend to not only benefit students themselves, but aid in becoming more empathetic, respectful and accommodating professionals/academics outside the class as well.</p><h3>Academic Regulations and Accommodations</h3><p>In addition to illness, there may be events that preclude students from meeting academic obligations.

The following are examples of valid circumstances and required documentation that may<strong> </strong>warrant academic accommodation:</p><ul><li>A member of a varsity team travelling for competition: a letter/email from the Head Coach verifying the departure and return dates and times.</li><li>Death of a family member: a copy of the death certificate, a copy of the obituary or a link to the online obituary.</li><li>Travel: from time-to-time students are required to travel during an academic term for reasons NOT related to pleasure/vacation. If you are travelling and require accommodation, you must inform the instructor at least 2 weeks in advance of your travel, indicate the reason for travel and provide a boarding pass upon return to campus.</li></ul><p><strong>Important note:</strong> Travel that results in arrival to campus after the first day of class, absence before or after a reading break or departure from campus during the final exam period DO NOT warrant accommodation and any missed academic obligations will receive a grade of zero.</p><p><i><strong>Dr. O's reflection</strong></i>: We will do our best to navigate challenges that arise this semester together. If you need to submit any absence form, please email me as soon as possible (at least within 24-48 hours after submitting your absence request form). <strong>However, please note that one student submitting an absence form or extension request will not excuse the group from submitting their work as per the original deadline. </strong></p><p>It is important that any students requiring academic accommodations based on religion, Indigenous, and spiritual observances know that these requests will be respected in our class. While the University of Waterloo uses the standard Canadian holiday schedule for class planning, in this class we will create a space where religious celebrations of all our students do not impede on their academic success. If you are celebrating any of the holidays <a href="https://diversity.missouristate.edu/Observances.htm#2023">listed here </a>(or others that may be missed), please feel free to reach out to Dr. O about accommodations.</p><p>In cases where you anticipate missed work in advance, please email me as soon as possible to facilitate arrangements - this is especially important in this class, given the many collaborative elements. The overall golden rule: please communicate with me as early as you can!</p><h3>Note for Students with Disabilities or Those Seeking Accommodations for Racial Trauma</h3><p><i><strong>Dr. O's reflection: </strong></i>In the University Policy section below you will find reference to AccessAbilities Services. Alongside connecting with AccessAbility Services, I am always open to suggestions or conversations around how to make our learning space more accessible and would welcome a meeting or email. It is important to also note that AccessAbility services isn't just for folks with disabilities. For example, in addition to providing academic accommodations for students with disabilities, AccessAbility Services also offers accommodations for students experiencing the physical, emotional, and psychological effects of racism and racial trauma. More information on how to utilize this resource can be found at<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/resources/accommodations-racial-trauma"> this link. </a></p><h3>Academic Integrity </h3><p><i><strong>Dr. O's reflection: </strong></i>In the University Policy section below you will find reference to the Office of Academic Integrity's website, where you can find Waterloo policies related to academic integrity. In KIN 471, our classroom functions under the assumption of respect. I will respect your learning and work to provide you with an inclusive, fair, and fun classroom experience. In return, I expect you to try your best in the course and, importantly, create authentic work. If you ever feel such pressure that you feel your only option is to turn in work that isn’t your own, please come talk to me instead! Something that is your own, but maybe not your best, is always a better choice than submitting inauthentic work. </p><h3>Important Dates: </h3><ul><li>Classes begin January 6, 2025</li><li>Add period ends January 17, 2025</li><li>Last day to drop a class from the academic record (100% tuition &amp; fee refund deadline) January 24, 2025</li><li>Reading week February 15 to February 23, 2025</li><li>50% tuition &amp; fee refund deadline February 14, 2025</li><li>Classes end April 4, 2025</li><li>On-campus exams begin April 9, 2025</li><li>On-campus exams end April 25, 2025</li></ul><h3>Intellectual Property Copyright Violations</h3><p>Academic integrity is a cornerstone of any educational institution. Students and faculty alike benefit when academic integrity is well understood, encouraged and maintained. The University and faculty strongly discourage students from participating in/uploading course materials on online sharing platforms, such as Course Hero, OneClass and similar platforms. In many cases, the material in question is created and owned by the faculty member or instructor. Faculty are indeed presumed to be the Intellectual Property Owners of the course materials. </p><p>Students are strongly advised to err on the side of caution and ask for permission from their instructors before sharing and/or distributing any course materials. These course materials will usually be made available only for personal use by students. Students may not distribute or reproduce the materials, whether for commercial purposes or not, without the express written consent of the faculty or instructor. Neither faculty nor the instructors waive their intellectual property rights when granting limited use of their course materials to students. </p><p>Uploading course materials, including lectures, quizzes, and exams, onto online sharing platforms such as Course Hero, OneClass, Facebook, Reddit, and similar platforms is considered to be a copyright violation, regardless of whether an individual did so intentionally or unintentionally. Ignorance of the law is not an excuse.</p><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as: </p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository). <strong>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed written consent is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</strong> Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h3>Co-op Interviews</h3><p>Academic obligations take priority over co-op interviews. Whenever possible students are encouraged to swap interview times to avoid conflicts with academic obligations. For details and procedures on what to do if you have an interview conflict, please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts">Interview Conflict</a> page on UW’s website.</p><p>If you are not able to resolve your interview conflict with a lab or tutorial, you may request to swap lab/tutorial sections for only the day/week in question. Please provide your instructor a screenshot from WaterlooWorks such that your name and the date and time of the scheduled interview are visible. If the interview was scheduled outside of WaterlooWorks, a letter/email from the prospective employer with the details outlined above will suffice. </p><p>If you're feeling overwhelmed with your interview schedule, you can contact your co-op advisor to discuss available options and/or fill out a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview#request-interview-relief">Request for Interview Relief Form</a> on WaterlooWorks. Depending on your situation, you may be able to choose to be removed from one or more of your upcoming interviews by having your job application(s) withdrawn.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
