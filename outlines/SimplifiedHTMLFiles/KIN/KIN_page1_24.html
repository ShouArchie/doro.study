  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>KIN 320:</div>
<p>Task analysis describes methodologies that can be applied to identify, describe, and analyze how people interact with their environment and with each other. Task analysis includes a broad range of descriptive and analytic techniques from which the practitioner must select the most appropriate one for their purposes and setting. This skills-based course will guide students in learning task analysis methodologies and associated techniques using a combination of didactic, case-study, and experiential learning-based teaching methods. The application of task analysis from the perspective of a Human Factors &amp; Ergonomics (HFE) specialist will be emphasized.</p>

<p>The midterm tests are organized by topics and while not strictly cumulative, are at least partially dependent on preceding course material. The Take Home Task Analysis term test is cumulative. Instructions regarding time allotted and submission methods will be provided in conjunction with these evaluations. The course instructor may adjust student grades at their discretion up until final grades are submitted. Students will be informed of any grade changes in writing.</p><p><strong>Missed midterms will be transferred to either the next midterm or the take home term test. </strong></p><p><strong>There will be no extensions, and late material will be penalized one full grade (10%) per day.</strong></p><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) may be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Late Policy</strong></p><p>A penalty of 1% per hour late will be applied up to a maximum of 48 hours. After 48 hours a grade of 0 will be applied.</p><p><strong>Self-declaration of short-term absence</strong></p><p>The Registrar's Office is piloting a short-term accommodation process. Students may experience short-term absences for several reasons for which they cannot participate or complete their academic responsibilities. For any assessments during the <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-The-Formal-Lecture-Period">formal lecture period</a>, students may self-declare their short-term absence within Quest using the Self-Declaration of Absence Form. Students will be permitted to self-declare short-term absence <strong>once</strong> per academic term, during the formal lecture period. A self-declared short-term absence will excuse students for up to 48 hours. <strong>The timing of which does not start when you submit your form</strong>. For example, if you declare a Tuesday as your first day absent, the Wednesday would be your second day and you would be expected to return to your studies on the Thursday (two full days absent; Tuesday and Wednesday). <strong>You are permitted to attend lectures, labs, tutorials, etc. However, you are not permitted to submit any assignments/assessments</strong>. For more information please visit the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences">self-declaration of short-term absence website</a>.</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
