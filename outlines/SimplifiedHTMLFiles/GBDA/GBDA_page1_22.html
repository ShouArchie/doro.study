  Instructor &amp; TA (Teaching Assistant) Information
</h2>
<div>
<h2><strong>Your Instructor: Carolyn Eckert, PhD, C (she/her) </strong></h2><p>I am a PhD Candidate in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/english/">Department of English Language and Literature</a>. My research is situated in the Rhetoric of Science, Technology, and Medicine (RSTM). With more than 20 years of experience in communications, public relations, and marketing, I bring professional expertise and academic insight to my research and teaching. My current research (dissertation) focuses on pandemic communication, exploring who produces news content, the persuasive strategies used, and how these influence public compliance or resistance. By examining Canada’s history of epidemics and pandemics, I analyze the rhetorical and figural language shaping responses to crises like COVID-19. </p><p>My teaching experience includes course and curriculum design/development and teaching part-time communications and marketing at Conestoga College and Humber College.  </p><ul><li><i>In your emails and communications, please call me Prof or Carolyn</i>. My pronouns are she/her</li><li>email: ceckert@uwaterloo.ca</li><li>Meeting times with Instructor:  I am available via Teams, by email or before and after class.</li></ul><h2><strong>Your TAs: </strong></h2><p><strong>Jin Sol Kim (she/her) </strong>PhD, ABD is in the Department of English Language and Literature. Her dissertation focuses on digital media, visual culture, and postcolonial/ critical race theory to consider how digital photography shapes and negotiates racial identities and ideologies. Her other research interests include ethics in technology and design: over the last few years, she has worked on topics including ethics in engineering education and facial recognition bias. Jin Sol holds a BA in English Literature and Rhetoric, Minor Speech Communication, and an MA in Rhetoric and Communication Design from the University of Waterloo. You can reach Jin Sol at: <a href="mailto:js2kim@uwaterloo.ca"><u>js2kim@uwaterloo.ca</u></a></p><p><strong>Areeba Akhtar (she/her)</strong> is a Master of Architecture student at the University of Waterloo, with a bachelor's degree in architecture. Her undergraduate thesis, <i>"Repository of the Elusive: Conserving Olfactory Traditions of Kannauj,"</i> focused on preserving intangible cultural heritage through innovative design. Her academic background includes coursework on values, ethics, problem-solving, and creative thinking, which developed her ability to approach design challenges with critical and ethical perspectives. In her graduate research, <i>"Resilient and Adaptive Futures: Integrating Design for Deconstruction with Disaster Management Strategies,"</i> she investigates sustainable design solutions that align closely with the ethical considerations of GBDA 306. Areeba’s work emphasizes integrating stakeholder values, sustainability, and equity into design processes, reflecting the course's focus on ethical responsibilities in design and globalization.

<h2><strong>Assessment</strong></h2><p><strong>What Does My Grade Mean?</strong></p><p><i>A+ (90–100):</i> This mark is for exceptional work that demonstrates a profound understanding of the issues presented in class. It indicates work that is well above average for GBDA students. The work demonstrates a professional level of involvement and execution on the part of the student, and stands on its own terms outside of the context of a school assignment.</p><p>A (80-89): This mark is for exceptional work that, to varying degrees, demonstrates a thorough understanding of the issues presented in class. It indicates work that is above average for GBDA students. The work demonstrates a deep involvement on the part of the student, and could stand on its own terms outside of the context of a school assignment.</p><p><i>B (70-79)</i>: This mark is for notable work that, to varying degrees, shows that the student has understood the topic and has made every effort to fulfill the requirements of the assignment to the best of their ability. It indicates work of the expected quality for GBDA students, and represents good work.</p><p><i>C (60-69)</i>: This mark is for satisfactory/acceptable work, to varying degrees: for example, it may be successful on one level, but fails on another. Alternately, the work may reflect a good deal of effort, but it does not adequately address the topic at hand. It is not quite up to GBDA standards, but not that far away, either. After having followed recommendations by the instructor, future work is likely to meet GBDA standards.</p><p><i>D (50-59)</i>: This mark is for barely adequate work, to varying degrees: the work displays minimal effort and commitment on the part of the student and/or does not convey a sufficient understanding of the topic at hand. It is below GBDA standards, and significantly more effort would be required to meet those standards.</p><p><i>F (33-49):</i> This mark is for insufficient or incomplete work, to varying degrees, and is marked as a fail. It indicates work that is well below GBDA standards, and future work would require substantial effort to meet standards.</p><h2><strong>A Note on Expectations</strong></h2><p>This course will have more academic content than a studio or skills acquisition course. This means that you will be expected to read, think, synthesize, and apply ideas rather than memorize information. Most of all, you will be expected to communicate through your writing clearly and effectively. Grades of 85%+ are reserved for students who exceed expectations for deliverables, not for merely meeting expectations. Success will also require that you undertake efforts to show more than basic familiarity with course content but that you can elaborate, synthesize, and expand upon course material in your written work. Grades of 85%+ are reserved for students who consistently exceed expectations for deliverables, not for merely meeting expectations.</p><h2><strong>Attendance and Participation Policy</strong></h2><ul><li>There are no exams or major term tests in this course.  Successful completion of the course relies on consistent weekly participation, both in terms of in-class contributions as well as online contributions.</li><li><strong>Hybrid</strong>. This is a hybrid in-person course, meaning that BOTH in-class and online contributions are core components of the course.  Along with completing your assigned readings and assignments each week, you are expected attend class in-person each week (2 hours) and allocate an additional hour for weekly online contributions.</li><li><strong>Workload.</strong>  Please note that you are expected to do approximately 25 pages per week of readings.  Plan for this to take <i>at least </i>3 hours/week, plus the additional time you will need to spend completing your assignments. <u>The total time commitment for this course should be approximately 8 hours per week</u>.</li><li><strong>Attendance.</strong> You are responsible for knowing the material and announcements presented during seminars whether or not you attend class. Please arrange with another student to get missed notes and announcements. An excellent way to get in touch with fellow students is on LEARN.</li><li><strong>An Important Note About Chronic Absenteeism. </strong>Because a large part of this course is dependent on in-class activities and fostering a collaborative learning community, in the case of students absent for more than 4 classes, the instructor reserves the right to assign final grades that are proportionate to their contributions to our class, which is measured by completion of the weekly in-class activities.</li></ul><h2><strong>Announcements </strong></h2><p>The Instructor will use the <strong>Announcements</strong> widget on the Course Home page during the term to communicate new or changing information regarding due dates, any instructor absences, etc., as needed. You are expected to read the announcements on a regular basis. To ensure you are viewing the complete list of announcements, you may need to click Show All Announcements.</p><h2><strong>Plagiarism &amp; Copyright Policy</strong></h2><p>The offence of plagiarism as defined by Policy 71 (Student Discipline) includes visual and aural plagiarism of creative work (drawings, photographs, graphics, video, sound, graphics, or creative ideas conceived of, or made by others). The rules of conduct that apply to text-based work at the University of Waterloo also apply to work completed for creative assignments and research. There are two issues to consider with visual and aural plagiarism: ethics, i.e. expectations related to academic integrity as outlined in Policy 71; and copyright infringement, for which you could also be legally liable. Plagiarism and copyright infringement occurs when you produce creative material that is substantially similar to the original source. Please take note of the following points:</p><ul><li>All work submitted for evaluation must be your own. If the submitted work is determined not to be your own, has been created by another on your behalf, or has been created for another context (i.e. another course, client work, etc.), the Academic Discipline Procedure of Policy 71 will be invoked.</li><li>Design templates, software plug-ins, sample code, stock images, and other generative software may only be used with the expressed permission of the instructor.  Any material that is not yours must be cited in your code and at the bottom of your Project statement.</li><li>Any original material used as the basis for any work you create – whether manipulated digitally or manually, or otherwise incorporated or appropriated for your work as part of a conceptual idea – must be cited in your code and at the bottom of your Project statement.</li><li>Resources that are available in the public domain are identified as copyright free or that fall under licenses from Creative Commons. Public domain is a term used for works that are not protected by copyright law. Works identified as Creative Commons allow varying degrees of use. In this case, the authors decide how you can use their content. For more information, see the guidelines on <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">creativecommons.org</a>.</li></ul><h2><strong>How to Hand in Assignments</strong></h2><ul><li>All assignments must be submitted electronically via LEARN.  Unless otherwise specified, <strong>they are due as per the Course Schedule.</strong></li><li>Keep an electronic and paper copy of any assignments you submit. Be sure to back up your work (both locally and to network/cloud drives) as you write.</li><li>Ensure you are submitting the correct files to the correct LEARN dropbox.  After uploading, please double check that you have submitted the correct file and version, as <strong>what is submitted to the LEARN dropbox is what is graded</strong>.</li><li>Any formal written submissions should employ proper APA format. This should include a cover sheet that indicates your name, student number, title, instructor's name, course number, and word count. Word count should <strong>not</strong> include your references. Papers should have page numbering, one inch margins, be double spaced, and use 12 point, Times New Roman (default) font.</li><li>Make sure your bibliography on submitted work is perfect, including citing any images, sound clips, or visual elements incorporated in your work. If you are unfamiliar with APA citation style you should consult one of the many books in the library that will provide guidance on academic styles. Perdue also has online guides found here: <a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/">http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Late Policies &amp; Extension Requests</strong></h2><ul><li>All assignments are due on the dates indicated in the syllabus. To reduce the number of extension requests, as well as student anxiety, excepting in-class activities which are due the day of class, <strong>assignments will not be subject to late penalties, unless they are more than 5 days past the due date</strong>. After that, they will be docked up to 10% per day.  For example, an assignment due Wednesday, January 18 at 11:59pm, but submitted 3 days late on January 21, will be not be docked. While an assignment submitted 8 days late on Thursday, January 26 will be docked 30%.<ul><li>In effect, all 48 hr self-declarations fall within this 5 day window. Self-declarations cannot be “stacked” to extend beyond these 5 days.</li></ul></li><li>Extensions outside of this 5 day period:<ul><li>requests made <strong>at least 24 hours BEFORE the posted due date</strong>: Extension requests can be made, via email, to the Instructor. The instructor will support extensions as long as they are requested in advance. No explanation is necessary. Please include the proposed extension length.</li><li>requests made <strong>ON or AFTER the posted due date</strong>: Extension requests on or after the posted assignment due date will only be considered if made through AccessAbility Services or the Verification of Illness notification system (see below).</li></ul></li><li>Failure to complete or hand in an assignment earns a zero on that project.</li><li>In-class activities are due the day of class, and require class attendance.</li></ul><h2><strong>Health &amp; Safety Policies</strong></h2><ul><li>To register an absence beyond the 48 hour self-declaration, please use the Verification of Illness system:<ul><li>If your absence is due to an <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#VIF">illness not pandemic-related</a>, then a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">UW Verification of Illness form</a>, completed by a health professional, must be uploaded and submitted through the <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/JR7GyDXnAb">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process.</a> The VIF is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not submit the VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.</li><li>If your absence is due to other <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">extenuating circumstances </a>(e.g., bereavement), then you must submit all documentation related to the absence (e.g., obituary) through the  <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/JR7GyDXnAb">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process.</a></li><li>Submission through the VIF or Extenuating Circumstances System, once approved, will notify your instructors of your absence. However, you are responsible for contacting your instructor to discuss accommodation arrangements.</li></ul></li><li>This <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/">resource</a> provides updated information on COVID-19 and guidance for accommodations due to COVID-19.</li><li>All students are required to follow health protocols mandated by both the province and the university, including those relating to social distancing and masking.</li><li>Students should not come to class or other in-person activities if they are experiencing COVID-19 or flu symptoms or are required to self-isolate.</li><li>Students are<strong> encouraged </strong>to wear masks inside the classroom, even if they are not currently mandated.</li><li>In the event of a<strong> short-term (e.g., one-week) cancellation of in-person classes</strong>, whether for the particular course or University-wide; the lecture content and in-class assignments for that week will be dropped from the syllabus, and the associated grades will be redistributed.</li><li>In the event of a <strong>longer-term cancellation of in-person classes</strong>, whether for the particular course or University-wide, we will shift to online learning. Each week will include live or pre-recorded lectures, as well as discussion and group activities accessed through LEARN, and collaborative reading activities using platforms such as Perusal. There will be no major changes to assessments and due dates, except that activities associated with in-class attendance will be due online, rather in in-class.</li></ul><p> </p>

However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will be discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions.</p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason.
