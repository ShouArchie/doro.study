<h3>Class Activities</h3><p>The classes will be interactive, with in-class activities most weeks to apply the concepts learned. These activities should be submitted on Learn Dropbox and are due mostly the day before the following week's class or in some cases, on a specified date before the subsequent week. They will be graded and account for 20% of the overall grade, with your lowest activity grade automatically dropped.</p><p><strong>You can do in-class activities even if you are absent, in which case you'll be marked out of 50% for that week's activity.</strong></p><h3>Assignments</h3><p>There will be two individual assignments due throughout the term. You must complete these alone, and only discuss high-level details with other students. </p><h3>Group Project</h3><p>There is a group project worth 40% of the grade for which you’ll work in teams of five (5). The project will have three major milestones, culminating in one large final presentation. You’ll work within your teams for all these milestones. </p><p>In Week 1, we’ll have a brief activity to form teams. Anyone absent during that week will be responsible for finding a team, though they can request assistance from the instructor. These teams will remain unchanged for the rest of the semester unless the instructor deems a change necessary.</p><p>All teams must be formed and finalized by <strong>Week 2’s class (Januray 16, 2025)</strong>. All students must <strong>self-enrol into a group on LEARN to finalize their teams</strong> (your spot is not secured until you are enrolled in a group on LEARN).</p><p>For the group project, you will complete three peer evaluations, one at the end of each milestone. Failure to submit a peer evaluation will result in a <strong>5% deduction from the individual's milestone grade</strong> but will not affect the group grade. Your feedback ensures that contributions are equitable, grading is fair, and any issues are addressed promptly.</p><h2>Submission Guidelines</h2><p><strong>Please note the following carefully</strong></p><ol><li>Whether it's an in-class activity, assignment or project milestone, submit as a <strong>single PDF Document</strong> on Learn by the deadline. <strong>Any other formats will be returned without a grade.</strong></li><li>Unless otherwise stated, <strong>individual assignments are usually due on Wednesdays</strong> at <strong>11:59pm EST</strong> (Eastern Standard Time) and <strong>group milestones are usually due on</strong> <strong>Fridays</strong> at 11:59pm EST.</li><li>Name the PDF file using a clear and consistent naming convention “<strong>LastName_FirstName_A1.pdf</strong>” (for assignment 1 and so on). </li><li>All in-class activities and assigments will be submitted in <strong>Dropboxes on LEARN</strong>. The Group project will be submitted on the LEARN group Dropbox (one submission per group). </li><li>Check all linked files, if there are any (e.g., Figma) are accessible by the instructor and TA. </li><li>Failure to submit to the correct folder, inconsistent naming conventions, or broken links will result in a <strong>5% penalty</strong>, as it makes it difficult for instructors and TAs to locate the files for grading.</li></ol><h2>Extensions &amp; Late Policy</h2><p>No extensions will be granted after a submission deadline. However, <strong>a 24-hour grace period</strong> applies to all individual and group deliverables, except the Figma Challenge and the Poster Presentation + Demo. This 24-hour grace period allows for late submissions without penalty and is intended for emergencies only; it is not an extension. After the grace period, <strong>a 5% per day penalty</strong> (including weekends) will be applied unless an officially approved extension is granted, supported by appropriate documentation (e.g., VIF). The grace period cannot be combined with approved extentions.</p><p>Please note that the <strong>TAs cannot extend</strong> assignment deadlines.</p><p>Acceptable extensions include the following:</p><h3>Verification of Illness</h3><p>To request accommodation due to illness, you must obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness Form</a> that a physician has filled out. The instructor will consider VIFs filled out and issued by the University of Waterloo's <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">Campus Wellness</a> Services (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services">Health Services</a> and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Counselling Services</a>).  The VIF is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness.</p><ul><li>Do not submit the VIF or other medical documentation to your instructor, teaching assistants, or other course personnel, but through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. </li><li>After submitting the form within 24 hours, contact your instructor to make alternate arrangements for the presentation and/or assignments.</li></ul><h3>Extenuating Circumstances</h3><p>In case of extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement), you must submit all documentation related to the absence (e.g., obituary) through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>.</p><ul><li>Do not submit the VIF or other documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel, but through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. </li><li>After submitting the form within 24 hours, contact your instructor to make alternate arrangements for the presentation and/or assignments.</li></ul><h3>Self-Declared Absences</h3><p>You can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest for pandemic-related reasons or short-term reasons:</p><ul><li>Short-term absence - up to 48 hours, no documentation required, not retroactive, and a maximum of one per term during the formal lecture period.</li><li>Pandemic-related absence - no in-person course activity is permitted. No documentation is required.</li><li>Self-declared absences are automatically tracked in Quest. False claims constitute an academic offence that will result in the disciplinary action under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 (Student Discipline)</a>.</li></ul><h2>Group Project</h2><p>All team members are expected to participate equally in these assignments. Extenuating circumstances, such as a medical or personal emergency, will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the instructors, and faculty reserve the right to decide on the availability of an alternative, even with credible documentation.</p><p>The instructor reserves full authority to assign a group mark for each team assignment. If an individual team</p><p>member has not carried a proportional workload or has not made themselves available for team work or submitted work of inferior quality such that other team members felt compelled to substantively re-do the work, instructors reserve the right to assign a grade that is proportionate to that individual’s contribution to the team. To substantiate any claims, a group member should provide evidence of unacceptable work or the need to “re-do” contributions by a team member. Contributing your fair share to the team assignments will yield benefits beyond a better individual grade, as fully functioning teams are much more likely to submit better work and be rewarded accordingly.</p><h2>Grading</h2><ol><li>Grading will follow the posted rubrics on LEARN. </li><li>Expect your grades and feedback about two to three weeks after submitting your assignment. We'll notify the class on LEARN if there's an unexpected delay.</li><li>Our goal is to enable you to do better and learn with each feedback and if you have any questions, first reach out to the teaching assistant who marked your submission within two weeks of receiving it. They'll be happy to provide additional feedback. Remember, contacting them after two weeks won't allow for a regrade, but they can still offer insights. You'll find the TA's name on your Learn feedback.</li><li>Still, have concerns? Feel free to contact the instructor about a regrade. The instructor may re-evaluate the entire assignment, which could result in a higher or lower grade, as they may identify details the TA missed.</li></ol><h2>Course Communication</h2><p>This class with use LEARN (<a href="http://learn.uwaterloo.ca/">learn.uwaterloo.ca</a>) as the primary communication tool—reminders, updates, discussions, readings and notes will be posted often. Students are expected to check LEARN frequently.</p><p>Please Note: This is a friendly reminder that you won’t gain access to the online learning systems</p><p>(LEARN) until your Registered Status on Quest for the term is “Fees Arranged.” Visit the Finance -</p><p>Student Accounts website to find out how to become "Fees Arranged" for the term. If you submitted a payment or Promissory Note more than three days ago and you're not yet "Fees Arranged," please contact <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/contact-us">The Centre</a> immediately to investigate: 519-888-4567 extension 42268, <a href="mailto:askthecentre@uwaterloo.ca">askthecentre@uwaterloo.ca</a>, via <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/contact-us">their webform</a>, or in-person: First Floor, Needles Hall South, between 8:30 &amp; 4:30 weekdays.</p><p>In addition, this course will use Teams with multiple channels that students can utilize to post questions and receive information. More details will be provided in class.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
