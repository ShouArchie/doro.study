<h3>Side Quests (Individual)</h3><p><strong>Due: Tuesday at 11:59 PM</strong>,<strong> the Week After the Class they are Assigned </strong></p><p>Side quests are weekly activities encouraging consistent engagement and skill development throughout the course. Each side quest consists of two parts: an in-class reflective paragraph focused on one of the week's games, exploring its mechanics, design, and relevance to course themes, and an out-of-class p5.js coding activity that reinforces technical concepts covered in the tutorials. Students must complete <strong><u>7 out of 9 side quests</u> </strong>by the week following their assigned class. These tasks provide a structured yet flexible approach to building analytical and coding skills.</p><h3>A1: Video Essay Analysis (Group) </h3><p><strong>Due: February 7  at 11:59 PM</strong></p><p>The video essay analysis is a group project that examines a tutorial level from a video game to foster critical thinking and analytical skills. In Week 2, students will receive a list of games primarily featuring one-player or co-op video games and an activity will be run to decide which game each group will analyze. Each group must select a different game, with separate lists provided for the morning and afternoon classes. We will form groups of 5 to 6 students during Week 2. Sections 1 and 3 and 2 and 4 will be taught collaboratively, allowing students to form mixed groups.</p><p>If you know you will be away during Week 2, you must join a group before class and notify the TAs in advance, including if you could join a group and any preferences regarding students you do not wish to work with. During class, students will form groups. If you are absent and did not form a group beforehand, the TAs will assign you to a group and a game with available space by the end of the day in Week 2. The TAs may add a student to groups with fewer than six members to balance group sizes.</p><p>These groups will remain consistent throughout the semester and collaborate on programming a short game using <strong>P5.js</strong> in later projects.</p><h3>A2: Low-Fidelity Game (Group)</h3><p><strong>Due: February 26 During Class</strong></p><p>The low-fidelity prototype is a group project where students will design a game to teach non-disabled players about a specific disability. Working in the same groups as the video essay, each group will select a disability-related topic during a class session in Week 4, where topics will be presented. Only one group may choose each subject; if a group is absent, a topic will be assigned to them. The prototype must include at least one functional level, showcasing the core mechanics and educational objectives, though visuals and designs can remain rough. This stage emphasizes brainstorming, iteration, and translating abstract ideas into tangible gameplay elements. Peer feedback and class presentations will help refine these early designs and prepare for the high-fidelity prototype.</p><h3>A3: High-Fidelity Game (Group)</h3><p><strong>Due: April 2 During Class</strong></p><p>The high-fidelity prototype is the final group project where students will refine and expand their low-fidelity game prototype using p5.js. Groups will build upon the core mechanics and educational objectives developed in A2 to create a polished, interactive game with at least two functional levels and a boss fight/additional level (depending on the genre of the game). This project emphasizes technical skills, creative problem-solving, and iterative design, requiring students to integrate player feedback and improve their game’s mechanics, visuals, and narrative.</p><p>The high-fidelity prototype must connect to the group’s chosen disability-related topic, showcasing how the game fosters understanding and empathy for non-disabled players. Groups will present their game to the class, highlighting their design choices, technical implementation, and iterative process. Peer feedback and self-reflection will be critical components of this assignment, helping students evaluate their learning and contributions.</p><p>This assignment challenges students to translate ideas into a functional product, applying theoretical concepts and technical expertise to create an impactful and educational gaming experience.</p><h3>Participation, Preparation and Engagement</h3><p><strong>Ongoing Deadlines</strong></p><p>Participation is an essential component of the course, designed to encourage active engagement in individual and collaborative in-class activities. Students are expected to contribute thoughtfully to class discussions, provide constructive feedback during peer presentations, and actively engage in group tasks during class. Meaningful participation includes asking questions, sharing insights, and supporting peers in refining their ideas and projects.</p><p>Regular attendance and consistent involvement in-class activities will be evaluated throughout the semester. This component fosters a dynamic and collaborative learning environment, ensuring that all students contribute to and benefit from the shared experiences of the class.</p>

  Notice of Recording
</h2>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Grading Policy</h4><p>This course recognizes the importance of timely feedback and transparency in the evaluation process. We have provided comprehensive rubrics for each assignment and will promptly give feedback. </p><p>Turnaround Time: We aim to release grades approximately two weeks after a crit or the final submission of an assignment. Kindly refrain from inquiring about grades before the designated two-week timeframe for release. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to provide you with feedback within the specified timeframe. </p><p>Communication: Please carefully review the rubric and comments provided with your grades. Should you have any questions or require clarification regarding your grade, please direct inquiries as a message on Teams to the respective instructor or TA responsible for marking your assignment. </p><p>Regrade requests: If you find the need for a regrade or seek clarification on your grade, you have a two-week window from the date of grade release to submit your request. It's important to note that regrades will involve a reassessment of the entire assignment rather than specific sections. Consequently, your overall mark may either increase or decrease. </p><h4>Late Work</h4><p>All assignments are due by the deadlines indicated on LEARN. For A1 and side quests, late submissions are subject to a penalty of 5% per day, including weekends. Penalties will be deducted from the grade received. Missing a presentation without accessibility accommodations, verification of illness, or extenuating circumstances will result in a grade of 0 for that component.</p><p>While self-declared absences are permitted, their use for group presentations is highly discouraged. A self-declared absence applies only to the individual and does not extend deadlines or provide accommodations for the group. Given the collaborative nature of the course and the logistical challenges of rescheduling group presentations, it is nearly impossible to present the project without all group members present. Students are encouraged to communicate with their group and the instructor well in advance if they foresee any challenges in meeting presentation deadlines.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code (e.g., ChatGPT, DALL-E, GitHub Copilot) are welcome and encouraged for use in this class, provided they are used responsibly, with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgment.</p><p><strong>Guidelines for Using GenAI:</strong></p><p><strong>Documentation:</strong></p><ul><li>You must explicitly state when and how you have used GenAI tools in your work, including image and sound generation.</li><li>Use the documentation template available on LEARN to outline your process and submit it with your assignments.</li><li>This includes grammar or spelling corrections from AI tools, including programs like Grammarly.</li><li>Failure to document the use of GenAI will be considered a violation of <strong>Policy 71</strong> (plagiarism or unauthorized aid/assistance).</li></ul><p><strong>Language Restriction:</strong></p><ul><li>All AI usage must be in English to ensure transparency and facilitate verification of appropriate use. While AI tools may assist with grammar and spelling corrections, they must not be used to translate from other languages into English.</li></ul><p><strong>Original Work and Integrity:</strong></p><ul><li>Work produced with uncredited assistance from AI tools does not represent the author’s original work. Submitting such work without proper acknowledgment violates academic integrity policies.</li><li>Running course materials through GenAI, using GenAI to complete assessments, or translating a text without credit is prohibited and will be treated as an academic offence.</li></ul><p><strong>Recommendations for Citing GenAI:</strong></p><ul><li>Follow the citation guidelines from the University of Waterloo Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai">Generative AI Citation Guide</a>.</li><li>Be aware that GenAI can falsify references, fabricate facts, or express ideas inaccurately. Use caution and verify the output for accuracy.</li></ul><p><strong>Legal and Copyright Considerations:</strong></p><ul><li>The copyright status of GenAI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using substantial portions of AI-generated content, especially images. Consult the Copyright Advisory Committee’s guidelines for more information: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">Copyright and Generative AI</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Student Responsibility:</strong></p><ul><li>You are responsible for all work submitted in this class, including assignments and presentations incorporating GenAI tools. Any AI usage must:<ol><li>Be explicitly stated within your submission.</li><li>Include the documentation template detailing the GenAI tool, purpose, and outputs.</li></ol></li></ul><p> </p><h4>Working in Teams</h4><p>The syllabus specifies both individual and group assignments. Each student must complete individual assignments independently. Collaboration on producing individual deliverables (i.e., Side Quests) constitutes unauthorized collaboration as outlined in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71.</a><br/><br/>Group assignments must be completed collaboratively, including effectively managing goals, tasks, and workflow, completing deliverables on time and schedule, managing change and learning from mistakes, and engaging in healthy conflict. Each team member is expected to make tangible contributions to the project, drawing from their expertise and/or developing new skills and expertise. These contributions will be assessed in an evaluation for each group assignment; a written contribution response is required in the appendix of each group assignment. More details on this will be available in the individual assignment outlines. </p><p>For the group assignments, each team member will receive the same “basis” for their grade on the report. At the same time, the instructor can adjust individual contributions, or lack thereof, based on the feedback from the peer review quiz. This means you must directly contribute to the project's development and make your team work effectively.</p><p>Also, during the semester, as soon as you perceive that a member consistently does not make a fair contribution to the team, you are responsible for communicating this to the instructor to resolve such issues <strong>as soon as possible</strong> and not wait until late in the term or after a deliverable has been submitted. When you contact the instructor, please include any additional work you had to complete on behalf of your group member, along with proof that you at least attempted to reach out to your group member and waited a reasonable amount of time for a response. </p><p>If the instructor finds that no team member has approached the non-contributing student to encourage them to contribute, this policy does not apply, and there are no penalties. </p><p>When there is deemed a lack of contribution from one or more of the group members, the grade of the deliverable does not increase for the other team members who did contribute to the final submission. The deliverable is graded initially without considering the lack of contribution to have a baseline grade that the deliverable has earned. At this point, the quality of the deliverable does not increase because of the lack of contribution issues. This means the baseline grade is the highest grade the deliverable has earned, and therefore, that is the highest grade that can be offered to a student on the team that submitted the deliverable. </p><p>The following penalty guidelines will be used to examine and categorize each lack of contribution case:</p><p>No penalty: To the best of their ability, the group members meet the deadlines and expectations agreed upon in the group charter. </p><p>10% penalty*: One or more group members have attempted to reach out to the student and have not engaged or communicated with the group within a reasonable amount of time. The work submitted by the student was given to the group in a reasonable amount of time, but it was not as the group deemed acceptable and needed to be redone mostly. </p><p>25% penalty*: If the student contributed at least half of their expected work, but not all content, in a reasonable amount of time, it was not as the group deemed acceptable and needed to be mostly re-done. This assumes one or more group members have attempted to reach out to the student to engage. </p><p>50% penalty*: If the student contributed less than half of their expected work in a reasonable amount of time, it was not as the group deemed acceptable and needed to be mostly re-done. This assumes one or more group members have attempted to reach out to the student to engage. </p><p>100% penalty*: If the student did not contribute any work of their own in a reasonable amount of time and/or if the work was stolen, bought, or used from a different course. If a student did not contribute any work, this is considered an academic offence, and an investigation into the project will be conducted. </p><p>* % penalty applied to the graded portion of the deliverable. For example, if a 10% penalty was applied and the student earned 60 points out of 100 and the 10% penalty was applied, the student would have a 6-point reduction based on the 10% of the 60 points earned. </p><h4>Electronic Device Policy</h4><p>This course uses electronic devices (laptops, and we will use programs in the class, such as p5.ja and Teams. Please do not access unrelated materials during class time. Presentation slides, links, and extra materials will be provided following each class. </p><p>You are welcome to use any assistive technology in the classroom. If you need any support or modifications due to your disability in course activities, please let the instructor know by the second week of class. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policies/policy-58-accessibility">Policy 58</a>. </p><h4>Instructor Contact</h4><p>The instructor is available to answer questions outside of class. However, they have other responsibilities and will sometimes be unavailable for support. Please post any general questions you have on our TEAMS channel, and the instructor, a TA, or even another student can answer. If you have any personal questions, you can send a direct message to both the instructors on TEAMS indicating you are a student in GBDA 302. Please <strong><u>do not</u></strong> email the instructors unless the instructors specifically request it.</p><h4><strong>Academic Offences</strong></h4><p>If a student is suspected of engaging in unauthorized collaboration, plagiarism, unauthorized aid or assistance, misrepresentation, copying of one's work from another class assessment, or theft of intellectual property, they will be reported by the instructor to the Associate Dean of Arts.</p><p>When grades are released, the student will receive a comment on the ungraded assignment stating concerns about an academic offence and that they are being investigated. No other information will be able to be released to the student until the investigation is complete.</p><p>For group work, you must identify the portions of the assignment you were responsible for on the peer review quiz. If there are concerns about plagiarism and identification is absent, all students in the group will be held responsible for violations of academic integrity in the group submission. </p><p>Once the investigation is complete, if no academic offence is found, the student or group will receive their grade as normal. However, if there is an academic office, the student or group will receive an email from the instructor or the Associate Dean of Arts office indicating concerns about plagiarism. </p><p>The severity of the penalty for plagiarism depends on the quantity of plagiarized content and the extent to which the student failed to attribute the plagiarized materials. The impact of the penalty also depends on the value of the submission. Extenuating circumstances are sometimes considered case-by-case, and sometimes less severe penalties are considered. Repeat offenders will receive more severe penalties. </p><p>If your assignment is flagged for plagiarism, you have two choices: accept the allegation and penalty. Then, you will receive an official resolution letter from the Associate Dean. You can request a formal investigation to dispute the allegation and penalty. If so, you will meet directly with the Associate Dean to discuss your objections and relevant evidence. </p><p>Read<strong> </strong>the University of Waterloo <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70"><u>Policy 70 </u></a>(Student petitions and grievances), <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (Student discipline), and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72"><u>Policy 72</u></a> (Student appeals), and they will provide you with information regarding the procedures that will take place.</p><h3>Stratford School Information and Policies</h3><h4><strong>Academic Accommodations </strong></h4><p>As a student, you can seek accommodation for assignments missed due to circumstances beyond your control, such as illness or emergency. The instructor will not consider extensions unless a short-term absence or the submission and approval of a verification of illness or extenuating circumstance form is used. They will not accept any medical or official documentation and should not be alerted to details about the circumstances in which you are absent. For additional support, please contact GBDA advising at <a href="mailto:gbda.advising@uwaterloo.ca"><u>gbda.advising@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or the Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies.</p><h4><strong>Verification of Illness  </strong></h4><p>To request an accommodation for a missed assessment due to illness, you must obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services"><u>Verification of Illness Form</u></a> that a physician has filled out. Instructors will consider VIFs filled out and issued by the University of Waterloo's <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/"><u>Campus Wellness</u></a> Services (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services"><u>Health Services</u></a> and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services"><u>Counselling Services</u></a>).  The VIF is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not submit the VIF or other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel, but through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. After submitting the form within 24 hours, contact your instructor to make alternate arrangements for the presentation and/or assignments. If the approved VIF is for a group presentation, the group will be allowed to present at a later date of mutual convenience for the instructor and TA.</p><h3><strong>Extenuating Circumstances</strong></h3><p>Suppose your absence is due to other extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement). In that case, you must submit all documentation related to the absence (e.g., obituary) through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>.

While your absence is excused, the other group members will still be responsible for completing their assigned presentation portion as outlined in the group charter. The remaining group members will be responsible for delivering their sections and potentially adapting the presentation to accommodate your absence. The absent group member will be required to complete their part of the presentation separately with the instructor within 48 hours after the class's scheduled presentation time, or they will receive a 0.</p><p>Pandemic-related absence: no in-person course activity is permitted. No documentation is required. Similar to short-term absence, the group member can either participate in the presentation remotely or present their portion of the assignment separately with the instructor after the isolation period. </p><p>Self-declared absences are automatically false claims that constitute an academic offence that will result in disciplinary action under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71 (Student Discipline)</u></a>. </p><h3><strong>Co-Op Interview Conflicts</strong></h3><p>We are not required to accommodate co-op interview conflicts; however, the following guidelines apply:</p><p><strong>Regular Classes (Non-Presentation Days):</strong></p><ul><li>You may leave class for your interview but are expected to attend around the interview time.</li><li>Missing the entire class will result in a <strong>0 for participation</strong> that day.</li></ul><p><strong>Off-Campus Interviews:</strong></p><ul><li>If your interview requires you to travel to a location different from the Stratford campus, you must request a <strong>location accommodation</strong> by submitting the <strong>Interview Conflict Form</strong> via WaterlooWorks.</li></ul><p><strong>Interviews during Presentations:</strong></p><ul><li>For interviews that conflict with a scheduled presentation, you must submit the <strong>Interview Conflict Form</strong> on WaterlooWorks as soon as possible to explore accommodations.

Academic freedom carries the duty to use that freedom consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment that fosters free debate may occasionally include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with openly, respectfully and sensitively.” This definition is repeated in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policies 70</a> and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">71</a> and the <a href="https://outline.uwaterloo.ca/view/Memorandum%20of%20Agreement,%20Section%206">Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</a>. </p><h4><strong>Anti-Colonialism, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (AD-EDI) </strong></h4><p>The Stratford School of Interaction Design and Business considers anti-racism, decolonization, equity, diversity, and inclusion (AD-EDI) essential to our collective responsibility as a community. As part of our commitment to academic excellence, we address systemic racism, discrimination, and bias within our classrooms, disciplines, and communities. We are committed to creating inclusive environments that centre the perspectives, voices, and experiences of individuals from equity-deserving groups, including, but not limited to: Black and Indigenous individuals; people of colour; women-identified, non-binary, agender, and gender-nonconforming individuals; 2SLGBTQ+ individuals; persons with disabilities; and people from other racialized, marginalized, and underrepresented communities. We see it as a shared responsibility to learn, support, and implement evidence-based best practices that uphold the values of AD-EDI.  </p><h4><strong>Scent Policy</strong></h4><p>The University of Waterloo recognizes that exposure to scented products can adversely affect individuals' health, leading to rashes, severe headaches, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. These reactions can occur even at low levels of exposure. The university advises students, employees, and visitors to avoid using scented products indoors to promote a healthy environment.</p><p>Scented products include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Perfumes and colognes</li><li>Aftershaves</li><li>Essential oils</li><li>Scented lotions</li><li>Hair sprays and other hair products</li><li>Scented deodorants</li><li>Fragranced cosmetics</li><li>Laundry detergents and fabric softeners with added fragrances</li><li>Air fresheners and scented candles</li></ul><p>Students should refrain from wearing or bringing strongly scented products into the classroom due to the instructor's severe reactions to even minor scents. Failure to comply with this policy will result in being asked to leave the classroom, thereby missing in-class activities and lectures for that day.</p><p>Please ensure that any food you bring into the classroom has no strong scent. Additionally, be mindful of classmates' allergies to avoid triggering adverse reactions.</p><p>By adhering to this scent-free policy, we contribute to a healthier and more inclusive environment for everyone.</p><h4><strong>Chosen/Preferred Name </strong></h4><p>Do you want professors and staff to call you by a different first name?

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
