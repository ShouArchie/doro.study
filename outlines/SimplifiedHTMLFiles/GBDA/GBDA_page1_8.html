<h3>Data Analysis Project</h3><p>The best way to understand something is to experience it for yourself, which is the purpose of this individual project. The project generally involves the following steps. <br/>1.           Choose your variable(s) and identify a research question <br/>2.           Devise a plan to collect your data<br/>3.           Submit a project video proposal on LEARN and obtain the instructor’s approval (Due by February 14, Friday)<br/>4.           Once your research question and data collection plan are approved, carry out your research: <br/>a)           Collect and organize data <br/>b)           Conduct the appropriate analysis <br/>c)           Compile your results in a poster report <br/>5.           Submit your final project. (Due by April 7 Monday)<br/><br/>•            Data collection<br/>Data collection can be done online (e.g., online surveys, remote interviews, or from some external reliable public data source such as Statistics Canada). For example, you could conduct a survey of people’s preference for online video streaming software. If you are a basketball fan, you could investigate how an external factor impacts the Raptors’ performance.<br/><br/>You can also collect data in person from yourself or somebody else when this is reasonable and feasible. Some ideas for personal quantitative data collection include but are not limited to music listening habits, sleep patterns, daily calorie intake, daily exercise activity levels, and your pet’s behaviour. For example, using the music listening topic, you could propose to investigate whether there is a correlation between the time spent using the computer and the time spent listening to music over the course of a week. <br/><br/>At least some of the data you collect should be of quantitative nature. Regardless of which methods you use or the data collected, we highly recommend keeping your research question feasible and straightforward. In any circumstances, data collecting process should closely follow the COVID prevention guidance from Public Health Ontario. <br/><br/>•            Part 1: Video Proposal<br/>Make a video about a research question on some variables of interest and your data collection plans. Start with a brief self-introduction; introduce yourself and why you are interested in your research question, then lead to an explanation of the variables to be included in your analysis and how you are planning to collect the data. <br/>The idea proposed in the video will form the basis of your Data Analysis Project. The purpose of the video proposal is to receive early feedback from the instructor and TAs about the feasibility, scope, and merit of your research idea. You may propose multiple ideas (and make a longer video) if you want to receive feedback about which idea has more potential.<br/><br/>The proposal will be graded based on the merit of your proposed research idea and data collection plan using a simple three-point system: Pass, pass-with-minor-revisions, pass-with-major-revisions. Grading is at the discretion of the instructor and TAs. </p><p><br/><br/>•            Part 2: Data Analysis and Poster Report<br/>Continuing with the proposed project idea, collect, organize, and analyze your data. Summarize your methodology and findings in a research poster. The instructor will guide the poster content and format on LEARN.<br/><br/>•            Deliverables Submissions<br/>Upload your deliverable files to LEARN as a single ZIP file. Label the submission in the format: firstname_lastname_deliverable-name</p><h3>Exercises</h3><p>Three exercises focus on the theoretical and application of stats concepts. The exercises are to be completed online using LEARN's Quiz feature. You will have plenty of time to complete the exercises asynchronously. </p><h3>Class Participation</h3><p>Weekly surveys are required to be submitted by the end of Sundays each week. Instructions on how to finish these surveys will be announced at the beginning of the semester. Other class activities than the weekly surveys may be regularly assigned throughout. Students’ responses are evaluated based on participation, quality and efforts.</p>
</div>
<a></a>
<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h3>Late Work </h3><p>Unless otherwise stated, all course deliverables are due at 11:59 pm EST (Eastern Standard Time) or EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) on the due date. <br/><br/>•            Data Analysis Project (proposal and poster reports)<br/>Extensions can only be granted on an individual basis under exceptional circumstances.  Deliverables handed in late without granted extensions will be penalized by a deduction of 10% per 24-hour period, or part thereof, out of the final mark received.  <br/><br/>•            Exercises<br/>No late exercises will be accepted unless there are exceptional circumstances AND such situations are communicated prior to the deadline of the missed exercise. Otherwise, a mark of zero will be given for the missed exercise. Whether a late work will be accepted and whether a penalty will be applied are subject to the instructor's judgment on a case by case scenario. </p><h2>Information on Plagiarism Detection </h2><p>If a student is suspected of engaging in unauthorized collaboration, plagiarism, unauthorized aid or assistance, misrepresentation, copying of one's work from another class assessment, or theft of intellectual property, they will be reported by the instructor to the Associate Dean of Arts.<br/><br/>When grades are released, the student will receive a comment on the ungraded assignment stating concerns about an academic offence and that they are being investigated. No other information will be able to be released to the student until the investigation is complete.<br/><br/>The severity of the penalty for plagiarism depends on the quantity of plagiarized content and the extent to which the student failed to attribute the plagiarized materials. The impact of the penalty also depends on the value of the submission. Extenuating circumstances are sometimes considered case-by-case, and sometimes less severe penalties are considered. Repeat offenders will receive more severe penalties. <br/><br/>If your assignment is flagged for plagiarism, you have two choices: accept the allegation and penalty, or request a formal investigation. If you pursue the first choice, then, you will receive an official resolution letter from the Associate Dean. Alternatively, you can also request a formal investigation to dispute the allegation and penalty. If so, you will meet directly with the Associate Dean to discuss your objections and relevant evidence. <br/><br/>Read the University of Waterloo Policy 70 (Student petitions and grievances), Policy 71 (Student discipline), and Policy 72 (Student appeals), and they will provide you with information regarding the procedures that will take place.</p><h2>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)</h2><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. instructions.</p><p> </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors, and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</a></p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this course, including any supported by generative AI.</p><h2>Grading Policy</h2><p>This course recognizes the importance of timely feedback and transparency in the evaluation process. <br/><br/>We have provided comprehensive rubrics for each assignment and will promptly give feedback. <br/>Turnaround Time: We aim to release grades approximately two weeks after a crit or the final submission of an assignment. Kindly refrain from inquiring about grades before the designated two-week timeframe for release. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to provide you with feedback within the specified timeframe. <br/><br/>Communication: Please carefully review the rubric and comments provided with your grades. Should you have any questions or require clarification regarding your grade, please direct inquiries as a message on Teams to the respective instructor or TA responsible for marking your assignment. <br/><br/>Regrade requests: If you find the need for a regrade or seek clarification on your grade, you have a two-week window from the date of grade release to submit your request. It's important to note that regrades will involve a reassessment of the entire assignment rather than specific sections. Consequently, your overall mark may either increase or decrease.</p><h2>Attendance Policy</h2><p>Successful completion of the course relies on consistent weekly participation. This course is an online learning without an allocated synchronous session. As such, students are expected to study the assigned learning materials at your own pace. The attendance will be mainly monitored through the Weekly Surveys, which is worth 15% of your grade.  Students are expected to finish these weekly survey about their learning progress online by Sundays. </p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>

Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
