<ol><li>Class Participation (15% of final grade)</li></ol><p>Students’ class participation is evaluated, including but not limited to in-class questions, and in-class peers’ evaluation of other groups’ presentations.  The breakdown of the class participation is as follows.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Participation </strong></td><td><strong>Percentage</strong></td></tr><tr><td>In-class lecture questions</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>In-class peer presentation evaluation</td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td>Instructor's observation</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table></figure><ol><li>Individual Report (20%)</li></ol><p>This assessment is for students to demonstrate their understanding of the nature, characteristics, and patterns of conducting international business in real life. Students will identify a real Canadian company operating internationally and choose one of the foreign countries in which it mainly operates. The report should describe the company’s business, the analysis of the cultural, economic, political and legal environment of the selected foreign country, and the company’s operations in that country. For further details, please see the rubric of the individual report to be posted on LEARN. <br/><br/>Each student must submit their own individual reports online. Students may talk to the instructor, TAs or fellow students for assistance in understanding concepts but must complete this assignment themselves. Note that completing an assignment for another student or allowing another student to complete an assignment for you is an academic offence.</p><ol><li>Quiz 1 and Quiz 2 (Each worth 15% of final grade)</li></ol><p>Two quizzes will be done in class. The dates of the quizzes can be found on the class schedule below.<br/><br/>The quizzes are designed to demonstrate students’ learning and understanding of concepts and tools covered during the term.  They are supposed to be open books and individual work. You should NOT discuss or collaborate with your classmates while finishing the quizzes. Please see the university policy on “Academic Integrity” in a later section of this syllabus. <br/><br/>Further information on the quizzes will be announced on LEARN and in class when the dates are approaching.</p><ol><li>Project (35% of final grade)</li></ol><p>The class will be divided into teams of 3 to 5 students to finish the team project. The project has two components: a country presentation and a final business proposal submission. <br/>A.           Country presentation (10% of final grade)<br/>Each team is expected to analyze and present a foreign nation of their selection. The presentation will give a broad outline of the nation’s current business environment, the opportunities that the nation presents to Canadian companies and the culture and customs of that country that a Canadian company should consider before starting to do business with or in that country. <br/><br/>You can select a country based on your interest. Your country presentation should be between 10 to 15 minutes. You are not required to have a formal slide presentation. Be creative and use whatever methods or visual aids that may work to make the presentation informative, interesting and interactive.  A schedule of team country presentations in class will be announced once team assignments are done at the beginning of the term.  <br/><br/>B.           Final business proposal (25% of final grade)<br/>Each team will be developing a business idea that either<br/>•            Serve a local market in the country you select in the country presentation OR<br/>•            Target a group of people in Canada who are coming from the country you select in the country presentation. <br/><br/>Your business idea can be a physical product, a digital product or a service, due by the deadline described on the class schedule below.<br/><br/>Rubrics of the country presentation and business proposal will be available at the beginning of the semester on LEARN.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
</p>
<div>
</div>
<a></a>
<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h2>Late Work </h2><p>Unless otherwise stated, all course deliverables are due at 11:59 pm on the due dates indicated on the Class Schedule. Late submissions of evaluation items to the LEARN drop boxes are subject to a penalty of 5% per day, including weekends. Penalties will be deducted from the grade received. <br/><br/>Missing a presentation or an in-class quiz without accessibility accommodations, verification of illness, or extenuating circumstances will result in a grade of 0 for that component.</p><h2>Information on Plagiarism Detection </h2><p>If a student is suspected of engaging in unauthorized collaboration, plagiarism, unauthorized aid or assistance, misrepresentation, copying of one's work from another class assessment, or theft of intellectual property, they will be reported by the instructor to the Associate Dean of Arts.<br/><br/>When grades are released, the student will receive a comment on the ungraded assignment stating concerns about an academic offence and that they are being investigated. No other information will be able to be released to the student until the investigation is complete.<br/><br/>The severity of the penalty for plagiarism depends on the quantity of plagiarized content and the extent to which the student failed to attribute the plagiarized materials. The impact of the penalty also depends on the value of the submission. Extenuating circumstances are sometimes considered case-by-case, and sometimes less severe penalties are considered. Repeat offenders will receive more severe penalties. <br/><br/>If your assignment is flagged for plagiarism, you have two choices: accept the allegation and penalty or request a formal investigation. If you pursue the first choice, then, you will receive an official resolution letter from the Associate Dean. Alternatively, you can also request a formal investigation to dispute the allegation and penalty. If so, you will meet directly with the Associate Dean to discuss your objections and relevant evidence. <br/><br/>Read the University of Waterloo Policy 70 (Student petitions and grievances), Policy 71 (Student discipline), and Policy 72 (Student appeals), and they will provide you with information regarding the procedures that will take place.</p><h2>Electronic Device Policy</h2><p>This course uses electronic devices to access LEARN.  Please do not access unrelated materials during class time. You are welcome to use any assistive technology in the classroom. If you need any support or modifications due to your disability in course activities, please let the instructor know by the second week of class. For more information, please refer to Policy 58.</p><h2>Attendance Policy</h2><p>•            Attendance - Successful completion of the course relies on consistent weekly participation, in class. Students are expected to attend class each week (3 hours) and allocate additional time for gathering materials and ensure proper preparation. Students are expected to attend their registered section and be on time consistently.  <br/>•            Missing class – Students are responsible for knowing the material and announcements presented during class whether or not you attend class. Please arrange with another student to get missed notes or announcements. An excellent way to get in touch with fellow students is on Learn or on Teams. <br/>•            Chronic Absenteeism – Successful completion of this course relies on in-class activity that fosters a collaborative learning community. Since most material for quizzes come from in class content delivery activities, students striving for top grades should expect to attend a proportionate number of classes to reflect this. </p><h2>Scent in the Classroom Policy</h2><p>The University of Waterloo recognizes that exposure to scented products can adversely affect individuals' health, leading to rashes, severe headaches, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. These reactions can occur even at low levels of exposure. The university advises students, employees, and visitors to avoid using scented products indoors to promote a healthy environment.</p><p>Scented products include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Perfumes and colognes</li><li>Aftershaves</li><li>Essential oils</li><li>Scented lotions</li><li>Hair sprays and other hair products</li><li>Scented deodorants</li><li>Fragranced cosmetics</li><li>Laundry detergents and fabric softeners with added fragrances</li><li>Air fresheners and scented candles</li></ul><p>Students should refrain from wearing or bringing strongly scented products into the classroom as sensitive individuals may have severe reactions to even minor scents. Failure to comply with this policy will result in being asked to leave the classroom, thereby missing in-class activities and lectures for that day.</p><p>Please ensure that any food you bring into the classroom has no strong scent. Additionally, be mindful of classmates' allergies to avoid triggering adverse reactions.</p><p>By adhering to this scent-free policy, we contribute to a healthier and more inclusive environment for everyone."</p><h2>Grading Policy</h2><h2>This course recognizes the importance of timely feedback and transparency in the evaluation process. We have provided comprehensive rubrics for each assignment and will promptly give feedback. </h2><p>Turnaround Time: We aim to release grades approximately two weeks after a crit or the final submission of an assignment. Kindly refrain from inquiring about grades before the designated two-week timeframe for release. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to provide you with feedback within the specified timeframe. </p><p>Communication: Please carefully review the rubric and comments provided with your grades. Should you have any questions or require clarification regarding your grade, please direct inquiries as a message on Teams to the respective instructor or TA responsible for marking your assignment. </p><p>Regrade requests: If you find the need for a regrade or seek clarification on your grade, you have a two-week window from the date of grade release to submit your request. It's important to note that regrades will involve a reassessment of the entire assignment rather than specific sections. Consequently, your overall mark may either increase or decrease. </p><h2>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)</h2><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, are not allowed in finishing the assignments. </p><p><strong>Work must be made by you </strong></p><p>The purpose of this course is to develop your ability to articulate your thoughts about course concepts through a variety of media. This gives you experience to sharpen your skills before entering the job market as a professional. </p><p>Your grades in this course are based upon the work you create in response to course concepts. If a substantial part of that work is made by someone else—or something else—then we're not judging your developing skills, but rather theirs. Because of this, you are not allowed to use work made by others in this course. Work must be made by you. This means you cannot use templates, imagery, video, sound effects, music, or text made by others, whether made by a person or by generative AI. Students who have produced work demonstrably made, or reasonably suspected of having been made, with such materials will be referred to the Associate Dean of Arts (Undergraduate) for discipline according to Policy 71. </p><p><strong>How can I avoid suspicion? </strong></p><p>First, make your own content: this gives you practice for your career. </p><p>Second, save your draft work. For example, if you create an image, save the original file along with the processed final result. To demonstrate your authorship, retain original files, notes, and drafts. You may be asked to submit these along with earlier drafts of work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document.</p><h2>Working in Teams</h2><p>The syllabus specifies both individual and group assignments. Each student must complete individual assignments independently. Collaboration on producing individual deliverables constitutes unauthorized collaboration as outlined in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71.</a><br/><br/>Group assignments must be completed collaboratively, including effectively managing goals, tasks, and workflow, completing deliverables on time and schedule, managing change and learning from mistakes, and engaging in healthy conflict. Each team member is expected to make tangible contributions to the project, drawing from their expertise and/or developing new skills and expertise. These contributions will be assessed in an evaluation for each group assignment; a written contribution response is required in the appendix of each group assignment. More details on this will be available in the individual assignment outlines. </p><p>For the group assignments, each team member will receive the same “basis” for their grade on the report. At the same time, the instructor can adjust individual contributions, or lack thereof, based on the feedback from the peer review quiz. This means you must directly contribute to the project's development and make your team work effectively.</p><p>Also, during the semester, as soon as you perceive that a member consistently does not make a fair contribution to the team, you are responsible for communicating this to the instructor to resolve such issues <strong>as soon as possible</strong> and not wait until late in the term or after a deliverable has been submitted. When you contact the instructor, please include any additional work you had to complete on behalf of your group member, along with proof that you at least attempted to reach out to your group member and waited a reasonable amount of time for a response. </p><p>If the instructor finds that no team member has approached the non-contributing student to encourage them to contribute, this policy does not apply, and there are no penalties. </p><p>When there is deemed a lack of contribution from one or more of the group members, the grade of the deliverable does not increase for the other team members who did contribute to the final submission. The deliverable is graded initially without considering the lack of contribution to have a baseline grade that the deliverable has earned. At this point, the quality of the deliverable does not increase because of the lack of contribution issues. This means the baseline grade is the highest grade the deliverable has earned, and therefore, that is the highest grade that can be offered to a student on the team that submitted the deliverable. </p><p>The following penalty guidelines will be used to examine and categorize each lack of contribution case:</p><p>No penalty: To the best of their ability, the group members meet the deadlines and expectations agreed upon in the group charter. </p><p>10% penalty*: One or more group members have attempted to reach out to the student and have not engaged or communicated with the group within a reasonable amount of time. The work submitted by the student was given to the group in a reasonable amount of time, but it was not as the group deemed acceptable and needed to be redone mostly. </p><p>25% penalty*: If the student contributed at least half of their expected work, but not all content, in a reasonable amount of time, it was not as the group deemed acceptable and needed to be mostly re-done. This assumes one or more group members have attempted to reach out to the student to engage. </p><p>50% penalty*: If the student contributed less than half of their expected work in a reasonable amount of time, it was not as the group deemed acceptable and needed to be mostly re-done. This assumes one or more group members have attempted to reach out to the student to engage. </p><p>100% penalty*: If the student did not contribute any work of their own in a reasonable amount of time and/or if the work was stolen, bought, or used from a different course. If a student did not contribute any work, this is considered an academic offence, and an investigation into the project will be conducted. </p><p>* % penalty applied to the graded portion of the deliverable. For example, if a 10% penalty was applied and the student earned 60 points out of 100 and the 10% penalty was applied, the student would have a 6-point reduction based on the 10% of the 60 points earned. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>.
