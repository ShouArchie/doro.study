<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Students and faculty at the University of Waterloo share an important responsibility to maintain the integrity of the teaching and learning relationship. This relationship is characterized by honesty, fairness, and mutual respect for the aim and principles of the pursuit of education. Academic misconduct impedes the activities of the university community and is punishable by appropriate disciplinary action. <br/><br/>Instructors and TAs reserve the right to use electronic means to detect and help prevent plagiarism. Students agree that by taking this course all assignments are subject to submission via software for textual similarity (e.g., Turnitin.com or Grammarly) or visual similarity (e.g., Google Reverse Image Search). Other tools may be used. Regarding Turnitin.com: assignments submitted to Turnitin.com will be included as source documents in their restricted access database solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism in such documents for five academic years. The instructor may require students to submit their assignments electronically to Turnitin.com or the instructor may submit questionable text on behalf of a student.

<h3>Assessment</h3><h4>What Does My Grade Mean?</h4><p><strong>A+ (90–100): </strong>This mark is for exceptional work that demonstrates a profound understanding of the issues presented in class. It indicates work that is <i><strong>well above average</strong></i><strong> </strong><i><strong>for GBDA students</strong></i>. The work demonstrates a professional level of involvement and execution on the part of the student, and stands on its own terms outside of the context of a school assignment.</p><p><strong>A (80-89): </strong>This mark is for exceptional work that, to varying degrees, demonstrates a thorough understanding of the issues presented in class. It indicates work that is <i><strong>above average</strong></i><strong> </strong><i><strong>for GBDA students</strong></i>. The work demonstrates a deep involvement on the part of the student, and could stand on its own terms outside of the context of a school assignment.</p><p><strong>B (70-79): </strong>This mark is for notable work that, to varying degrees, shows that the student has understood the topic and has made every effort to fulfil the requirements of the assignment to the best of his or her ability. It indicates <i><strong>work of the expected quality for GBDA students, and represents good work</strong></i>.</p><p><strong>C (60-69): </strong>This mark is for satisfactory/acceptable work, to varying degrees: for example, it may be successful on one level, but fails on another. Alternately, the work may reflect a good deal of effort, but it does not adequately address the topic at hand. It is <i><strong>not quite up to GBDA standards</strong></i>. After having followed recommendations by the instructor, future work should do meet GBDA standards.</p><p><strong>D (50-59): </strong>This mark is for barely adequate work, to varying degrees: the work displays minimal effort and commitment on the part of the student and/or conveys an insufficient understanding of the topic. It is <i><strong>below GBDA standards</strong></i>, and significantly more effort would be required to meet those standards. </p><p><strong>F (33-49): </strong>This mark is for insufficient or incomplete work, to varying degrees, and is marked as a fail. It indicates work that is <i><strong>well below GBDA standards</strong></i>, and future work would require substantially improved effort to meet GBDA standards.</p><h4>How are Assignments Marked?</h4><p>Each assignment has a corresponding rubric which outlines how that assignment is marked. When we hand back work, we grade and provide feedback based upon that rubric. We recommend you famliarize yourself with the rubrics and also read the feedback. </p><p>Assignments are divided up according to their final value: for example, if an assignment is worth 20% of your final mark, we grade on a 20-point scale, not a 100-point scale. Each evaluation on the rubric is divided up according the letter-grade scale, so the numbers may seem peculiar at first. If a component on the rubric is worth a small amount, then some of the letter grades are removed. For example., if a component is worth 1.5%, we typically retain A+, B, D, and F, but drop A and C. </p><h4>Late Work</h4><p>All assignments are due by the deadlines indicated on <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home/1103245">LEARN</a> (subject to accommodations, verification of illness, or extenuating circumstances). Late submissions are subject to a penalty of 5% per day, including weekends. Submissions a week late receive a 0. Penalties will be deducted from the grade received. Missing a presentation without accessibility accommodations, verification of illness, or extenuating circumstances will result in the student receiving a grade of 0 for that component. </p><h3>Work Must be Made by You (Plagiarism &amp; AI Use Policy)</h3><p>The ultimate purpose of this course is to develop your ability to articulate your thoughts about course concepts through a variety of media. This gives you experience to sharpen your skills before entering the job market as a professional.</p><p>Your grades in this course are based upon the work you create in response to course concepts. If a substantial part of that work is made by someone else—or some<i>thing</i> else—then we're not judging your developing skills, but rather theirs. Because of this, <strong>you are not allowed to use work made by others in this course. Work must be made by you.</strong> This means you cannot use templates, imagery, video, sound effects, music, or text made by others, whether made by a person or generated by any form of AI (such ChatGPT, Claude, or Midjourney). Students who have produced work demonstrably made, or reasonably suspected of having been made, with such materials will be referred to the Associate Dean of Arts (Undergraduate) for discipline according to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a>.</p><h4>How Can I Avoid Suspicion of Plagiarism/AI Use?</h4><p>First of all, <i>make your own content:</i> this gives you practice for your career.</p><p>Second, <i>save your draft work</i>. To demonstrate your authorship, retain original files, notes, and drafts. You may be asked to submit these along with earlier drafts of work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. For example, if you create a sound effect, save the original file along with the processed final result.</p><h4>Copyright-Free &amp; Creative Commons Resources: <br/>Permission to Use Must Be Explicitly Given to Use These</h4><p><i>If</i> you are allowed to use other people's work—which will only be done rarely, when the instructor explicitly states that you can do so—then follow some very simple rules. First of all, <strong>avoid plagiarism by citing your work</strong>: provide all appropriate information about the title, author, and source of your content. Second, <strong>use only resources with licenses that allow you to do so</strong>.</p><p>Works may be available in the "public domain" that are identified as copyright-free or that fall under licenses from Creative Commons. "Public domain" is a term used for works that are not protected by copyright law. If an image is in the public domain, then you areallowed to use it—to copy it, to manipulate it and to distribute it. Works identified as Creative Commons allow varying degrees of use. In this case, the authors decide how you can use their images. No matter the author's decision, however, you must cite the origin.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.carfac.ca">CARFAC</a> (Canadian Artists Representation / Le front des artists canadiens)</li><li><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a href="https://images.google.com">Google Images</a>, and Flickr have databases of digital files that are available for use. You need to check the conditions of use as they vary: restrict your searches to files that are tagged as available for reuse.</li><li>The <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/Index.html">Copyright Act in Canada</a> provides information for navigating the current digital landscape. Please look especially at “Exceptions” in Part III.</li><li><a href="https://guides.library.cornell.edu/c.php?g=32593&amp;p=6241628">This document from Cornell University</a> helps define works in the public domain according to U.S. copyright.</li></ul><h3>Working in Teams</h3><p>The syllabus specifies both individual and group assignments. Each student must complete individual assignments independently. Collaboration on producing individual deliverables (i.e., autoethnographies, feedback on other projects) constitutes unauthorized collaboration as outlined in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71.</a> </p><p>You are responsible for signing yourself up to teams for group deliverables. Failure to do so by the indicated sign-up deadlines will result in a 20% reduction in the mark you receive for your deliverable mark. <br/> <br/>Group assignments must be completed collaboratively, including effectively managing goals, tasks, and workflow, completing deliverables on time and schedule, managing change and learning from mistakes, and engaging in healthy conflict. Each team member is expected to make tangible contributions to the project, drawing from their expertise and/or developing new skills and expertise. These contributions will be assessed in an evaluation for each group assignment; a written contribution response is required in the appendix of each group assignment. More details on this will be available in the individual assignment outlines.  </p><p>For the group assignments, each team member will receive the same “basis” for their grade on the report. At the same time, the instructor can adjust individual contributions, or lack thereof, based on the feedback from the peer review quiz. This means you must directly contribute to the project's development and make your team work effectively. </p><p>Also, during the semester, as soon as you perceive that a member consistently does not make a fair contribution to the team, <strong>you are responsible for communicating this to the instructor to resolve such issues as soon as possible and not wait until late in the term or after a deliverable has been submitted</strong>. When you contact the instructor, please include any additional work you had to complete on behalf of your group member, along with proof that you at least attempted to reach out to your group member and waited a reasonable amount of time for a response.  </p><h4>What Happens If I am Accused of Not Contributing to Team Deliverables?</h4><p>If the instructor finds that no team member has approached the non-contributing student to encourage them to contribute, this policy does not apply, and there are no penalties.  </p><p>When there is deemed a lack of contribution from one or more of the group members, the grade of the deliverable does not increase for the other team members who did contribute to the final submission. The deliverable is graded initially without considering the lack of contribution to have a baseline grade that the deliverable has earned. At this point, the quality of the deliverable does not increase because of the lack of contribution issues. This means the baseline grade is the highest grade the deliverable has earned, and therefore, that is the highest grade that can be offered to a student on the team that submitted the deliverable.  </p><p>The following penalty guidelines will be used to examine and categorize each lack of contribution case: </p><ul><li><strong>No penalty:</strong> To the best of their ability, the group members meet the deadlines and expectations agreed upon in the group charter.</li><li><strong>10% penalty*: </strong>One or more group members have attempted to reach out to the student and have not engaged or communicated with the group within a reasonable amount of time. The work submitted by the student was given to the group in a reasonable amount of time, but it was not as the group deemed acceptable and needed to be redone mostly.</li><li><strong>25% penalty*</strong>: If the student contributed at least half of their expected work, but not all content, in a reasonable amount of time, it was not as the group deemed acceptable and needed to be mostly re-done. This assumes one or more group members have attempted to reach out to the student to engage.</li><li><strong>50% penalty*:</strong> If the student contributed less than half of their expected work in a reasonable amount of time, it was not as the group deemed acceptable and needed to be mostly re-done. This assumes one or more group members have attempted to reach out to the student to engage.</li><li><strong>100% penalty*:</strong> If the student did not contribute any work of their own in a reasonable amount of time and/or if the work was stolen, bought, or used from a different course. If a student did not contribute any work, this is considered an academic offence, and an investigation into the project will be conducted.</li></ul><p><strong>*</strong> % penalty applied to the graded portion of the deliverable. For example, if a 10% penalty was applied and the student earned 60 points out of 100 and the 10% penalty was applied, the student would have a 6-point reduction based on the 10% of the 60 points earned.  </p><h4>Attendance and Participation Policy</h4><p><strong>Attendance: </strong>Successful completion of the course relies on consistent weekly participation, in class. Students are expected to attend class each week (3 hours) and allocate additional time for gathering materials and ensure proper preparation. Students are expected to attend their registered section and be on time consistently.   </p><p><strong>Participation: </strong><i>Participation depends upon presence:</i> you must attend class in order to participate. You are expected to come to class prepared. Read materials beforehand and offer good observations on them. Final marks are commensurate with the work you put in. If, on the other hand, you are found to be disruptive (for example, by talking amongst yourselves or working on other class projects), you may be asked to leave. </p><p><strong>Workload: </strong>Students are expected consult their weekly schedule to ensure they are ready to work at the start of the class time. Total time commitment for this course varies weekly but should be on average 6-7 hours per week. This number will be less on non-assignment weeks, but more when deliverables need additional focus on work. </p><p><strong>Missing class:</strong> Students are responsible for knowing the material and announcements presented during class whether or not you attend class. Please arrange with another student to get missed notes or announcements. An excellent way to get in touch with fellow students is on <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home/1103245">LEARN</a> or on <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3AYha0uI9q9VtcPaFGxUptnmAkOfgfLQsnQfNhlZMw2MA1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=a45f486f-a1b6-421b-bb05-59b12e6ad9c5&amp;tenantId=723a5a87-f39a-4a22-9247-3fc240c01396">MS Teams</a>.  </p><p><strong>Chronic Absenteeism: </strong> Successful completion of this course relies on in-class activity that fosters a collaborative learning community. Expect that your final mark suffer from missing several classes. We do not offer ways to make up missed days. </p><h3>Academic Accommodations  </h3><p>As a student, you can seek accommodation for assignments missed due to circumstances beyond your control, such as illness or emergency. The instructor will not consider extensions unless a short-term absence or the submission and approval of a verification of illness or extenuating circumstance form is used. They will not accept any medical or official documentation and should not be alerted to details about the circumstances in which you are absent. For additional support, please contact GBDA advising at <a href="mailto:gbda.advising@uwaterloo.ca"><u>gbda.advising@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or the Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies. </p><h4>Verification of Illness   </h4><p>To request an accommodation for a missed assessment due to illness, you must obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services"><u>Verification of Illness Form</u></a> that a physician has filled out. Instructors will consider VIFs filled out and issued by the University of Waterloo's <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/"><u>Campus Wellness</u></a> Services (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services"><u>Health Services</u></a> and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services"><u>Counselling Services</u></a>).  The VIF is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not submit the VIF or other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel, but through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. After submitting the form within 24 hours, contact your instructor to make alternate arrangements for the presentation and/or assignments. If the approved VIF is for a group presentation, the group will be allowed to present at a later date of mutual convenience for the instructor and TA. </p><h4>Extenuating Circumstances </h4><p>Your absence might be due to other extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement). In that case, you must submit all documentation related to the absence (e.g., obituary) through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. The VIF is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to extenuating circumstances. Do not submit the VIF or other documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel, but through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. After submitting the form within 24 hours, contact your instructor to make alternate arrangements for the presentation and/or assignments. If the approved VIF is for a group presentation, the group will be allowed to present at a later date of mutual convenience for the instructor and TA. </p><h4>Self-Declared Absences and Group Projects</h4><p>You can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students"><u>self-declare</u></a> an absence on Quest for pandemic-related reasons or short-term reasons.  </p><p><strong>Short-term absence:</strong> up to 48 hours, no documentation required, not retroactive, and a maximum of one per term during the formal lecture period.  </p><p><strong>Pandemic-related absence:</strong> you are not permitted to be involved in in-person course activity. No documentation is required. Similar to short-term absence, the group member can either participate in the presentation remotely or present their portion of the assignment separately with the instructor after the isolation period.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences and group projects.</strong> While self-declared absences are permitted, it is inadvisable to use them for group presentations. <i>Self-declared absences apply only to the individual and do not extend deadlines or provide accommodations for the group.</i> Given the collaborative nature of the course and the logistical challenges of rescheduling group presentations, it is nearly impossible to present the project without all group members present. Students are encouraged to communicate with their group and the instructor well in advance if they foresee any challenges in meeting presentation deadlines. </p><p><strong>If a self-declared absence is unavoidable for a group project.</strong> If a group member anticipates using their self-declared absences during a presentation week, they must notify the instructor and their group members in advance. While your absence is excused, the other group members will still be responsible for completing their assigned presentation portion as outlined in the group charter. The remaining group members will be responsible for delivering their sections and potentially adapting the presentation to accommodate your absence. The absent group member will be required to complete their part of the presentation separately with the instructor within 48 hours after the class's scheduled presentation time, or they will receive a 0. </p><h3>Intellectual Property</h3><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience.

Missing the entire class will result in a <i>0 for participation</i> that day. </p><p><i><strong>Off-Campus Interviews: </strong></i>If your interview requires you to travel to a location different from the Stratford campus, you must request a <i>location accommodation</i> by submitting the <i>Interview Conflict Form</i> via WaterlooWorks. </p><p><i><strong>Interviews During Presentations:</strong> </i>For interviews that conflict with a scheduled presentation, you must submit the <i>Interview Conflict Form</i> on WaterlooWorks as soon as possible to explore accommodations. <i>You will receive a 0 for the assignment if you do not present</i>. </p><p><i><strong>Scheduling Interviews:</strong> </i>Once you are selected for an interview, log in to WaterlooWorks immediately to choose a time that minimizes conflicts with your course schedule. As a student participating in remote interviews from the Stratford Campus, you are typically scheduled toward the end of the employer's interview day. </p><p>For more information on handling interview conflicts, visit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts">Co-op Interview Conflicts</a>. </p><h3>Media Services</h3><p>Media Services is the Stratford School’s technical equipment library.
