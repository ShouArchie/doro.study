<h4>Terry's Course Description</h4><p>Design is a verb—it’s something you <i>do</i>. <i>How to be a Designer </i>is a hands-on, project-based studio course that will prepare you for a life in the design world. We will be making things, <i>not things about things. </i>To get ready for launch—you, the emerging designer needs to figure out what kind of designer you are. It’s fourth year. Time to turn pro.</p>

<h4>Projects—The Heart of a Studio Course— 2 Small, 1 Medium, 1 Large</h4><p>All your questions are answered in the Project Descriptions on Learn in the ‘contents’ section.</p><p><strong>Project 1: </strong><i><strong>What’s Your Story? — </strong></i><strong>The Short Project.</strong> Working with a partner, you will create a portrait/story <i>of them</i> <i>as an Emerging Creative</i> based on an in-class interview. You will interview them about their design/creative practice and communicate their story in a creative manner. Think of “portrait” in the most expansive way—it’s not an essay, it’s not a painting, it’s a STORY about them as a creative— a combo of text and imagery that communicates their story. It could be a series of posters/infographics/magazine article/illustration/comic — the genre is up to you.</p><p><strong>Project 2: </strong><i><strong>PSA—Public Service Announcement</strong></i><strong> — The BIG Project. </strong>As a Designer you will be communicating with the world. So, what do you want to say? Say it with a <strong>GIANT PSA</strong>. It could be your design motto or philosophy, a statement about who YOU are as a designer, an illustration of you as a designer, an illustration of your style, the theme &amp; subject is up to you. It should be your DESIGN statement to the world! It may be a design motto, a manifesto, 10 rules for design. It might be about the topic you are passionate about such as justice or sustainability or accessibility. It might be about imposter syndrome, advice for an emerging designer or encouragement to future designers. Imagine you’re in an interview in 3 months and you’re asked what your design philosophy is—that is your PSA.</p><p><strong>Project 3: </strong><i><strong>Dang, I Wish I Made That!</strong></i><strong> aka DIMWIT /dim-whit/ — The MEDIUM Project. </strong>Have you ever come across a designed ‘thing’ or ‘experience’ and thought with a twinge of envy ‘Dang, I wish I’d made that’? Well, now’s your chance! As a designer you must constantly refine your sense of taste and style—to do that as a student designer you need to look to the work of others for inspiration. The word ‘derivative’ sometimes gets a bad rap, but with this project I want you to consider it as an homage. Think of how artists &amp; designers used to copy each other as a way to learn from the pros. This is a chance to unpack what really inspires you to MAKE! Show us what drives you to create!</p><p><strong>Project 4: Where you going? aka WYG! (whoo-gaa) Another Short Project. </strong>The job scene is tough. You’re going to need to communicate the story of you as an emerging designer (or whatever you wish to become). To do this you will write a bio of yourself as a designer. You will write a LONG and SHORT bio using the techniques of storytelling.</p><h4>Deadlines</h4><ul><li>Project 1 due Tuesday January 13<sup>th</sup> in class</li><li>Project 2 Part 1 Pitch Presentation Due January 26<sup>th</sup> at midnight</li><li>Project 2 Part 2 Installation February 24<sup>th</sup> in class</li><li>Project 3 Part 1 due Sunday March 9<sup>th</sup> at midnight</li><li>Project 3 Part 2 due Sunday March 23<sup>rd</sup> at midnight</li><li>Project 4 due Monday March 31<sup>st</sup> in class</li></ul><h4>Grading Rubric</h4><p>Your work will be graded on the following criteria:</p><ol><li><strong>Communication</strong></li><li><strong>Demonstration of Technical Skills</strong></li><li><strong>Creativity &amp; Experimentation</strong></li><li><strong>Effort and Participation</strong></li></ol><p> </p><p> </p>

However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

Your chosen or preferred first name listed in WatIAM will be used across campus (e.g., in LEARN, Quest, WaterlooWorks, WatCard, etc).

If no pronoun is added, the field in Quest will remain blank. The University is working to provide your pronouns to other systems across campus (e.g., LEARN, WaterlooWorks).</p><h4>Scent in the Classroom Policy </h4><p>The University of Waterloo recognizes that exposure to scented products can adversely affect individuals' health, leading to rashes, severe headaches, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. These reactions can occur even at low levels of exposure. The university advises students, employees, and visitors to avoid using scented products indoors to promote a healthy environment. </p><p>Students should refrain from wearing or bringing strongly scented products into the classroom as sensitive individuals may have severe reactions to even minor scents. Failure to comply with this policy will result in being asked to leave the classroom, thereby missing in-class activities and lectures for that day. </p><p>Please ensure that any food you bring into the classroom has no strong scent. Additionally, be mindful of classmates' allergies to avoid triggering adverse reactions. </p><p>By adhering to this scent-free policy, we contribute to a healthier and more inclusive environment for everyone.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>.
