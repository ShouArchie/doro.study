  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4><strong>Course and Department Policies</strong></h4><p>Communication: The course instructor, Professor Kim de Laat, will have office hours on Thursdays from 11-12 and 3-4 pm EST in #2129, and by appointment, and checks e-mails regularly. Please ensure that you include the course code in the subject line of your email.</p><p>All e-mail communication sent from students to instructors must originate from the student’s own UWaterloo e-mail account. This policy protects confidentiality and confirms the identity of the student. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that communication is sent to the university from an UWaterloo account. If an instructor or client becomes aware that a communication has come from an alternate address, the instructor may not reply at his or her discretion.</p><p>Late Work: A 5% penalty per day will apply, and no component of the assignment will be accepted after 5 days past the due date. This applies to both individual and group assignments. With COVID-19 (and life in general), personal matters can always change plans: if something unforeseen happens, please don’t hesitate to contact Kim de Laat and work out an alternative. Additionally, please refer to the policy on “Accommodation for Students with Disabilities”.</p><p>Please be reminded that you can declare a short-term absence once per semester. More information can be found here:<strong> </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences"><strong>https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences</strong></a></p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><p> </p><h4><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement</strong></h4><p>The Faculty of Arts acknowledges that we are living and working on the traditional territory of the Attawandaron (also known as Neutral), Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes ten kilometres on each side of the Grand River. The Stratford School of Interaction Design and Business is situated on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, and the Ojibway/Chippewa peoples. This territory is covered by the Upper Canada Treaties.</p><p> </p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations"><u>accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</u></a> under the<u> </u>Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i><u>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</u></i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  </p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website</a> </p><h4>Declaring Absences</h4><p>For all of the following categories of absence students are responsible for getting in touch with their course instructors as soon as possible to discuss possible accommodations for the missed course component(s). The course instructor will determine how the missed work is accommodated. Absences will be accommodated according to the<a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations"> academic regulations section of the undergraduate calendar</a>. </p><p>f you are unable to complete a course component due to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#public-health"><u>self-declared COVID-related reasons</u></a> or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences"><u>a two-day short-term absence</u></a> then you should submit a self-declaration of absence through <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students"><u>Quest</u></a>.  </p><p>If your absence is due to an <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#VIF"><u>illness not pandemic-related</u></a>, then a<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#VIF"><u> UW Verification of Illness form,</u></a> completed by a health professional, must be uploaded and submitted through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other"><u>Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process.</u></a> The VIF is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not submit the VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  </p><p>If your absence is due to other <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other"><u>extenuating circumstances </u></a>(e.g., bereavement), then you must submit all documentation related to the absence (e.g., obituary) through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other"><u>Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</u></a>.  </p><p>Submission through the VIF or Extenuating Circumstances System, once approved, will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p>If your absence is due to a <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">religious or spiritual observance</a> please inform the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.

Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details.
