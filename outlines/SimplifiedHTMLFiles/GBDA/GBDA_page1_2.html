<p>There are no required texts for this course. Your instructor will provide recommended readings where appropriate, and you may feel free to ask for additional readings.   </p><p>We will use <strong>Adobe Creative Suite</strong> software in this course. The Creative Suite is unquestionably the industry standard. You can get a subscription at a <a href="https://wstore.uwaterloo.ca/search?q=adobe&amp;type=product&amp;product_cat=all"><u>student discount through the University's W Store</u></a>. Students may use other apps that have equivalent functionalities with instructor approval, but only Adobe Creative Suite apps will be demonstrated and supported.</p><p>Digital media assets, such as 4K video, require significantly more storage than typical computing tasks. To manage these files, you may need to borrow or purchase an external hard drive (USB-C, USB 3.0, or Thunderbolt compatible) with sufficient capacity.</p><p>This course will use a cross-section of design software applications included in the Adobe Creative Suite. While some use of these programs may be covered during lectures, time restraints prevent comprehensive software lessons. Students are strongly encouraged to attend technical tutorials given by Noah Pratt, as greater facility with these software packages leads to more confident content creation. The <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home/48169"><u>Stratford School Field Guide</u></a> is an excellent resource for equipment guides and more. Access to supplementary tutorials will be posted on LEARN. In addition, it is strongly recommended that you explore the courses supplied on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/"><u>LinkedIn Learning</u></a>; the University pays for a subscription for LIL, it's an excellent resource.

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Attendance and Participation Policy </h3><p>Attendance - Successful completion of the course relies on consistent weekly participation, in class. Students are expected to attend class each week (3 hours) and allocate additional time for gathering materials and ensure proper preparation. Students are expected to attend their registered section and be on time consistently.   </p><p>Workload – Students are expected to bring assigned materials to class and consult their weekly schedule to ensure they are ready to work at the start of the class time. Total time commitment for this course varies weekly but should be on average 6-7 hours per week. This will be less on non-assignment weeks but more on weeks where deliverables need additional focus on work. </p><p>Participation  <i>Participation depends upon presence:</i> you must attend class in order to participate. You are expected to come to class prepared. Read materials beforehand and be prepared to offer good observations on them. Final marks are commensurate with the work you put in. If, on the other hand, you are found to be disruptive (for example, by talking amongst yourselves or working on other class projects), you may be asked to leave. </p><p>Missing class – Students are responsible for knowing the material and announcements presented during class whether or not you attend class. Please arrange with another student to get missed notes or announcements. An excellent way to get in touch with fellow students is on Learn or on Teams.  </p><p>The midterm exam has been scheduled around the expected “busy” times for Cycle 1 and 2 interview cycles however there may be a situation where a quiz may overlap with a job interview. Students are encouraged to schedule around assessment days but if a quiz overlaps then it will be the dropped item.  The missed quiz will not be rescheduled for interviews.  </p><p>Chronic Absenteeism – Successful completion of this course relies on in-class activity that fosters a collaborative learning community. Since most material for quizzes and tests come from in class content delivery activities, students striving for top grades should expect to attend a proportionate number of classes to reflect this.  </p><p> </p><h3><strong>Interviews for Co-op Policy</strong> </h3><p>Professors, faculty, instructors and teaching assistants are not required to accommodate co-op interview conflicts. If your <strong>Full-Cycle Service</strong> job board interview conflicts with a course requirement, you may use the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts"><u>interview conflict process</u></a> to determine the best course of action. </p><p> </p><p>In this course, the following guidelines apply: </p><p> </p><p><strong>Regular Classes (Non-Presentation Days):</strong> </p><p>You may leave class for your interview but are expected to attend around the interview time. </p><p>Missing the entire class will result in a <strong>0 for participation</strong> that day. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Off-Campus Interviews:</strong> </p><p>If your interview requires you to travel to a location different from the Stratford campus, you must request a <strong>location accommodation</strong> by submitting the <strong>Interview Conflict Form</strong> via WaterlooWorks. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Interviews during Presentations:</strong> </p><p>For interviews that conflict with a scheduled presentation, you must submit the <strong>Interview Conflict Form</strong> on WaterlooWorks as soon as possible to explore accommodations. You will receive a 0 on the assignment if you miss the presentation. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Scheduling Interviews:</strong> </p><p>Once you are selected for an interview, log in to WaterlooWorks immediately to choose a time that minimizes conflicts with your course schedule. </p><p>For more information on handling interview conflicts, visit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts"><u>Co-op Interview Conflicts</u></a>." </p><p> </p><h3>Scent in the Classroom Policy </h3><p>The University of Waterloo recognizes that exposure to scented products can adversely affect individuals' health, leading to rashes, severe headaches, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. These reactions can occur even at low levels of exposure. The university advises students, employees, and visitors to avoid using scented products indoors to promote a healthy environment. </p><p>Scented products include, but are not limited to: </p><p>Perfumes and colognes </p><p>Aftershaves </p><p>Essential oils </p><p>Scented lotions </p><p>Hair sprays and other hair products </p><p>Scented deodorants </p><p>Fragranced cosmetics </p><p>Laundry detergents and fabric softeners with added fragrances </p><p>Air fresheners and scented candles </p><p>Students should refrain from wearing or bringing strongly scented products into the classroom as sensitive individuals may have severe reactions to even minor scents. Failure to comply with this policy will result in being asked to leave the classroom, thereby missing in-class activities and lectures for that day. </p><p>Please ensure that any food you bring into the classroom has no strong scent. Additionally, be mindful of classmates' allergies to avoid triggering adverse reactions. </p><p>By adhering to this scent-free policy, we contribute to a healthier and more inclusive environment for everyone." </p><p>Grading Policy </p><p>This course recognizes the importance of timely feedback and transparency in the evaluation process. We have provided comprehensive rubrics for each assignment and will promptly give feedback.  </p><p>Turnaround Time: We aim to release grades approximately two weeks after a crit or the final submission of an assignment. Kindly refrain from inquiring about grades before the designated two-week timeframe for release. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to provide you with feedback within the specified timeframe.  </p><p>Communication: Please carefully review the rubric and comments provided with your grades. Should you have any questions or require clarification regarding your grade, please direct inquiries as a message on Teams to the respective instructor or TA responsible for marking your assignment.  </p><p>Regrade requests: If you find the need for a regrade or seek clarification on your grade, you have a two-week window from the date of grade release to submit your request. It's important to note that regrades will involve a reassessment of the entire assignment rather than specific sections. Consequently, your overall mark may either increase or decrease.  </p><p> </p><h3>Grading Assessment </h3><p>What Does My Grade Mean? </p><p><strong>A+ (90–100)</strong>: This mark is for exceptional work that demonstrates a profound understanding of the issues presented in class. <i>It indicates work that is well above average for GBDA students</i>. The work demonstrates a professional level of involvement and execution on the part of the student, and stands on its own terms outside of the context of a school assignment. </p><p><strong>A (80-89): </strong>This mark is for exceptional work that, to varying degrees, demonstrates a thorough understanding of the issues presented in class. <i>It indicates work that is above average for GBDA students.</i> The work demonstrates a deep involvement on the part of the student, and could stand on its own terms outside of the context of a school assignment. </p><p><strong>B (70-79):</strong> This mark is for notable work that, to varying degrees, shows that the student has understood the topic and has made every effort to fulfil the requirements of the assignment to the best of his or her ability. <i>It indicates work of the expected quality for GBDA students, and represents good work</i>. </p><p><strong>C (60- 69):</strong> This mark is for satisfactory/acceptable work, to varying degrees: for example, it may be successful on one level, but fails on another. Alternately, the work may reflect a good deal of effort, but it does not adequately address the topic at hand. <i>It is not quite up to GBDA standards</i>, but not that far away, either. After having followed recommendations by the lecturer, future work should do meet GBDA standards. </p><p><strong>D (50-59):</strong> This mark is for barely adequate work, to varying degrees: the work displays minimal effort and commitment on the part of the student and/or does not convey a sufficient understanding of the topic at hand. <i>It is below GBDA standards</i>, and significantly more effort would be required to meet those standards.  </p><p><strong>F (33-49): </strong>This mark is for insufficient or incomplete work, to varying degrees, and is marked as a fail. <i>It indicates work that is well below GBDA standards</i>, and future work would require substantial effort to meet standards. </p><p> </p><h3>Late Work </h3><p>All assignments are due by the deadlines indicated on LEARN. For A1 and side quests, late submissions are subject to a penalty of 5% per day, including weekends. Penalties will be deducted from the grade received. Missing a presentation without accessibility accommodations, verification of illness, or extenuating circumstances will result in a grade of 0 for that component. </p><p>While self-declared absences are permitted, their use for group presentations is highly discouraged. A self-declared absence applies only to the individual and does not extend deadlines or provide accommodations for the group. Given the collaborative nature of the course and the logistical challenges of rescheduling group presentations, it is nearly impossible to present the project without all group members present. Students are encouraged to communicate with their group and the instructor well in advance if they foresee any challenges in meeting presentation deadlines</p><p> </p><h3>Generative AI</h3><p><br/>Artificial intelligence—including generative AI (GenAI) forms such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney, or GitHub CoPilot—<i>may be used in this course</i> to produce text, images, music, or code. How<i>ever, you must employ with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement when using it</i>. </p><p><strong>Documentation:</strong> </p><p>You must explicitly state when and how you have used GenAI tools in your work. </p><p>Use the documentation template available on LEARN to outline your process and submit it with your assignments. </p><p>Permission to use AI in this course, and the requirement to document it, includes grammar or spelling corrections from AI tools, including programs like Grammarly. </p><p>Failure to document the use of GenAI will be considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><strong><u>Policy 71</u></strong></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aid/assistance). </p><p><strong>Language Restriction:</strong> </p><p>All AI use must be in <strong>English</strong> to ensure transparency and the ability to verify appropriate use. While AI tools may assist with grammar and spelling corrections, any translations from other languages into English must also be documented. </p><p><strong>Original Work and Integrity:</strong> </p><p>Work produced with uncredited assistance from AI tools does not represent the author’s original work. Submitting such work without proper acknowledgment violates academic integrity policies. </p><p>There are limits to the use of AI in this course. Running course materials through GenAI, using GenAI to complete assessments, or translating a text without credit is prohibited and will be treated as an academic offence. </p><p><strong>Recommendations for Citing GenAI:</strong> </p><p>Follow the citation guidelines from the <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>University of Waterloo Library: Generative AI Citation Guide</u></a>. </p><p>Be aware that GenAI can falsify references, fabricate facts, or express ideas inaccurately. Use caution and verify the output for accuracy. </p><p><strong>Legal and Copyright Considerations:</strong> </p><p>The copyright status of GenAI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using substantial portions of AI-generated content, especially images. Consult the Copyright Advisory Committee’s guidelines for more information: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">Copyright and Generative AI</a>. </p><p><strong>Student Responsibility:</strong> </p><p>You are responsible for all work submitted in this class, including assignments and presentations incorporating GenAI tools. Any AI usage must: </p><p>Be explicitly stated within your submission. </p><p>Include the documentation template detailing the GenAI tool, purpose, and outputs. </p><p> </p><h3>Working in Teams </h3><p>The syllabus specifies both individual and group assignments. Each student must complete individual assignments independently. Collaboration on producing individual deliverables (i.e., Side Quests) constitutes unauthorized collaboration as outlined in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71.</a> <br/> <br/>Group assignments must be completed collaboratively, including effectively managing goals, tasks, and workflow, completing deliverables on time and schedule, managing change and learning from mistakes, and engaging in healthy conflict. Each team member is expected to make tangible contributions to the project, drawing from their expertise and/or developing new skills and expertise. These contributions will be assessed in an evaluation for each group assignment; a written contribution response is required in the appendix of each group assignment. More details on this will be available in the individual assignment outlines.  </p><p>For the group assignments, each team member will receive the same “basis” for their grade on the report. At the same time, the instructor can adjust individual contributions, or lack thereof, based on the feedback from the peer review quiz. This means you must directly contribute to the project's development and make your team work effectively. </p><p>Also, during the semester, as soon as you perceive that a member consistently does not make a fair contribution to the team, you are responsible for communicating this to the instructor to resolve such issues <strong>as soon as possible</strong> and not wait until late in the term or after a deliverable has been submitted. When you contact the instructor, please include any additional work you had to complete on behalf of your group member, along with proof that you at least attempted to reach out to your group member and waited a reasonable amount of time for a response.  </p><p>If the instructor finds that no team member has approached the non-contributing student to encourage them to contribute, this policy does not apply, and there are no penalties.  </p><p>When there is deemed a lack of contribution from one or more of the group members, the grade of the deliverable does not increase for the other team members who did contribute to the final submission. The deliverable is graded initially without considering the lack of contribution to have a baseline grade that the deliverable has earned. At this point, the quality of the deliverable does not increase because of the lack of contribution issues. This means the baseline grade is the highest grade the deliverable has earned, and therefore, that is the highest grade that can be offered to a student on the team that submitted the deliverable.  </p><p>The following penalty guidelines will be used to examine and categorize each lack of contribution case: </p><p>No penalty: To the best of their ability, the group members meet the deadlines and expectations agreed upon in the group charter.  </p><p>10% penalty*: One or more group members have attempted to reach out to the student and have not engaged or communicated with the group within a reasonable amount of time. The work submitted by the student was given to the group in a reasonable amount of time, but it was not as the group deemed acceptable and needed to be redone mostly.  </p><p>25% penalty*: If the student contributed at least half of their expected work, but not all content, in a reasonable amount of time, it was not as the group deemed acceptable and needed to be mostly re-done. This assumes one or more group members have attempted to reach out to the student to engage.  </p><p>50% penalty*: If the student contributed less than half of their expected work in a reasonable amount of time, it was not as the group deemed acceptable and needed to be mostly re-done. This assumes one or more group members have attempted to reach out to the student to engage.  </p><p>100% penalty*: If the student did not contribute any work of their own in a reasonable amount of time and/or if the work was stolen, bought, or used from a different course. If a student did not contribute any work, this is considered an academic offence, and an investigation into the project will be conducted.  </p><p>* % penalty applied to the graded portion of the deliverable. For example, if a 10% penalty was applied and the student earned 60 points out of 100 and the 10% penalty was applied, the student would have a 6-point reduction based on the 10% of the 60 points earned.  </p><h3>Electronic Device Policy </h3><p>This course uses electronic devices (laptops, and we will use programs in the class, such as p5.ja and Teams. Please do not access unrelated materials during class time. Presentation slides, links, and extra materials will be provided following each class.  </p><p>You are welcome to use any assistive technology in the classroom. If you need any support or modifications due to your disability in course activities, please let the instructor know by the second week of class. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policies/policy-58-accessibility">Policy 58</a>.  </p><h3>Instructor Contact </h3><p>The instructor is available to answer questions outside of class. However, they have other responsibilities and will sometimes be unavailable for support. Please post any general questions you have on our Discussion forum, and the instructor, a TA, or even another student can answer. If you have any personal questions, you can email your instructor. </p><h3>Academic Offences </h3><p>If a student is suspected of engaging in unauthorized collaboration, plagiarism, unauthorized aid or assistance, misrepresentation, copying of one's work from another class assessment, or theft of intellectual property, they will be reported by the instructor to the Associate Dean of Arts. </p><p>When grades are released, the student will receive a comment on the ungraded assignment stating concerns about an academic offence and that they are being investigated. No other information will be able to be released to the student until the investigation is complete. </p><p>For group work, you must identify the portions of the assignment you were responsible for on the peer review quiz. If there are concerns about plagiarism and identification is absent, all students in the group will be held responsible for violations of academic integrity in the group submission.  </p><p>Once the investigation is complete, if no academic offence is found, the student or group will receive their grade as normal. However, if there is an academic office, the student or group will receive an email from the instructor or the Associate Dean of Arts office indicating concerns about plagiarism.  </p><p>The severity of the penalty for plagiarism depends on the quantity of plagiarized content and the extent to which the student failed to attribute the plagiarized materials. The impact of the penalty also depends on the value of the submission. Extenuating circumstances are sometimes considered case-by-case, and sometimes less severe penalties are considered. Repeat offenders will receive more severe penalties.  </p><p>If your assignment is flagged for plagiarism, you have two choices: accept the allegation and penalty. Then, you will receive an official resolution letter from the Associate Dean. You can request a formal investigation to dispute the allegation and penalty. If so, you will meet directly with the Associate Dean to discuss your objections and relevant evidence.  </p><p>Read<strong> </strong>the University of Waterloo <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70"><u>Policy 70 </u></a>(Student petitions and grievances), <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (Student discipline), and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72"><u>Policy 72</u></a> (Student appeals), and they will provide you with information regarding the procedures that will take place. </p><h3>Academic Accommodations  </h3><p>As a student, you can seek accommodation for assignments missed due to circumstances beyond your control, such as illness or emergency. The instructor will not consider extensions unless a short-term absence or the submission and approval of a verification of illness or extenuating circumstance form is used. They will not accept any medical or official documentation and should not be alerted to details about the circumstances in which you are absent. For additional support, please contact GBDA advising at <a href="mailto:gbda.advising@uwaterloo.ca"><u>gbda.advising@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or the Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies. </p><p>Verification of Illness   </p><p>To request an accommodation for a missed assessment due to illness, you must obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services"><u>Verification of Illness Form</u></a> that a physician has filled out. Instructors will consider VIFs filled out and issued by the University of Waterloo's <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/"><u>Campus Wellness</u></a> Services (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services"><u>Health Services</u></a> and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services"><u>Counselling Services</u></a>).  The VIF is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not submit the VIF or other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel, but through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. After submitting the form within 24 hours, contact your instructor to make alternate arrangements for the presentation and/or assignments. If the approved VIF is for a group presentation, the group will be allowed to present at a later date of mutual convenience for the instructor and TA. </p><p>Extenuating Circumstances </p><p>Suppose your absence is due to other extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement). In that case, you must submit all documentation related to the absence (e.g., obituary) through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. The VIF is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to extenuating circumstances. Do not submit the VIF or other documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel, but through the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. After submitting the form within 24 hours, contact your instructor to make alternate arrangements for the presentation and/or assignments. If the approved VIF is for a group presentation, the group will be allowed to present at a later date of mutual convenience for the instructor and TA. </p><p>Self-Declared Absences  </p><p>You can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students"><u>self-declare</u></a> an absence on Quest for pandemic-related reasons or short-term reasons:  </p><p><strong>Short-term absence: </strong>up to 48 hours, no documentation required, not retroactive, and a maximum of one per term during the formal lecture period.  </p><p>If a group member anticipates using their self-declared absences during a presentation week, they must notify the instructor and their group members in advance. While your absence is excused, the other group members will still be responsible for completing their assigned presentation portion as outlined in the group charter. The remaining group members will be responsible for delivering their sections and potentially adapting the presentation to accommodate your absence. The absent group member will be required to complete their part of the presentation separately with the instructor within 48 hours after the class's scheduled presentation time, or they will receive a 0. </p><p><strong>Pandemic-related absence</strong>: no in-person course activity is permitted. No documentation is required. Similar to short-term absence, the group member can either participate in the presentation remotely or present their portion of the assignment separately with the instructor after the isolation period.  </p><p><strong>False claims:</strong> Self-declared absences are automatically false claims that constitute an academic offence that will result in disciplinary action under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71 (Student Discipline)</u></a>.  </p><p>Co-Op Interview Conflicts </p><p>We are not required to accommodate co-op interview conflicts; however, the following guidelines apply: </p><p><strong>Regular Classes (Non-Presentation Days):</strong> </p><p>You may leave class for your interview but are expected to attend around the interview time. </p><p>Missing the entire class will result in a <strong>0 for participation</strong> that day. </p><p><strong>Off-Campus Interviews:</strong> </p><p>If your interview requires you to travel to a location different from the Stratford campus, you must request a <strong>location accommodation</strong> by submitting the <strong>Interview Conflict Form</strong> via WaterlooWorks. </p><p><strong>Interviews during Presentations:</strong> </p><p>For interviews that conflict with a scheduled presentation, you must submit the <strong>Interview Conflict Form</strong> on WaterlooWorks as soon as possible to explore accommodations. You will receive a 0 on the assignment if you miss the presentation. </p><p><strong>Scheduling Interviews:</strong> </p><p>Once you are selected for an interview, log in to WaterlooWorks immediately to choose a time that minimizes conflicts with your course schedule. </p><p>As a student participating in remote interviews from the Stratford Campus, you are typically scheduled toward the end of the employer's interview day. </p><p>For more information on handling interview conflicts, visit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts">Co-op Interview Conflicts</a>. </p><p>Academic Freedom at the University of Waterloo </p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a>, states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries the duty to use that freedom consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment that fosters free debate may occasionally include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with openly, respectfully and sensitively.” This definition is repeated in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policies 70</a> and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">71</a> and the <a href="https://outline.uwaterloo.ca/view/Memorandum%20of%20Agreement,%20Section%206">Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</a>.  </p><p>Anti-Colonialism, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (AD-EDI)  </p><p>The Stratford School of Interaction Design and Business considers anti-racism, decolonization, equity, diversity, and inclusion (AD-EDI) essential to our collective responsibility as a community. As part of our commitment to academic excellence, we address systemic racism, discrimination, and bias within our classrooms, disciplines, and communities. We are committed to creating inclusive environments that centre the perspectives, voices, and experiences of individuals from equity-deserving groups, including, but not limited to: Black and Indigenous individuals; people of colour; women-identified, non-binary, agender, and gender-nonconforming individuals; 2SLGBTQ+ individuals; persons with disabilities; and people from other racialized, marginalized, and underrepresented communities. We see it as a shared responsibility to learn, support, and implement evidence-based best practices that uphold the values of AD-EDI.   </p><p>Scent Policy </p><p>The University of Waterloo recognizes that exposure to scented products can adversely affect individuals' health, leading to rashes, severe headaches, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. These reactions can occur even at low levels of exposure. The university advises students, employees, and visitors to avoid using scented products indoors to promote a healthy environment. </p><p>Scented products include, but are not limited to: </p><p>Perfumes and colognes </p><p>Aftershaves </p><p>Essential oils </p><p>Scented lotions </p><p>Hair sprays and other hair products </p><p>Scented deodorants </p><p>Fragranced cosmetics </p><p>Laundry detergents and fabric softeners with added fragrances </p><p>Air fresheners and scented candles </p><p>Students should refrain from wearing or bringing strongly scented products into the classroom due to the instructor's severe reactions to even minor scents. Failure to comply with this policy will result in being asked to leave the classroom, thereby missing in-class activities and lectures for that day. </p><p>Please ensure that any food you bring into the classroom has no strong scent. Additionally, be mindful of classmates' allergies to avoid triggering adverse reactions. </p><p>By adhering to this scent-free policy, we contribute to a healthier and more inclusive environment for everyone. </p><p>Chosen/Preferred Name  </p><p>Do you want professors and staff to call you by a different first name?

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.
