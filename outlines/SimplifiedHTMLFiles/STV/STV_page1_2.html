  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>STV 100:</div>
<p>This course examines the interaction of the technologies developed by a culture with the values and social organization of that culture. The course exposes students to various definitions of society, technology and values, and it presents alternative views about how the three interact. These views are then applied to a number of spheres of influence, including patterns of employment and the role of work; medicine and health; polity and economy; sustainable development and the environment.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>STV 100 is a course about how people (including you!) think about technology and society. It’s open to all students, and draws on many disciplines, including history, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and more. In the end, the goal is to improve your critical thinking abilities, particularly when it comes to technology and how it interacts with society and values.</p><p>This is a “flipped” course. That means <strong>before</strong> most classes there are short video lectures, readings, and a quiz which are all <strong>required</strong>. This way, we can use the in-class lecture time for active learning, group activities, and discussions.</p>

<h3>STV 100 materials</h3><p>All readings are provided on LEARN, or via the UW Library. Except for required supplies noted below, all course material is provided.  </p><h3>Supplies and laptop recommendations</h3><h4>Required supplies</h4><ul><li>Basic stationery supplies (pens, pencils, ruler, paper, etc.).</li><li>An electronic device (or devices), such as a cellphone, that can:<ul><li>Authenticate on <a href="https://uwaterloo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ISTKB/pages/44253806657/Enroll+using+mobile+phone+number">Duo</a>.</li><li>Browse the internet (for example, to enable participation in live polling during class).</li><li>Capture images of written work (for submission to electronic dropboxes).</li></ul></li></ul><p>See below for additional program-specific requirements.</p><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li>You will need access to a computer. While UW generally provides computer laboratories and terminal servers that meet this need, most students obtain their own. See below for some guidance.</li><li>Many students take notes using a tablet and stylus. Choice of device is personal preference.</li></ul><h3>Laptop recommendations</h3><p>A new laptop should:</p><ul><li>Be light enough to carry regularly.</li><li>Have a hinge that is going to last for years - avoid plastic cases.</li><li>Have a battery life that will last a long time.  Several brands have a 10 to 12-hour battery life now. You will spend long hours at university, and you may want to carry a charger around with you, but there are not a lot of places to plug in.</li><li>A minimum of 8GB of RAM will suffice for existing laptops. If you are purchasing new, then we recommend 16GB RAM - as this will become necessary within the lifetime of a laptop.</li><li>For storage, we recommended an SSD drive with at least 240 GB. Note that you will have 5 TB of OneDrive space in the cloud from your @uwaterloo.ca Microsoft 365 account, but remember that this requires a connection to a network.</li></ul><p> </p>

<h3>Pre-Knowledge Surveys</h3><p><strong>There are 11 pre-knowledge surveys.</strong> The purpose is to gather student perspectives, which helps spark in-class discussions and analysis. There are no right or wrong answers. You get credit for submitting almost anything, aside from jokes or something inappropriate. They are not anonymous.</p><p>Your grade is proportional to the number of complete surveys. So 11 surveys across 5% means each is worth approximately 0.45%.</p><p><strong>The deadline is always 9am on Friday</strong>. No late submissions are permitted, and if you forget there are no extensions or alternatives.</p><p>Unfortunately, LEARN's “Survey” feature does not work well for an activity that corresponds to a grade credit, so look under Quizzes or follow the link in the module folder.</p><h3>Module Quizzes</h3><p><strong>There are eight quizzes, based on pre-class study material.</strong> These are low-stakes and have two goals: so you can test your understanding of the material, and to encourage everyone to be ready for group activities in-class.</p><p><strong>Quizzes are marked with <sup>*</sup> on the schedule, and the deadline is always 6pm.</strong></p><p><strong>Each quiz is multiple choice and graded automatically, with questions drawn randomly from a pool.</strong> You can choose when to complete the quiz, but there is a 25-minute time limit once you begin. No late quiz submissions are possible.</p><p><strong>Your single lowest quiz grade will be automatically dropped.</strong> Seven quiz grades count across 10% so each quiz is worth around 1.43%.</p><p><strong>The quizzes are open book</strong>. That is, during the quiz you may review your notes, the lectures, and any materials I posted to LEARN. You may not communicate directly or indirectly with anyone else, except the instructor or TAs, or share any quiz questions or answers. By starting a quiz, you agree to honour these terms.</p><p>These are not complicated or difficult quizzes, <strong>if you review the study material ahead time and take notes.</strong> Pay heed: many students have told me that taking notes while studying was key to doing well on the quizzes and the in-class exercises.</p><h3>In-class Engagement</h3><p>During the lecture slot, students will work in groups on multiple activities. Groups are small (3-4 students) and you can choose your own group. The activities allow you to practice with concepts and prepare you for assignments.</p><p><strong>Each group submits a summary of their discussion before leaving for the night</strong>, and each student in the group will share the grade.</p><p>There are twelve engagement opportunities, one per week. All weigh the same, and <strong>the lowest single grade is automatically dropped</strong>. The top eleven count, so each is worth about 3.2%.</p><p><strong>No remote participation is permitted.</strong> If you can’t attend, your grade is zero. If you provide Verification of Illness or self-declare an absence, the grade will be exempted from the final calculation.</p><p><strong>Complete attendance is required.</strong> All group members must be present for the entire engagement activity for full credit. If you can only attend for some of the activity, speak to the instructor to arrange partial credit. Otherwise, leaving before it is complete, or arriving after it has begun, or adding the name of someone who is not present is <strong>misrepresentation</strong> and will lead to academic discipline for the entire group.</p><h3>Assignments</h3><p>There are two major assignments worth 17.5% each. See the schedule above. The deadline is always 11:59pm.</p><p>These are not essays, but structured reports, where you will analyze a topic using concepts taught in class and add your own research to reach an enlightened conclusion.</p><p>Further instructions and a dropbox will be available on LEARN.</p><h3>Self-Assessments</h3><p>There are three self-assessments, spread evenly across the schedule, worth 5% each. The deadline is always 11:59pm.</p><p>You will reflect on your efforts and assign yourself a grade. I will review the self-assessments, and your grade should correspond with the provided rubric. If not, I may lower or raise the grade.</p><p>Further instructions and a dropbox will be available on LEARN.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

  Administrative Policy

<div>
<h3>Course policies</h3><h4>Asking for help.</h4><p><strong>Please: Don’t be afraid to ask for help! There’s no shame!</strong></p><p>Being a student is challenging and <strong>it is normal to need support from time-to-time.</strong> I know it can feel embarrassing to ask for help, but I seriously don’t mind helping everyone. That’s what I’m here for, and I won’t think anything less of you.</p><p><strong>I also take mental health concerns seriously.</strong> Students who are experiencing anxiety, stress, or other mental health issues, whether related to this course or not, can get in touch with me at any time. I will always listen and do what I can to help.</p><p>There are mental health professionals available at UW's <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Counselling Services and Campus Wellness</a> programs. If you need to speak with someone for emotional support, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/services/good2talk">Good2Talk</a> is a post-secondary student helpline based in Ontario, Canada that is available to all students.</p><h4>Extensions</h4><p>You can request <strong>three-day extensions</strong> for any and all Assignments or Self-Assessments, so long as you do so by noon on the day of the original deadline. Just email me and let me know how many extra days you need. You don’t need a reason or an excuse. I’m happy offering a small bit of flexibility.</p><p>There are no extensions for surveys, quizzes or in-class exercises.</p><h4>Gender-inclusive language</h4><p><strong>Gender-inclusive and fair language should be used in the interests of precision and politeness.</strong> <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/pronouns/gendered_pronouns_and_singular_they.html">It’s not hard to familiarize yourself with this kind of writing and why it’s important.</a></p><h4>Excessive disruptions</h4><p>Arriving late to class, talking loudly with neighbours, or using phones or laptops inappropriately in class can be disruptive to those around you. Excessive disruptions that affect others will not be tolerated. The TAs and I will call you out.</p><h4>Final grades</h4><p>There are no re-submissions or bonus assignments at the end of term to increase your grade. If you want to maximize your grade, ask for help before each deadline during the term from the instructor or TA.</p><p>I do not curve or adjust final grades. There is no “golden boot” that bumps a 79 to an 80. What you see on LEARN is what you’ll see on your official transcript, rounded to a whole integer.</p><h4>Feedback</h4><p><strong>I encourage students provide feedback at all times.</strong> Contact me directly or submit your thoughts to the Anonymous Feedback Survey on Learn. I will address all feedback as transparently and as soon as possible.</p><p> </p><h3>Generative AI</h3><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
