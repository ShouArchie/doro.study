  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>STV 202:</div>
<p>The course uses design as a vehicle for examining technology and society interaction, particularly how we design, create, and choose technology. This course has been created to introduce students to various methods to help them view design and technology from a technology-society perspective. The overriding aims of the course are to (a) develop an ability to see through the eyes of others and promote thinking about technology in terms of users as well as producers or creators, (b) develop critical thinking skills, and (c) present design and the choice of technology as an activity involving societal and individual concerns rather than as a purely technical matter. The course does not require advanced technical knowledge and is open to students of all faculties.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>The focus of the course is on good design, particularly where design relates to society and social issues. Good design reflects not only technical achievement but also responsiveness to social context and values. Topics include the nature of design, the social and cultural implications of design, the roles of designers in relation to the social contract, and design assessment in light of social values such as risk, fairness, progress, and sustainability. The focus of the course is on the design of technology but any designed system is open for examination and discussion.</p><p>The course material provides a mixture of theoretical concepts and practical cases of their application.</p>

<h3>Quizzes</h3><p>A 10-question, multiple-choice quiz is to be completed by each student on the course Learn site for each non-midterm module starting at the outset of week 2.  Quiz questions each week relate to the textbook chapter(s) assigned for that week.  Therefore, students should study each textbook chapter before taking the corresponding quiz.  </p><p>The point of these quizzes is to prompt initial engagement with course materials and provide initial feedback. The point is not to test students’ final command of the material, which is why quizzes occur before discussion of each chapter rather than after.</p><p>Each quiz lasts for 20 minutes and cannot be paused once started due to technical issues beyond my control.</p><h3>Design discussions</h3><p>Discussions are brief, in-class assignments completed in small groups.  Discussions will take place each non-workshop week after week 1.</p><h3>Design presentations</h3><p>Presentations are assessments of designs selected by students working in small groups.  They are to be submitted as short videos (ca. 5 minutes) and may be chosen for viewing in subsequent classes.  Details will be provided in a separate hand-out.</p><h3>Workshops</h3><p>In-class workshops are based on videos shown in class, which students discuss and respond to in small groups.  Details will be provided in separate hand-outs.</p><h3>Midterms</h3><p>Each midterm is to be an assessment of a design specified by the instructor, written independently by each student, on a “take-home” basis over four days (96 hours).  Midterm 1 covers chapters Good design through Culture, Midterm 2 covers chapters Social contract through Activism, and Midterm 3 covers chapters Risk through Sustainability.  Midterms will be held during Workshop weeks.  Details will be provided in a separate hand-out.</p><h3>Late submissions</h3><p>Late submissions for evaluation are not accepted except on grounds of illness, religious observance, or service interruptions.  See the University Policies section below.  In such cases, contact the instructor within 48 hours of the missed deadline in order discuss alternative arrangements.</p><h3>Grade exemptions</h3><p>To allow for situations not covered under the Late submissions policy (see below), each student’s lowest quiz, discussion,  presentation, and workshop grade will be dropped from the calculation of their overall grade in each of those categories.  This policy does apply to items that receive a grade of 0 due to non-completion.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
