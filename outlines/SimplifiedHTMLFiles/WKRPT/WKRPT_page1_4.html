<div>
<div>
<div>WKRPT 200 / WKRPT 300 / WKRPT 400:</div>
<p>A work-term report presenting in detail a technical project, activity, or analysis engaged by the student normally during the preceding work term. The report is evaluated on the basis of written communication skills and technical proficiency in the subject matter as demonstrated by the report. Work-term reports are required courses for the degree but their grades are not included in the average. However, failed work-term report evaluations may delay a student's progress as indicated in the Examinations and Promotions section of this calendar. Details regarding the evaluation of the work-term reports can be obtained from the student's program advisor.</p>

<p>In many civil, environmental, geological, and architectural engineering jobs, communication through technical writing is essential, since an engineering report is often the main deliverable. As such, developing the ability to communicate effectively in writing is an important requirement for all accredited engineering undergraduate programs in Canada. Work term reports are just one way the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at the University of Waterloo uses to help students improve their technical writing and communication skills. They are also an opportunity for students to showcase the experience they gained on work terms and demonstrate their ability to apply the knowledge gained in classrooms, labs, and through research to solve real-world engineering problems. Each undergraduate student in Civil, Environmental, Geological, and Architectural Engineering is required to complete three work term reports over the course of their program (see Course Schedule) and receive a grade of satisfactory or better on each. <strong><u>The work term report topic does not have to be directly related to your co-op term. </u></strong></p>

  Tentative Course Schedule

<div>
<p>All CEE undergraduate students are required to submit work term reports in specific academic terms identified below. </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Report</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Civil</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Environmental &amp; Geological</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Architectural</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>WKRPT 200</p></td><td><p>3A</p></td><td><p>2B</p></td><td><p>2B</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>WKRPT 300</p></td><td><p>3B</p></td><td><p>3A</p></td><td><p>3A</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>WKRPT 400</p></td><td><p>4A</p></td><td><p>4A</p></td><td><p>3B</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Each work report should reflect the student’s technical knowledge and experience up to that point. As students progress from WKRPT 200 to 400, both the technical depth and writing quality are expected to improve, with the WKRPT 400 treating an engineering problem with the rigour and care expected from a competent new graduate engineer and being comparable in quality to a professional engineering report that a consulting firm would submit to a client.</p><p>In each of the terms identified above, work term report courses follow the following general schedule:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Work report due (submission on LEARN)</td><td>Second Tuesday of term (16:30 EDT)</td></tr><tr><td>Marker feedback and meeting</td><td>Week 8-10</td></tr><tr><td>Resubmission deadline (submission on LEARN)</td><td>Last day of lectures (16:30 EDT)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Given that students are expected to write their work term reports during their co-op term, no extensions or accommodations will be provided.</strong></p><p>Late reports will not be accepted and incomplete reports that show lack of effort or critical thought will automatically receive a failing grade without a chance to resubmit. Refer to the Student Assessment section for information on how work term reports are evaluated.</p><p>Students are required to submit an electronic copy of their report on LEARN. Any questions regarding the course should be directed to the Work Term Report Coordinator (cee.wtrc@uwaterloo.ca). </p>

<p>Students are required to submit an electronic copy of their work term report on LEARN. Upon submission, the Work Term Report Coordinator assigns each report to a faculty member or graduate TA based on expertise. <u>Students cannot request a specific marker.</u> Refer to the CEE Work Term Report Evaluation Rubric posted on LEARN for a detailed breakdown of how work reports are evaluated. </p><p>Work term reports are evaluated for communication and technical content. Communication is weighted 60% and technical content 40% in determining the overall report grade as shown in the table below. </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="2"><p><strong>Overall report grade</strong></p></td><td colspan="4"><p><strong>Communication</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><i><strong>A+</strong></i></p></td><td><p><i><strong>A</strong></i></p></td><td><p><i><strong>B</strong></i></p></td><td><p><i><strong>C</strong></i></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4"><p><strong>Technical</strong></p><p><strong>Content</strong></p></td><td><p><i><strong>A+</strong></i></p></td><td><p>A+</p></td><td><p>A</p></td><td><p>A</p></td><td><p>B</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><i><strong>A</strong></i></p></td><td><p>A+</p></td><td><p>A</p></td><td><p>B</p></td><td><p>B</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><i><strong>B</strong></i></p></td><td><p>A</p></td><td><p>A</p></td><td><p>B</p></td><td><p>C</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><i><strong>C</strong></i></p></td><td><p>A</p></td><td><p>B</p></td><td><p>B</p></td><td><p>C</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>The letter grade is converted to a numeric value on the student's transcript.

An in-term resubmit does not mean a failing grade. It is an opportunity to respond to marker feedback, and if necessary, seek extra help to improve the report. </p><p><u>If you are required to resubmit your report, you must first meet with your marker to discuss the requirements. It is the student’s responsibility to contact the marker and set up the meeting.</u> Resubmits must be submitted on LEARN by <strong><u>16:30 EDT on the last day of classes</u></strong>. The resubmitted report will be reviewed by the original marker. If the student fails to resubmit or the resubmitted report is still unsatisfactory, the student will then receive a fail.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Since Fall 2020, CEE is using text matching software Turnitin to check work term reports for plagiarism. Turnitin also provides AI detection which will be used to screen reports for use of generative AI (e.g., Chat GPT). <br/><br/>If data security or confidentiality is a concern, students may elect not to have their report submitted to Turnitin. Please refer to the information posted on LEARN about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. <br/><br/>See Administrative Policy below for more information and links. <br/>
</p>
<div>

<a></a>
<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Confidential Reports</h4><p>All CEE work term reports are treated as confidential academic documents. Reports and all associated records can only be accessed by a limited number of academic personnel. Details of the report are never discussed with anyone, and all marked reports are returned directly to the student. </p><p>The content of a work report remains confidential within the department provided that the report adheres to the policies and standards of practice of the University of Waterloo, Faculty of Engineering, and Professional Engineers of Ontario (PEO). In the event of a possible policy or standard violation, a work report coordinator will review the report and consult the appropriate academic or professional authority.</p><p>Students should always verify with the employer the sensitivity of all information contained in a work report. In certain situations (e.g., project bids, assessments), the employer may not want specifics of the project being disclosed.  If this is the case, reports can be anonymized to hide sensitive information such as names, locations, etc. If confidentiality is still a concern, the student should consult with the employer and work report coordinators on the best course of action. CEE does not allow employers to mark work term reports or sign non-disclosure agreements.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of technical writing skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>
