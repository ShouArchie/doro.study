<p>Water is an essential resource for human civilizations and the natural world. As civil and environmental engineers, we are often asked to find, move, control, protect and restore our water resources. To do so, we need to understand and model the processes by which water moves through the environment and in engineered systems. Climate and biodiversity crises also mean that we need to consider how water resources can be used for mitigation and adaptation in a world where the future will be unlike the past. The objectives of this course are to introduce water resource engineering, teach the fundamentals of modelling the relevant processes, and equip you with the ability to complete simple designs for engineering applications. </p>

<p>Lectures will be in person only.  Fillable course notes will be provided through the term on the course website (LEARN).  Inked notes will be uploaded to LEARN upon completion of each unit.</p><p>Questions should be posted to Piazza (<a href=" https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/cive382">https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/cive382</a>).  Please do not email the instructor or the TAs directly as your messages may be lost in the general flood of emails.  Questions related to the course content/ assignments/lectures/laboratories etc. should be made public for students to see because they may have the same question and may know the answer. You should respond to other posts as you see fit to enrich the discussion. Direct messaging to the instructor and/or TAs should be used if the question is relevant only to yourself.  It may not be feasible for the instructor or TAs to be able to respond to posts quickly.   Please respect our off-work hours in the evening and on weekends.  We also have other obligations during the week and it may take a few days for you to receive an answer. We will try to respond to posts more quickly close to course deliverable deadlines.</p><p>A problem set will be posted to Learn each week.  For select problems, the approach will be presented in the tutorial and students will be given time to complete the problems step by step.  The completed problems will then be submitted to Crowdmark before the end of the tutorial.  These tutorial problems will be worth 8% of your final grade.  Only the best 8 tutorial assignments will be included in your final grade.  No late submissions are permitted for tutorial problems unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor prior to the tutorial.</p><p>Additional problems from the problem set will be selected for weekly assignments. Weekly assignments are due on Mondays at noon (12 pm) and should be submitted through Crowdmark. Assignments that are less than 2 days late will be accepted with a 15% late penalty per day, while those that are that are more than 2 days late without a legitimate excuse (as deemed by the instructor) will receive no marks. Weekly assignments will be worth 12% of your final grade. Only the best 8 assignments will be counted towards your final grade.  Submissions must be well-organized, neat, and legible. They should be organized such that they follow the Assignment_Expectations.pdf that has been uploaded to the course Learn website.</p><p>Lab reports must be well-organized, neat, and legible. They should largely follow CEE Guidelines for Work Reports (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/civil-environmental-engineering/sites/default/files/uploads/files/cee-wkrpt_guidelines2013.pdf">https://uwaterloo.ca/civil-environmental-engineering/sites/default/files/uploads/files/cee-wkrpt_guidelines2013.pdf</a>), though no submission letter is required. The quality of your source will also be graded (i.e. textbooks, academic journals, and government documents are considered good sources, while unverified posts in social media or in unaffiliated websites are poor sources). If you are in doubt, contact your instructor. Lab reports will be due Mondays at 10 pm. Reports that are less than 2 days late will be accepted with a 15% late penalty per day, while those that are that are more than 2 days late without a legitimate excuse (as deemed by the instructor) will receive no marks.  Lab reports must be submitted through Crowdmark.</p><p>The midterm will be held in person during the week of Feb 10-14 (exact date decided in class). The test will cover material from weeks 1-6 (hydrology) of the course.  The final exam will be held in person during the scheduled exam period.  The final will only cover material from weeks 7-12 (open channel flow) of the course (i.e. it is not cumulative). </p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
