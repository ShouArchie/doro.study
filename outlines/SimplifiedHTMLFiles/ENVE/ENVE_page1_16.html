<p>One of the key responsibilities of the environmental engineering profession is to monitor, assess, and clean up environmental contamination in the soil, water, and air.  Engineers are tasked to develop, implement, and design technology and best management practices to mitigate contamination, interpret uncertain environmental data to determine the source(s) and or fate of environmental contaminants, and make predictions about how past and future pollution may pose a health threat to humans and ecosystems. The objective of this course is to introduce you to theoretical and practical aspects of mass transport in natural environmental systems, and to learn how to model mass transport processes.</p>
</div>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Submitted assignments must be completed as an individual or a group of two. Any exceptions to individual or group of two work must be acknowledged, including the use of generative AI. If you are in doubt, contact the teaching team.<br/><br/>For assignments you are encouraged to seek/give help from/to peers, but this help must stop short of using another peer’s or group’s work as your own. The best practice is to receive/give help without exchanging copies of the work. Then redoing the work on your own.<br/><br/>Submitted assignments are not formally screened using software, but the teaching team may compare submitted assignments to other assignments submitted this term and/or from previous terms.
