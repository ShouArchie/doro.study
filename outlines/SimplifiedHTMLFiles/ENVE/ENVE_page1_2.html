<p>Many practical physical and engineering problems can be analyzed using mathematical models formulated in terms of ordinary differential equations; these often arise from the application of mass, momentum, or energy balance laws. The objective of this course is to equip engineering students with a working knowledge of the methods which are used to solve these equations. Differential equations are introduced, along with standard methods of solution for first and second order linear equations with constant coefficients.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Submitted assignments must be completed as an individual.  Any exceptions to individual work must be acknowledged, including the use of generative AI.  If you are in doubt, contact the teaching team. <br/><br/>For assignments you are encouraged to seek/give help from/to peers, but this help must stop short of using another peer’s or group’s work as your own.  The best practice is to receive/give help without exchanging copies of the work.  Then redoing the work on your own.<br/><br/>Submitted assignments are not formally screened using software, but the teaching team may compare submitted assignments to other assignments submitted this term and/or from previous terms.

When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
