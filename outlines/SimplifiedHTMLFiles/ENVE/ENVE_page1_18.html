<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>CIVE 583 / ENVE 583:</div>
<p>Design of water supply and distribution systems. Design of waste and storm water collection systems. Storm water management. The course consists of 24 hours of lectures and a subdivision design project. The emphasis is on computer aided design and sustainability, using commonly used software packages.</p>

<p>CIVE 583 is intended for students who are interested in water resource engineering.  The goal of the course is for you to apply knowledge from previous courses on fluid mechanics, hydrology and open channel flow to the particular problem of city building. This area of work is needed to designing resilient water supply and drainage systems that address the challenge of ongoing climate and biodiversity crises.</p><p>The course has several theme areas including storm water management, drinking water supply systems, and waste water drainage systems. We will consider pressure and open channel flow processes, pumping and storage, analysis and design of water distribution systems, design of collection systems (storm and sanitary), approaches to storm water management (BMP’s, LID, etc.) and urban hydrologic modelling/design. For each theme area, assignments will involve review of theory, hand calculations, EXCEL solutions, MATLAB solutions, software tutorials, and design problems using site data, problem statements, and municipal or provincial design criteria/constraints.  The two major units on stormwater management and drinking water distribution will be tested with design challenge problems.</p>

<p>Weekly assignments will consist of an in-class and a homework portion.  In-class assignments should be completed and submitted during the lab session. Homework will be submitted before the lab session of the following week. Assignments which are less than 2 days late will be accepted with a 15% late penalty per day. Assignments more than 2 days late without what is deemed by the instructor to be a legitimate excuse will receive no marks.  </p><p>Assignments must follow a standard memo format that I will provide.  Your assignments must be submitted to Crowdmark in a pdf format.  For best results you should first arrange your answers in the memo (Word format) using a combination of text and high quality figures and then print to pdf to produce the final document for submission. <strong>Results should be printed and uploaded separately for each question</strong> to ensure that we can mark your assignment easily and provide feedback in Crowdmark.</p><p>Two projects will be assigned through the term. These projects will be completed in groups of 3-4 students.  <strong>Project 1 </strong>will focus on improving an aspect of stormwater management on the University of Waterloo Campus. <strong>Project 2</strong> will focus on designing a pumping system and sewer mains for the City of Elmira. </p><p>Projects must follow the standard memo format. They should be of engineering report quality and organized such that someone can check your work and understand your solution. Messy, incomprehensible work may not be graded.  <strong>Learning to produce high quality reports for submission is part of the desired course outcomes</strong> </p><p>Outside sources, including from the textbook, reputable online sources, or other appropriate sources must be cited.  The quality of your source will also be graded (i.e. textbooks, academic journals, and government documents are considered good sources.  Unverified posts in social media or in unaffiliated websites are poor sources).  If you are in doubt, contact your instructor.</p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as <strong>[fill this in with your discipline-specific skills]</strong>. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
