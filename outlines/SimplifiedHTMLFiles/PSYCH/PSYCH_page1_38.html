<p>From the moment infants enter the world, they vary widely in how they respond to new people, places, and things. In turn, these inborn tendencies affect the way children participate in, and think about, their social worlds. In this class we will use a bioecological framework, to discuss proximal (e.g., interactions with parents, peers) and distal (e.g., experiences at school and in extracurricular activities) factors that influence the development of shy children. Each week we will be reading and discussing pivotal works on the topic of shyness and introversion. Each class we will discuss chapters from <i><strong>Quiet Power</strong> </i>as well as empirical and/or theoretical papers related to the chapter topics. These papers are selected to reflect cross-disciplinary approaches to studying shyness with papers selected from diverse fields of psychological science including educational psychology, social psychology, and developmental psychology. Our goal will be to use these sources of information to debunk several common misconceptions about shyness and to reflect upon policies and practices that can help optimize the development of shy children.</p>

<p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p><p><strong>Attendance and Participation (20% of final grade): </strong>This portion of your grade is based on your attendance and the <i>quality </i>of your contributions to class discussions (both in-class and discussion board posts). </p><ul><li>For Weeks 2 – 9, students will submit to the discussion board a) 2 ideas or themes from the assigned readings they found most interesting or thought-provoking, and b) 1 wonderment (vs. factual) question they would be interested in discussing with the larger class. Discussion board posts are to be submitted each Wednesday by 11:59pm. Discussion board posts will be made accessible to the whole class and will be used by the weekly facilitators to guide the in-class discussion. Each student will be permitted to miss <i>one </i>week of posting without an impact on their grade. Beyond that, a failure to post by the weekly deadline will result in a deduction of 1% per week.</li><li>In Week 2, we will work together to develop a definition of high-quality classroom participation that reflects our understanding of individual differences. It is expected that students will actively participate in each class discussion. As a class, we agreed that high-quality engagement will consist of<i> [CREATED BASED ON WEEK 2 CLASS DISCUSSION] </i></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Discussion Facilitation (20% of final grade):  </strong>Students will be assigned to small groups to be discussion facilitators for <i>one class</i> (between Weeks 2 – 9) over the course of the semester. These discussions are anticipated to last for approximately 60-75 minutes. Using a link on LEARN, students will rank order their preferences for topics and groups will be created based on shared interests in topics. Groups are responsible for selecting one additional reading to complement the chapters and assigned readings, and for directing/facilitating the discussion during those classes. Students will present brief summaries of all readings and synthesize discussion posts to facilitate larger group discussion. With our focus being on discussion and casual conversation, PowerPoint slides should be used judiciously (i.e., as a guide for topics and thought questions vs. to be read from). There is no right or wrong way to facilitate a rich discussion.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Communication Outputs (30% of final grade):</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Infographic (15%) -</strong> Each student will generate <u>one</u> infographic to share with the class. You can use the infographic to explain the experiences of shy children or adolescents from a first-person perspective (i.e., how different contexts - like meeting someone for the first time, or the first day of school - are experienced by shy children) or as a way to suggest strategies for adults to create environments that optimize the “goodness of fit” for shy children. Be creative here – there really is no right or wrong. <strong>Due: February 14th, 2025 (a rubric will be posted on LEARN).</strong></li><li><strong>Op Ed (15%) - </strong>Each student will write <u>one</u> Op Ed piece. The Op Ed can be a maximum of 2 double-spaced pages in length. You can choose your audience, but the goal is to use the knowledge gained in class to debunk misconceptions or common stereotypes about shyness/introversion. We will review some Op Eds in the field of child psychology during class, so you have some prototypes to follow. If you want to practice being efficient, you could cover the same topic in your infographic and Op Ed (but this is not required). When you first start planning your Op Ed, I often find that drawing out my ideas help me organize my thinking and writing. <strong>Due: March 14th, 2025 (a rubric will be posted on LEARN).</strong></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Group Presentations to Community Members (30% of final grade): </strong>Each student will work with in a small group (3-4 students) to prepare a 45-minute presentation for a specific target audience (parents, teachers, school-aged children, teens, first-year university students, potential employers). Students will rank order their preferences for target audience and groups will be created based on shared interests. Students will use the lessons learned through readings and discussions over the course of the semester to provide concrete recommendations for optimizing growth and development of shy children/adolescents either to caregivers, teachers, or students themselves. <strong>The presentations will take place in the last two class meetings: March 28<sup>th</sup> and April 4<sup>th</sup> (a rubric will be posted on LEARN).</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Generative AI Policy</strong></p><p>As this course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as synthesizing and analyzing scientific information, and developing and practicing writing and communication skills, the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a></p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Late Work Policy</strong></p><p>Assignments are to be submitted by 11:59pm on the due date. Each student can request an extension of up to 48-hours on 1 of the 2 major course assignments without providing documentation. <u>You must contact the instructor (and ‘CC’ the course TA) to inform them of the request</u>. If you need an extension of more than 48 hours, you must provide documentation of personal illness, family emergency, or other extenuating circumstances. <strong>If you have not requested an extension of 48-hours/received an extension due to illness, family issues, or other extenuating circumstances, your grade will be lowered by 2 points (i.e., 10%) for each 24-hour period of delay.</strong></p>

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6.</p><p> </p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience.

However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.
