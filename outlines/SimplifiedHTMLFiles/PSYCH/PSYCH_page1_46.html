<p>This course provides an examination of the biological, social cognitive, interpersonal and contextual variables influencing children and adolescents’ social connections and sense of belonging. We will read, reflect upon, and discuss readings on the topic of social connections and human belonging. The course is divided into four sections: In the first section (Weeks 1-4) we will discuss the theoretical foundations for the study of social connections and belonging. In the second section (Weeks 5-6), we will examine factors that influence youths’ sense of belonging including individual/within-person factors and family relationships. In the third section (Weeks 7-10) we will examine various contexts in which belonging can be experienced, ranging from close relationships all the way out to spaces and places. Finally, we will evaluate the current literature on belonging interventions (Week 11). Throughout the semester, students will be encouraged to reflect on the specific mechanisms that might link social connections and belonging to optimal developmental outcomes. In each section, a blend of theoretical and empirical papers will be assigned and discussions will focus on relations between papers and relevance to students’ own research interests, where applicable. </p>

<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong></p><p><strong>Discussion Board Postings (20% final grade; due each Sunday by noon/12pm). </strong>Beginning in Week 2, you will post a weekly brief reflection paper on the readings to the discussion board on LEARN. Your reflections will provide the starting point for our class discussions on Mondays. The whole class will be able to view others’ reflections and the Discussion Facilitators (see below) will use the group reflections to identify critical points of overlap, divergence, and general interest. Your posted reflections should not simply be a summary of the readings. Rather, I want you to draw connections between the articles, relate the articles to your own areas of interest, and most importantly reflect on the previous weeks to think about the connections between topics. There is no prescribed length for your reflections – but I would think that 300-500 words would be about right. Please take the time to read others’ reflections before Monday’s class so you can actively participate in the class discussions. <i><strong>Students are required to submit reflections for eight of the ten weeks (no need to let the instructor know ahead of time which eight weeks you will submit). </strong></i></p><p> </p><p><strong>Discussion Facilitators (20% of final grade).</strong></p><p>Beginning in Week 2, groups of 3 or 4 students will serve as our discussion facilitators. The facilitators will work together to (1) select one additional supplemental reading, (2) identify common themes from the readings, and (3) incorporate additional resources to contextualize the material (e.g., offer a mini-tutorial on a novel method or analysis technique that is employed in one of the readings [e.g., social network analysis]; evaluate a popular press account of the topic). Facilitators will generate discussion questions based on their own reading as well as their review of other students’ reflection papers submitted on LEARN. Each student will serve as a facilitator <u>twice</u> throughout the semester. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Communication Outputs</strong> </p><p> </p><p><strong>            Explanatory Journalism Style Paper (20% final grade) and Peer Review (10% final grade)</strong>. Each student will (a) submit a preliminary draft and a final draft of <u>one</u> communication piece (20% final grade), and (2) provide <u>one</u> peer review of another student’s first draft (10% final grade). These 700-800 word articles will follow the format of papers published in <i>The Conversation </i>(<a href="https://theconversation.com/ca">https://theconversation.com/ca</a>). The purpose of such papers is for experts to explain new research and its significance to a non-expert audience. Samples of papers from the Conversation will be posted on LEARN as a reference point. Grading rubrics will be provided for both the final draft and the peer review. </p><p> </p><p><i>First drafts will be due on February 3<sup>rd</sup> and feedback on a peer’s draft will be due on February 24<sup>th</sup>. Final drafts that incorporate the peer feedback will be due on March 10<sup>th</sup>.</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>Mini Research Proposals (20% final grade) and Peer Review (10% final grade). </strong>Each student will (a) submit a preliminary draft and a final draft of <u>one </u>short research proposal (20% final grade), and (2) provide <u>one</u> peer review of another student’s first draft (10% final grade). In their proposal, students will articulate a novel research question and design a study to examine this question. Pretend money and time are no object! Each proposal should be no more than 2 single spaced pages long and should describe the rationale and aims for your study and include a brief description of the methods you will use to answer your questions. Be sure to clearly articulate <i>why </i>knowing the answer to this question is important. You are more than welcome to cover the same topic in your explanatory journalism piece and your research proposal. Grading rubrics will be provided for both the proposal and the peer review. </p><p> </p><p><i>First drafts of the proposal are due on March 3<sup>rd</sup> and feedback on a peer’s draft will be due March 17<sup>th</sup>. Final drafts that incorporate the peer feedback will be due on March 31<sup>st</sup>. </i> </p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
