<p><i><strong>Social Networks and the Workplace</strong></i></p><p>Greek philosopher Aristotle is known to have said that human beings are social creatures, and scholars continue to demonstrate that choice is not completely free. Human beings obtain value through social networks. This course explores the relevance, importance, and impact of social networks on individuals in the workplace and how networks affect their work-related outcomes – investigating areas such gender, culture, employment, leadership, etc., as related to individuals’ social networks. Learning in this course will take place through reading and discussing a variety of articles related to social networks, to explore what social networks are, why they are important, approaches to social network analysis, and their relevance in understanding organizational outcomes.  </p>

<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.<br/><br/>Any work that has significant similarity scores will be reviewed under Policy 71 offences. Please do not submit any of your own previously submitted work, someone else’s work or copy another source’s work without the use of proper citations and references. If you have any concerns or questions about this, always reach out to the instructor first to clarify.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as collecting, synthesizing, and analyzing information; developing and practicing writing skills; expression of critical and creative thinking. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations"><u>accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</u></a> under the<u> </u>Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i><u>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</u></i></a>.

In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  </p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website</a> </p><h4>Declaring Absences</h4><p>For all of the following categories of absence students are responsible for getting in touch with their course instructors as soon as possible to discuss possible accommodations for the missed course component(s).

Research participation is one example of this, article review is another. A number of undergraduate courses have been expanded to include opportunities for psychology students to earn grades while gaining research experience.</p><p>Since experiential learning is highly valued in the Department of Psychology, students may earn up to 3% of their final mark in this course through research experience (i.e., course work will make up 97% of the final mark and research experience will make up the other 3% for a maximum grade of 100%). <strong>Be sure to review the guidelines referred to later in this document.</strong></p><p>The two options for earning research experience grades; participation in research through online remotely operated and In Lab studies, as well as article review; are described below. Students may complete any combination of these options to earn research experience grades. Credits will be permitted to be earned with half from online, and the other half (1.5) from In-lab or Remote Access studies.</p><p><strong>Option 1:  Participation in Psychology Research</strong></p><p>Research participation is coordinated by the Research Experiences Group (REG). Psychology students may volunteer as research participants in remotely operated, In Lab and/or online (web-based) studies conducted by students and faculty in the Department of Psychology. Participation enables students to learn first-hand about psychology research and related concepts. Many students report that participation in research is both an educational and interesting experience.
