<div>
<p>I like to think of social psychology as the science of empathy. Empathy involves taking another person's perspective on a situation to try to understand how that person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviours might represent sensible responses to their situation as they perceive it. Social psychologists' theories and research findings provide us with conceptual tools that enrich our capacity to get inside other people's heads and appreciate the social forces that they are responding to. </p><p>Behaviours that seem puzzling or paradoxical begin to make sense when we use the tools of social psychological analysis to understand situations from the other person's perspective. Indeed, in this course we will apply social psychological concepts to resolve a number of intriguing puzzles and along the way we will answer questions such as:</p><ul><li>How can our desire to avoid making an awkward scene lead us to carry out an authority figure's immoral commands or go along with a reckless crowd?</li><li>Why can a traditional norm persist in a community despite the fact that the majority of people who publicly follow that norm no longer privately endorse it?</li><li>How can a person's need to rationalize their past commitments lead them to persist on a course of action even when it no longer serves their interests?</li><li>Why are victims less likely to receive help when many bystanders are present than when a single bystander is present?</li><li>In what ways can befriending a person from another group help to undo prejudice towards that group?</li><li>Why do individuals and societies that claim to value human rights continue to perpetrate violent oppression against minority groups?</li><li>Why are people extraordinarily compassionate when they observe a single victim's tragedy even while they ignore mass tragedies that have hundreds of thousands of victims?</li></ul><p>In this course the readings and activities will emphasize experimental social psychological research on a variety of topics including:</p><ul><li>understanding stuational pressures that lead us to obey unjust authorites and censor ourselves when we disagree with the majority in a group,</li><li>examining how we form impressions of other people,</li><li>investigating the structure of attitudes and the strategies for persuading people to change their attitudes,</li><li>understanding how stereotypes and prejudices form and why they persist,</li><li>exploring how people cope with stigma and discrimination,</li><li>examining the dynamics of intergoup hostility and aggression,</li><li>investigating the roots of social and political polarization,</li><li>explaining the sources of interpersonal attraction and the value of close relationships,</li><li>and exploring what motivates people to engage in selfless acts of altruism.</li></ul><p>Important features of the course:  </p><ul><li>There are many opportunities for you to get feedback on your learning through <strong>Check and Reflect</strong> and <strong>Try and Apply</strong> concept checks. These interactive questions are embedded in the learning modules and are a core aspect of this course. It is critical that you click for feedback and check your responses as the feedback sometimes contains content that may not appear elsewhere in the course. Skipping these questions will result in missing some core content and knowledge that will be tested in the quizzes and final examination.</li><li>A major feature of the course is a <strong>group assignment</strong> that gives you the opportunity to collaborate with other students to apply your knowledge of social psychology in creative ways to solve practical problems that are of interest to you. The work that you will do to apply these concepts will help you to think about those concepts more deeply and explore the relevance of social psychology to the real world.</li><li>The process of working collaboratively on the group project will also provide many opportunities to observe some of the group processes and social dynamics that you learn about in this course in your interactions with your collaborators.</li></ul><p> </p>

<h3>COURSE POLICIES</h3><h4>Independent work on quizzes </h4><p>All quizzes involve independent work. The answers that you submit to quizzes should be your own independent work without any collaboration or discussion with others. If you have questions about any of the content of the quizzes these should be directed to the TAs or the course instructor, not to other students or anyone outside the course. Also, after you complete the quiz it is not permissible to share the answers with other students or anyone else. The quiz contents and answers belong to this course and you may not share or distribute them to others without the instructor's permission.   </p><h4>Deadlines for assignments and quizzes </h4><p>All assessments must be submitted by the scheduled deadlines to receive credit. Any assessments that are submitted after their scheduled deadlines will not be graded unless an extension was approved by the course instructor to accommodate a documented extenuating circumstance.  </p><h4>Accommodation for course requirements </h4><p>Students requesting accommodation for course requirements (assignments, quizzes, final exams, etc.) due to illness should follow the procedures described in the 'University Policies' section of the syllabus   </p><p><strong>In the case of a missed final exam</strong>, see the accommodations described in 'University Policies' section of the syllabus.   </p><p><strong>In the case of bereavement</strong>, the instructor will provide similar accommodations to those for illness.  Appropriate documentation to support the request will be required.  </p><p>Students who are experiencing extenuating circumstances should also inform their academic advisors regarding their personal difficulties.   </p><p>Elective arrangements such as travel plans are not acceptable grounds for granting accommodations to course requirements per the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/academic-regulations-related-assignments-tests-and-final">uWaterloo Examination Regulations and Related Matters</a>. </p><h3>DEPARTMENT POLICIES</h3><h4>Informal resolution of conflict  </h4><p>We in the Psychology Department take great pride in the high quality of our program and our instructors. Though infrequent, we know that students occasionally find themselves in situations of conflict with their instructors over course policies or grade assessments. If such a conflict arises, the Department Chair (Heather Henderson) is available for consultation and to mediate a resolution between the student and instructor: Email: <a href="mailto:hhenderson@uwaterloo.ca"><u>hhenderson@uwaterloo.ca</u></a>; Ph 519-888-4567 ext. 31597</p><p>If informal resolution is not possible then the issue may proceed to the grievance and appeals stage as described in the University Policies section of the syllabus.  </p><h4>Using official UW email </h4><p>Students are responsible for all e-mail that is sent to the official uWaterloo email address. Check e-mail regularly for important and time sensitive messages. <strong>See </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/information-systems-technology/about/policies-standards-and-guidelines/email/statement-official-student-email-address"><strong>Statement on official student e-mail address</strong></a><strong> for further details e.g., procedures and warnings regarding forwarding e-mail to other accounts.</strong></p><h3>MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES </h3><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">Campus Wellness</a> aim is to provide holistic programming and services to help you lead a healthy and balanced life.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spaces/">multi-faith spaces</a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.
