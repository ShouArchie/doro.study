<h3>Weekly Discussions</h3><p>You will participate regularly in group discussions focusing on the course concepts covered during the week. You will be asked to reflect on how the content that you learned in class can be applied to your life, or society at large, and engage in discussion with your fellow students.</p><p>Each week on LEARN, you will post an initial reflection post and comment on two other students’ reflection posts. Your initial posts will be due on Fridays at 11:59 pm. Your replies to other students’ posts will be due the following Wednesdays at 11:59 pm.</p><p>To receive full marks on each week’s reflection, your posts and comments should be substantive and thoughtful. </p><p>“I thought this week’s materials were interesting” and “I agree” are examples of a superficial post and reply that would not receive full marks. </p><p>A full description of this activity can be found on LEARN.</p><h3>News Report Assignment</h3><p>The purpose of this assignment is to help you become a critical consumer of scientific research, practice developing empirical research, and understand the intricacies of accurately portraying scientific findings in the media.</p><p>As a group you will begin by finding a research article from a reputable journal. You will then fill out a point-form critique template summarizing the most important variables and findings from the article. With this key information in hand, you will write a review of the article and propose improvements / future directions for the line of research discussed. You will then prepare a media-style news report presentation for a lay audience that explains the findings and conclusions of the article and presents your proposed extension / follow-up study.</p><p>The rubric for this assignment can be found on LEARN. </p><p>Everyone in your group will receive the same grade for the group components. If you have any concerns, please reach out to the Instructor.</p><h3>In-Class Exams</h3><p>Each exam will include 50 multiple-choice questions. They are not cumulative.</p><p>The Midterm covers materials from Weeks 1 to 5 (inclusive)</p><p>The Final Exam covers materials from Weeks 6 to 10 (inclusive)</p><p> </p><p><strong>Sona Participation and Research Experience Marks</strong><br/><strong>Information and Guidelines</strong></p><p>Experiential learning is considered an integral part of the undergraduate program in Psychology. Research participation is one example of this, article review is another. A number of undergraduate courses have been expanded to include opportunities for Psychology students to earn grades while gaining research experience.</p><p>Since experiential learning is highly valued in the Department of Psychology, students may earn a <strong>"bonus" grade of up to 4%</strong> in this course through research experience. Course work will make up 100% of the final mark and a "bonus" of up to 4% may be earned and will be added to the final grade if/as needed to bring your final grade up to 100%.</p><p>The two options for earning research experience grades; participation in research through online, remotely operated and In Lab studies, as well as article review; are described below. Students may complete any combination of these options to earn research experience grades Credits will be permitted to be earned with a maximum of half from online, and the other half (2.0) from In-lab or Remote Access studies (In Lab studies can however go over the limit up to the total of 4.0)</p><p><strong>Option 1: Participation in Psychology Research</strong></p><p>Research participation is coordinated by the Research Experiences Group (REG). Psychology students may volunteer as research participants in remotely operated, In Lab and/or online (web-based) studies conducted by students and faculty in the Department of Psychology. Participation enables students to learn first-hand about psychology research and related concepts. Many students report that participation in research is both an educational and interesting experience. Please be assured that all Psychology studies have been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Board. </p><p><i><strong>How to earn extra marks for your Psychology course(s) this term by participating in studies ...</strong></i></p><ul><li>You will earn "credits" which will be converted to "marks" (1 credit = 1%)</li><li>You can schedule your remotely operated (replacing in-lab) and ONLINE studies using the "Sona" website.</li><li>You can schedule your In-Person studies through SONA as well but please note the time and location</li></ul><p><i><strong>Educational focus of participation in research</strong></i></p><p>To maximize the educational benefits of participating in research, students will receive feedback information following their participation in each study detailing the following elements:</p><ul><li>Purpose or objectives of the study</li><li>Dependent and independent variables</li><li>Expected results</li><li>References for at least two related research articles</li><li>Provisions to ensure confidentiality of data</li><li>Contact information of the researcher should the student have further questions about the study</li><li>Contact information for the Director of the Office of Research Ethics should the student wish to learn more about the general ethical issues surrounding research with human participants, or specific questions or concerns about the study in which s/he participated.</li></ul><p>Participation in remotely operated (counts as the same as in-lab) studies has increment values of 0.5 participation credits (grade percentage points) for each 30-minutes of participation. Participation in ONLINE studies is worth .25 credits for each 15-minutes of participation. Researchers will record student’s participation and at the end of the term the REG Coordinator will provide the course instructor with a credit report of the total credits earned by each student. </p><p>. </p><p><i><strong>How to participate?</strong></i></p><p><strong>Study scheduling, participation and grade assignment is managed using the SONA online system.  All students enrolled in this course have been set up with a SONA account.  You must get started early in the term.</strong></p><p><strong>For instructions on how to log in to your SONA account and for a list of important dates and deadlines please, as soon as possible, go to:</strong></p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/welcome-research-experiences-group-and-sona/sona-information">Participating/SONA information:  How to log in to Sona and sign up for studies</a></p><p><i>*** Please do not ask the Course Instructor or REG Coordinator for information unless you have first thoroughly read the information provided on this website.***</i></p><p>More information about the REG program in general is available at: <br/><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/welcome-research-experiences-group-and-sona/sona-information">Sona Information on the REG Participants website</a> or you can check the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/sites/ca.research-experiences-group/files/uploads/files/sona_faq_for_fall_2019.pdf">Sona FAQ on the REG website homepage</a> for additional information. </p><p><strong>Option 2: Article Review as an alternative to participation in research</strong></p><p>Students are not required to participate in research, and not all students wish to do so. As an alternative, students may opt to gain research experience by writing short reviews (1½ to 2 pages) of research articles relevant to the course. The course instructor will specify a suitable source of articles for this course (i.e., scientific journals, newspapers, magazines, other printed media). <i>You must contact your instructor to get approval for the article you have chosen before writing the review. </i>Each review article counts as one percentage point. To receive credit, you must follow specific guidelines. The article review must:</p><ul><li><strong>Be submitted before the </strong><a href="http://www.quest.uwaterloo.ca/undergraduate/dates.html">last day of lectures</a><strong>. Late submissions will NOT be accepted under ANY circumstances.</strong></li><li>Be typed</li><li>Fully identify the title, author(s), source and date of the article. A copy of the article must be attached.</li><li>Identify the psychological concepts in the article and indicate the pages in the textbook that are applicable. Critically evaluate the application or treatment of those concepts in the article. If inappropriate or incorrect, identify the error and its implications for the validity of the article. You may find, for example, misleading headings, faulty research procedures, alternative explanations that are ignored, failures to distinguish factual findings from opinions, faulty statements of cause-effect relations, errors in reasoning, etc. Provide examples whenever possible.</li><li>Clearly evaluate the application or treatment of those concepts in the article.</li><li>Keep a copy of your review in the unlikely event we misplace the original.</li></ul><p> </p>

<h2>Renison University College Land Acknowledgement</h2><p>With gratitude, we acknowledge that Renison University College is located on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg, Hodinohsyó:ni, and Attawandaran (Neutral) Peoples, which is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes ten kilometres on each side of the Grand River from mouth to source. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place in all corners of our campus through research, learning, teaching, community building and outreach. We are guided by the work of our Reconciliation and Re-storying Steering Committee and Anti-Racism and Decolonization Spokescouncil, as well as the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/hrei/indigenousinitiatives">University of Waterloo’s Office of Indigenous Relations </a>.</p><h4>Late Work </h4><p>Unless an accommodation has been provided for a documented extenuating circumstance, assignments are due on the listed due date, and tests must be written on the scheduled date at the scheduled time (see below for information about accommodation).<br/><br/>Missed tests will receive a grade of 0. Late assignments will not be accepted without an approved extension.</p><h4>Attendance Policy</h4><p>Attendance is strongly encouraged. Much of the course content we will be covering does not appear in your readings or appears only in limited detail. Thus, attending class is essential for doing well in this class.</p><h4>Final Examination Policy</h4><p>For <strong>Winter 2024</strong>, the established examination period is <strong>April 11 - April 25.</strong> The schedule will be available early in the winter. Students should be aware that student travel plans are not acceptable grounds for granting an alternative final examination time (see: <a href="Final%20Examination%20Schedule%20https:/uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations">Final Examination Schedule https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations</a> </p><h4>Accommodation for Illness or Unforeseen Circumstances:</h4><p>The instructor follows the practices of the University of Waterloo in accommodating students who have documented reasons for missing quizzes or exams. See <a href="http://www.registrar.uwaterloo.ca/students/accom_illness.html">http://www.registrar.uwaterloo.ca/students/accom_illness.html</a> </p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Chosen/Preferred First Name</h4><p>Do you want professors and interviewers to call you by a different first name? Take a minute now to verify or tell us your chosen/preferred first name by logging into <a href="https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/"><u>WatIAM</u></a>.</p><p>Why?

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.

Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.
