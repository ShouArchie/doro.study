<p>The purpose of Psych 470, Negotiation in the Workplace, is to introduce the theories and processes of interdependent decision making and conflict management as they play out every day in an organizational setting. Students will learn to recognize, analyze, and manage a broad spectrum of negotiation situations faced by HR professionals, general managers, and employees working on teams or with others. Topics include distributive and integrative negotiations, coalitions, negotiating on teams, dispute resolution, and multi-party negotiations. Psych 470 students will conduct a multi-round negotiation outside of class and will write a critical analysis of their negotiation processes and outcomes. </p>

<p><strong>1. Negotiation Essentials</strong></p><p>The textbook is available for short-term loan through course reserves at the library. The E-text is available for purchase through Vital Source, which can be found under "Contents" on Learn. Note there are two purchase options - 180 day ($59.00) or lifetime ($99.99).</p><p>Students will have free trial access until Jan 20th, at which time they will need to purchase. With Vitalsource, students need to create an account to access the trial version. </p><p>NOTE ON READINGS: You are to read assignments after class, unless otherwise noted. PLEASE NOTE: If you use an earlier version of the text, please be sure to check the weekly TOPIC and read the chapter associated with that topic in your edition. </p><p><strong>2. Negotiation and Case Simulations</strong></p><p>The role-play cases we use in class simulate real-world examples of workplace negotiation and conflict management. To maximize students’ experience working with as many other classmates as possible and to accommodate for weekly absences, students are assigned the role of a specific organizational actor to prepare for class one week in advance. Because role assignments vary for each student week-by-week, we do not use a traditional course case packet. Rather, I pre-pay for the instructional materials and then distribute them to students personally each week. Cases are purchased from Negotiation and Team Resources Institute and cost $3.50 USD each. In this class we will use 10 cases @ $3.50 each = $35.00 USD. This is $50.27 CAD using the Jan 6, 2025 exchange rate. </p><ul><li><i><strong>Pre-purchased case fees of $50.27 CAD must be paid by e-transfer to </strong></i><a href="mailto:wladair@uwaterloo.ca"><i><strong>wladair@uwaterloo.ca</strong></i></a><i><strong> by January 21.</strong></i></li><li>The use of experiential cases for instructional purposes in this course has been approved by the Arts Faculty Dean.</li></ul><p> </p>

Planning Documents (20%).</strong> In our second session, we will discuss effective negotiation planning strategies. You will then create your own planning document as you prepare outside of class for subsequent cases. Please use Times New Roman 12-point font and single-spaced lines. </p><p>Upload your planning document to Learn 30 minutes before class starts, by 11:00 am EST. Have your planning document handy for reference while you negotiate.</p><p>Late Planning Documents will be accepted for up to 50% credit. </p><p><strong>3. Midterm Take-home Test (30%) Due Feb 14 at 5pm EST.</strong></p><p>The midterm test covers content from Lewicki Chapters 1-9 plus any additional concepts covered in class to date. The test will include 2-3 essay questions asking you to make an extended argument or evaluation, provide a solution to a new problem or case study, or analyze a new text or problem using frameworks from the course. You will not be expected to remember details of the cases we negotiated in class. You will be expected to apply the concepts to hypothetical scenarios or real-world cases.</p><p>This essay-based exam asks you to demonstrate that you know how to retrieve, apply, and integrate information covered during the course. It should be completed individually and independently. You may incorporate materials from class (textbook, lecture notes, your in-class simulations) and your own lived experience in your answers. </p><p>Students will be expected to sign and submit an honour code statement along with their test, acknowledging that 1) the work submitted is entirely their own, 2) they have not collaborated with other students during the take-home test, and 3) they have not accessed resources beyond the course textbook, course notes, and personal experiences. </p><p>Test questions will be made available one-week prior to the due date. You have an entire week to work on these tests, but do not leave it to the last minute. Start early so you have time to gather information, strategize, write, and revise your answers. Students are expected to spend 8-10 hours on the midterm test. This includes: </p><ul><li>Reading through the questions</li><li>Taking notes/outlining key points for each question</li><li>Looking up details (e.g. theories, frameworks, definitions, examples) in the textbook and course notes</li><li>Writing a 3-5 paragraph draft response to each question</li><li>Revising and editing responses to each question</li><li>Please use Times New Roman, 12-point font, and double-spaced lines.</li><li>Proofreading, editing, and submitting final draft</li><li>You do not need to include in-text citations or a reference section</li></ul><p>Tests should be uploaded to Learn by 5:00pm EST on the due date. Grading will be based on:</p><ul><li>Correct understanding and application of negotiation concepts and phenomena</li><li>Reasonable and meaningful connections between course concepts and the case/situation/scenario</li><li>Clear, concise, grammatically correct, and typo-freewriting</li></ul><p><strong>4. PSYCH 470 Final Project:</strong> <i><strong>Paper Clip Project</strong></i></p><p>During the term, you will engage in a series of trade negotiations outside of class. You will be given a paperclip that you are challenged to trade up to generate the most value. You must complete a minimum of 8 trades over the course of the term. You will track your preparation and strategy for each trade and in a final paper you will analyze your execution and outcome. You must analyze at least one trade addressing each of the following topics:</p><ol><li>Distributive vs integrative negotiation (Chs 2 &amp; 3)</li><li>Negotiator cognition (Ch 5)</li><li>Framing (Ch 5)</li><li>Emotion in negotiation (Ch 6)</li><li>Nonverbal communication (Ch 7)</li><li>Power &amp; Persuasion (Ch 8)</li></ol><p>You will be provided a template for tracking each negotiation experience. This trade log will be submitted and graded as part of your final project. </p><p><strong>Video Presentation (Due April 11, 5:00 pm) (5%). </strong>Three-minute video 1) summarizing your trading experience, 2) analyzing your most interesting trade using concepts from the course, and 3) showing us evidence of the last item you received, posted to Learn.</p><p><strong>Final Project (Due April 11, 5:00 pm)</strong> <strong>(25%). </strong>Five-page paper (double spaced, 12 point times roman font, APA 7 format for headings, citations, and references) analyzing your overall trading experience, integrating concepts from the textbook and class discussion. For this paper, you should analyze a minimum of 6 of your trades, expanding on the notes you kept in your trade log, addressing each of the 6 topics above. Please include your trade log as an appendix. </p><p>Grading will be based on:</p><ul><li>Completed trade log showing evidence of planning, execution, and valuation</li><li>Correct understanding and application of negotiation concepts</li><li>Critical analysis of one’s overall experience in the paper</li><li>Clear, concise, grammatically correct, and typo-freewriting</li><li>Presentation content, organization, mechanics, visualization, and audience engagement for video presentation</li></ul><p><strong>5. Sona Participation and Research Experience Marks</strong><br/><strong>Information and Guidelines</strong></p><p>Experiential learning is considered an integral part of the undergraduate program in Psychology. Research participation is one example of this, article review is another. A number of undergraduate courses have been expanded to include opportunities for Psychology students to earn grades while gaining research experience.</p><p>Since experiential learning is highly valued in the Department of Psychology, students may earn a <strong>"Bonus" grade of up to 3%</strong> in this course through research experience. Course work will make up 100% of the final mark and your SONA will add up to an additional 3% to this final grade.</p><p>The two options for earning research experience grades; participation in research through online remotely operated and In Lab studies, as well as article review; are described below. Students may complete any combination of these options to earn research experience grades. Credits will be permitted to be earned with half from online, and the other half (1.5) from In-lab or Remote Access studies.</p><p><strong>Option 1: Participation in Psychology Research</strong></p><p>Research participation is coordinated by the Research Experiences Group (REG). Psychology students may volunteer as research participants in remotely operated, In Lab and/or online (web-based) studies conducted by students and faculty in the Department of Psychology. Participation enables students to learn first-hand about psychology research and related concepts. Many students report that participation in research is both an educational and interesting experience. Please be assured that all Psychology studies have been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Board. </p><p><i><strong>How to earn extra marks for your Psychology course(s) this term by participating in studies ...</strong></i></p><ul><li>You will earn "credits" which will be converted to "marks" (1 credit = 1%)</li><li>You can schedule your studies using the "Sona" website.</li></ul><p><i><strong>Educational focus of participation in research</strong></i></p><p>To maximize the educational benefits of participating in research, students will receive feedback information following their participation in each study detailing the following elements:</p><ul><li>Purpose or objectives of the study</li><li>Dependent and independent variables</li><li>Expected results</li><li>References for at least two related research articles</li><li>Provisions to ensure confidentiality of data</li><li>Contact information of the researcher should the student have further questions about the study</li><li>Contact information for the Director of the Office of Research Ethics should the student wish to learn more about the general ethical issues surrounding research with human participants, or specific questions or concerns about the study in which s/he participated.</li></ul><p>Participation in remotely operated (counts as the same as in-lab) studies has increment values of 0.5 participation credits (grade percentage points) for each 30-minutes of participation. Participation in ONLINE studies is worth .25 credits for each 15-minutes of participation.  Researchers will record student’s participation and at the end of the term the REG Coordinator will provide the course instructor with a credit report of the total credits earned by each student. </p><p><i><strong>How to participate?</strong></i></p><p><strong>Study scheduling, participation and grade assignment is managed using the SONA online system.  All students enrolled in this course have been set up with a SONA account.  You must get started early in the term.</strong></p><p><strong>For instructions on how to log in to your SONA account and for a list of important dates and deadlines please, as soon as possible, go to:</strong></p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/welcome-research-experiences-group-and-sona/sona-information">Participating/SONA information:  How to log in to Sona and sign up for studies</a></p><p><i>*** Please do not ask the Course Instructor or REG Coordinator for information unless you have first thoroughly read the information provided on this website.***</i></p><p>More information about the REG program in general is available at: <br/><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/welcome-research-experiences-group-and-sona/sona-information">Sona Information on the REG Participants website</a> or you can check the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/sites/ca.research-experiences-group/files/uploads/files/sona_faq_for_fall_2019.pdf">Sona FAQ on the REG website homepage</a> for additional information. </p><p><strong>Option 2: Article Review as an alternative to participation in research</strong></p><p>Students are not required to participate in research, and not all students wish to do so. As an alternative, students may opt to gain research experience by writing short reviews (1½ to 2 pages) of research articles relevant to the course. The course instructor will specify a suitable source of articles for this course (i.e., scientific journals, newspapers, magazines, other printed media). <i>You must contact your TA to get approval for the article you have chosen before writing the review. </i>Each review article counts as one percentage point. To receive credit, you must follow specific guidelines. The article review must:</p><ul><li><strong>Be submitted before the </strong><a href="http://www.quest.uwaterloo.ca/undergraduate/dates.html">last day of lectures</a><strong>. Late submissions will NOT be accepted under ANY circumstances.</strong></li><li>Be typed</li><li>Fully identify the title, author(s), source and date of the article. A copy of the article must be attached.</li><li>Identify the psychological concepts in the article and indicate the pages in the textbook that are applicable. Critically evaluate the application or treatment of those concepts in the article. If inappropriate or incorrect, identify the error and its implications for the validity of the article. You may find, for example, misleading headings, faulty research procedures, alternative explanations that are ignored, failures to distinguish factual findings from opinions, faulty statements of cause-effect relations, errors in reasoning, etc. Provide examples whenever possible.</li><li>Clearly evaluate the application or treatment of those concepts in the article.</li><li>Keep a copy of your review in the unlikely event we misplace the original.</li></ul><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills in writing, analysis, and communication.  Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document.
