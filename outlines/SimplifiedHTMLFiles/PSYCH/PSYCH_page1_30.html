<div>
<div>
<div>PSYCH 417:</div>
<p>Through training attention via mindfulness, this course provides a deeper personal and general understanding of stress, stress reactivity, adaptive stress responses, and wellness. Experiential learning will be central: students will participate in guided mindfulness practices in class and use the support and structure of the course to develop and maintain a daily mindfulness practice at home. Reflections on personal experience, rooted in both scientific and meditative inquiry, will enrich experiential learning.</p>

<h2>Course Content and Experiential Approach to Learning</h2><p>I am looking forward to embarking on this journey in mindfulness with you this term! This course will likely be quite different from other academic courses you have taken in that it will revolve primarily around an experiential practice: that of mindfulness. </p><p>Mindfulness entails “paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally to the unfolding of experience moment by moment” (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). Although there is no sought-after outcome when we practice mindfulness, the practice of training attention via mindfulness gives rise to greater awareness of our habitual mental, physical, and emotional reactions, including the ways in which these reactions can create stress reactions and various forms of psychological suffering such as those studied and treated in the field of clinical psychology. Mindfulness can also give rise to momentary understandings of how we can experience reduced stress and improved mental health.<br/><br/>Mindfulness practice is an experiential approach, and thus the course will be experiential meaning that we will learn about mindfulness by practicing it ourselves and reflecting on our experiences. The practices and reflections we will engage in derive from the well-established, empirically supported Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn. <u>Although I have provided weekly readings for this course on LEARN, these are meant to be secondary to your own direct learning about mindfulness through daily practice</u>. This experiential and less analytical approach to learning may feel foreign and uncomfortable, and you might feel resistant and skeptical. That is okay! These reactions are part of the range of inner experiences we will be paying attention to with curiosity and non-judgment throughout the course. </p><h4>What to Expect from Class Time and Home Assignments in this Course </h4><p>Both in-class and at home, students will engage in formal mindfulness practices guided by the instructor or and/or by another meditation instructor via audio recordings. In these practices, you will be guided to pay attention to various aspects of your internal experience, including your breath, body sensations, emotions, thoughts, behavioural urges, and behaviours. These practices will sometimes occur while seated and at other times while engaging in gentle stretch-like movements. Gentle movement meditations can be performed sitting down or standing and certain home practices can be performed lying down if desired. We will begin with shorter practices of roughly 5 minutes together in class, and gradually extend the length of the practices to 20-30 minutes. Sample practices can be found on LEARN. </p><p>Class time will typically center around mindfulness practices that we will engage in together as a group. Class will also involve self-reflection and inquiry-based discussion after each mindfulness practice, in smaller groups and as a full class. During the mindfulness practices and at other times specified by the instructor, you will be asked to put away non-essential technology to facilitate deeper learning. Weekly home assignments will primarily revolve around daily mindfulness practice and reflection.</p><p><i>Silent Retreat Class. </i>One of our allotted class times will consist of a “silent retreat” which is a key element of the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program. During this class, the entire three hours will consist of a series of ~20- to 30-minute mindfulness practices, with short breaks interspersed. Students will be asked to be silent throughout this class, and to refrain from all forms of communication and technology during the duration of the class. </p><h4>Distinguishing this Course from Psychotherapy and Counselling</h4><p><i>Not counselling/psychotherapy. </i>Although this course is being taught by a psychologist, this is an academic course, not a form of psychotherapy or a support group, nor is it a substitute for psychotherapy/counselling or medical treatment. If students are experiencing current mental health struggles (e.g., depression, anxiety, trauma symptoms), it is their responsibility to ensure this is an appropriate course for them to take at this time, and they are encouraged to seek guidance and services from a health or mental health professional outside of the course. </p><p><i>Not a form of training to provide counselling/psychotherapy. </i>This course does not provide training in the delivery of psychotherapy or counselling. At the end of this course, students should <i>not </i>consider themselves qualified to offer psychological counselling or to teach mindfulness.</p><p><i>Relationship with course instructor, teaching assistant and other students. </i>Although psychological material will be explored through this course, the relationship between the student and instructor is one of instructor-student and not therapist-client. The same goes for the student-TA relationship. Students who enroll in the course and experience distress should not seek counselling from the instructor or from other classmates but instead should seek out other mental health supports. The instructor is happy to provide recommendations if desired.</p><p> </p><h2>Benefits, Risks and Student Suitability</h2><h4>Benefits</h4><p>There is an extensive research body documenting the benefits of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programs, which will comprise the experiential basis for mindfulness practice in Psych 417.  Specifically, systematic reviews of research studies have found that at the end of an 8-week MBSR group program, participants typically report greater physical and mental well-being including reduced stress (self-reported and via physiological markers), anxiety, depression, pain, and distress, and increased quality of life (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399903005737">Grossman et al., 2004</a>; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002239991500080X">Khoury et al., 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395617301462">Pascoe et al., 2017</a>). Moreover, the benefits participants derive from mindfulness-based programs are greater the more time they spend engaging in at-home mindfulness practices (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796717300979">Parsons et al., 2017</a>). It is nevertheless impossible to guarantee that you will experience personal benefits from the practice of mindfulness through this course. </p><h4>Risks</h4><p>The practice of mindfulness involves paying attention to our internal experiences in ways that may feel unfamiliar. When we carve out space and time away from our devices and usual distractions and pay attention to what experiences arise in us, we can often find ourselves surprised by what we notice. We may find we are experiencing emotions, thinking patterns, urges, and physical sensations that we had no idea were present. This greater awareness that mindfulness practice facilitates can sometimes result in feelings of emotional distress and physical discomfort. Indeed, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10503307.2021.1933646">research</a> has found that over the course of mindfulness meditation practice, some individuals may experience adverse events, with the most common being increased anxiety, the re-experiencing of traumatic symptoms, and heightened emotional sensitivity (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10503307.2021.1933646">Goldberg et al., 2021</a>). Although the instructor will provide guidelines for how students can keep uncomfortable emotions and sensations within a personally tolerable range, it is important to note that you will probably experience some emotional and physical discomfort throughout the course.</p><p><i><strong>Strategies to Mitigate Risks.</strong> </i>At the start of the course, we will be reviewing what Dr. Dan Siegel termed the ‘<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881109354930#fig1-0269881109354930">Window of Tolerance</a>’ which organizes our experience into those that are within vs outside our window of tolerance. When we are within our window of tolerance, we feel grounded, flexible, curious/open, present, and able to emotionally self-regulate. When we are outside our window of tolerance, we may experience hyper-arousal (e.g., high energy, anxiety, anger, overwhelm) or hypo-arousal (e.g., numb, withdrawn, frozen, shut down). In this course, we will be making a commitment to paying attention to how well we are tolerating the experiences arising for us during mindfulness practice and to using strategies to keep us within our windows of tolerance. Each student will also be guided to identify, in advance, signs that might indicate to them that they are outside of their window of tolerance and to devise a list of strategies they can use in those moments to help themselves feel safe. Strategies might include: opening eyes; taking slow breaths with longer exhales; drinking a glass of water; naming five things you can see, hear and feel; standing up and feeling one’s feet on the ground; focusing on something that feels safe like a particular sound, visual, or part of the body; or mindfully leaving the classroom for a few minutes (while signaling this to the instructor and/or teaching assistant). It should be noted that the students are responsible for attending to and taking care of their own well-being and for connecting with professional counselling and/or crisis supports if they begin to feel emotionally and/or physically unwell during course activities. </p><p><i><strong>Accessibility. </strong></i>Students will be provided with options regarding how to slightly alter practices to accommodate their physical and emotional needs. For example, you will be able to sit rather than stand, if desired, and will be permitted to end a practice early if they feel it is too long to tolerate safely. Students will also be provided with a recommended mindfulness practice to perform at home on a given week (e.g., body scan), but have permission to perform a different practice (e.g., sitting meditation) should they feel unable to commit to the one that is assigned. All practices share the focus on cultivating a particular way of paying attention to our experiences, and so it is okay if a student feels the need to omit one type of practice in favour of another that feels more tolerable for them to engage in. Students will not need to seek instructor permission to make these adjustments.</p><h4>Student Suitability</h4><p>Because this course is taking place in an academic, non-clinical setting, students who are <u>currently experiencing</u> any of the following mental health challenges should give careful thought as to whether now is the best time for them to undertake this course. The risks of participating in mindfulness-based programs may be greater for individuals who are presently experiencing the mental health challenges below which is not an exhaustive list (Woods &amp; Rockman, 2021).  </p><ul><li>Very low mood or depression</li><li>Severe anxiety</li><li>Recurrent, strong emotional reactions that are proving difficult to manage</li><li>Hallucinations (auditory or visual)</li><li>Suicidal or homicidal thoughts or actions</li><li>Current symptoms related to trauma like flashbacks</li><li>Recent traumatic experience</li><li>Significant drug or alcohol use</li></ul><p>If you are experiencing current mental health challenges, it would be wise to discuss your participation in this course with a mental health provider (e.g., therapist, counsellor, psychologist), and ensure you have access to them over the course of your enrollment in the course.</p><h2>Class Conduct and Communication Guidelines</h2><p>Mindfulness practices and discussions will take place in-class and thus require that we all be aware of certain guidelines that support everyone’s physical and psychological safety to the best of our abilities. Although this is not an exhaustive list, and we will be generating our own personalized community guidelines together in class, it is recommended that all students participating in the class do their best to commit to the following guidelines adapted from the international virtual mindfulness practice community, Cloud Sangha:</p><ul><li>Conduct ourselves in a respectful and conscientious manner, which includes putting away electronic devices when asked to by the instructor and fully listening to others who are speaking.</li><li>Respect the rights and dignity of the instructor, teaching assistant, and students regardless of their age, race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, country of origin, religion, first language, and so on.</li><li>Treat any personal information shared in the class, by the instructor and fellow students, as confidential.</li><li>Commit to authentic, respectful, and mindful communication.</li><li>Conduct ourselves in a way that encourages open communication.</li></ul><p>Appropriate group conduct includes:</p><ul><li>Sharing from our own personal experience</li><li>Listening mindfully to what others have shared</li></ul><p>Inappropriate group conduct includes:</p><ul><li>Offering commentary, interpretation, or advice to others</li><li>Mentioning or discussing self-harm or bringing harm to others</li><li>Asking the instructor, TA, or classmates for support or help with personal crises</li><li>Regular absences from class (unless there are extenuating circumstances)</li></ul><p>Boundaries around topics of discussion:</p><ul><li>Because of the academic, non-clinical nature of our course, this class is not a place in which to discuss and try to process active mental illness and trauma. Students who are undergoing these experiences are encouraged to receive support from an outside mental health provider.</li><li>The course instructor reserves the right to redirect a student elsewhere if she believes that participation in the course may be harmful to the student and/or to other members of the class community (other students, the instructor, the teaching assistant).</li></ul><p><strong>Please ensure you review the Information and Consent Letter posted on LEARN</strong>.</p>

<h2><strong>Assessment/Grading Philosophy</strong></h2><p>I would encourage you to adopt a learning orientation through this course, rather than a performance orientation. In other words, try to approach this course and the mindfulness practices, reflections and discussions with a relaxed, patient interest in discovery rather than a driven, goal-oriented focus on achieving a certain grade, coming across a certain way in class, and/or experiencing certain benefits. The act of striving toward a particular outcome undermines our capacity to be present to the learning that unfolds naturally and experientially. I have set up the assessment structure to try and support this learning orientation, as outlined below in the Assessment section. </p><p>Although you will have a richer experience in this course if you approach it with a learning orientation <i>without</i> a focus on outcomes, this is an academic course in which grades ultimately need to be assigned. I have therefore given careful thought to developing an assessment method that supports the philosophy and experiential learning focus of the course. The focus of assessment will be primarily on your level of <strong>mindful engagement</strong> with the course which refers to your level of <strong>openness to learning, authenticity, and curiosity</strong> vis-à-vis your own personal experiences with mindfulness practices, as well as your attempts to be <strong>attentive, respectful, and open</strong> in class when speaking, when listening to others, and when engaging in self-reflection. </p><p>Because you are most intimately acquainted with your level of curiosity, openness, and engagement in course material, <strong>self-assessment will form a key part of the assessment method for the course</strong>. Self-assessment will occur at the middle and end of the course rather than every week to remove a focus on micro-analyzing and performance. The instructor and TA will consider the self-assessments you provide and will provide a final grade taking into account your self-assessment and their own assessment taking into account the grading scheme and rubrics, and their review of all students in the course.</p><h2><strong>Assessment Breakdown</strong></h2><p><strong>1. Brief start of course self-introduction and reflection (3% - pass/fail) </strong></p><p>INSTRUCTIONS: Please create a short 3–4-minute video of yourself in which you briefly introduce yourself to me and share with me about some of the following about your hopes and apprehensions for the course and experiences with mindfulness, if any. See questions below for some things you can try to address; if there are questions you do not feel comfortable answering/sharing with me, you can skip those but are invited to reflect for yourself. Although my preference is for you to complete this assignment as a short 3–4-minute video, you may choose to do this assessment via writing (max 500 words) or audio (3-4 minutes) if you are truly not comfortable with video. Please do not spend much time on this assignment! It is really meant to be an opportunity to briefly reflect and for me to get to know each of you and learn your names/faces. It is not a ‘performance’ or something to be perfectionistic about. If you choose to do this as a written or audio assignment, please also upload a picture of yourself (where your face is prominent) to help me learn who you are. 😊</p><ul><li>What is your full name? What pronouns do you use?</li><li>Tell me a bit about yourself including a bit about your professional/academic interests and aspirations.</li><li>What made you sign up for this course? What are you most hoping to gain from it?</li><li>What are your biggest worries and apprehensions in taking this course?</li><li>What experience, if any, have you had with formal mindfulness practices like meditation, mindful movement (e.g., tai-chi, qigong), and mindful yoga? Briefly describe nature and amount of experience as relevant, as well as the format (e.g., in person, App, etc) and context (e.g., secular, religious, spiritual).<ul><li>If you have had experience practicing mindfulness, what have you found challenging? How have you managed those challenges, if at all? </li><li>If you have had experience practicing mindfulness, what if anything have you found beneficial?</li></ul></li><li>Some other things you may choose to address:<ul><li>What are your current methods for coping with stress?</li><li>Is religion and/or spirituality a part of your life? If so, please describe briefly.</li><li>What experience, if any, have you had with informal mindfulness practices, like trying to immerse yourself in the full sensory experience of a particular situation or activity (e.g., feeling the water on your hands while washing the dishes, noticing the smell of the flowers while outside) without doing or thinking about something else at the same time?</li></ul></li></ul><p>GRADING:</p><ul><li>This assignment will be assessed in a pass/fail manner. You will receive a full 3% for completing this assignment and submitting it on time. You will lose .5% for every hour it is late, up to a maximum of 1.5%.</li></ul><p>DEADLINE:</p><ul><li>The assignment is due on Monday, Jan 20 at 11am. The Dropbox will be open until noon for a one-hour grace window.</li></ul><h4><strong>2. Class Attendance, Punctuality, and Mindful Engagement (40%)</strong></h4><p>INSTRUCTIONS: Regular and engaged participation in in-person class activities (mindfulness practices, inquiry periods, discussions) are essential for you to experience the learning intended for this course. Arriving on time and staying for the full duration of each class is important for the course learning objective of mindful conduct and will ensure that you do not miss important learning activities which build on each other in systematic ways. Because this is an experientially-focused class that revolves heavily around the practice of mindfulness, and in which each class builds upon another in terms of skills and understandings developed, class attendance is essential for this course. It is through being in class with guidance from the instructor and inquiry-based discussion periods with the class that students will come to learn to engaging in mindfulness practice safely and to bring curiosity to and learn from their experience, thus forming the basis for them to be able to practice mindfulness and inquire about their experiences outside of the class. The weekly checkpoint and communal practice help students to share and address challenges and clarify understandings in important ways. Thus, if you have concerns about your capacity to commit to weekly class attendance (barring illness or significantly extenuating life circumstances), then this course may not be for you unfortunately.</p><p> </p><p>GRADING: Given its importance, the attendance portion of the course will be weighted 40%. You will receive a grade for attendance-punctuality-engagement on two occasions during the term: (1) after MBSR class 4; and (2) at the end of the course. Grades will be based on both objective information and subjective self-perceptions. Your presence/absence, punctuality, and complete class attendance will be noted each week in an objective fashion based on whether you are present for the whole class and on time and will be compiled into an attendance/punctuality grade at each of the two grading occasions. Please note that attendance at each regular MBSR class will be weighted 2.5% whereas attendance at the retreat will be weighted 5% as will attendance at the final closing circle class. This is because learning objectives are addressed in greater depth in these two classes. At the two grading occasions (after MBSR class 4 and at the end of the course), you will also complete a self-assessment/self-reflection on your level of mindful engagement during in-person classes over the preceding weeks in a global way (rather than class-by-class). The grade you receive for mindful engagement will derive in large part from your own self-reflections using the rubric and comment boxes. A summary of the grading breakdown is below and you can see LEARN for the more detailed self-assessment rubric.</p><ul><li><strong>15% </strong><i>MBSR classes 1-4 à</i> 10% attendance + punctuality (2.5% per week assigned objectively); 5% mindful engagement (assessed globally after the four classes based on self-reflection and instructor/TA assessment)</li><li><strong>15% </strong><i>MBSR classes 5-8 à</i> 10% attendance + punctuality (2.5% per week assigned objectively); 5% mindful engagement (assessed globally after the four classes based on self-reflection and instructor/TA assessment)</li><li><strong>5% </strong><i>MBSR retreat class à</i><strong> </strong>5% which includes attendance + punctuality + mindful engagement  </li><li><strong>5% </strong><i>final class with closing sharing circle à</i><strong> </strong>5% which includes attendance + punctuality + mindful engagement</li></ul><p> </p><p>DEADLINES TO SUBMIT SELF-ASSESSMENT:</p><ul><li>Submit self-assessment #1 by Feb 11</li><li>Submit self-assessment #2 by March 25</li><li>NOTE: You have 2 slip days to use over the term for these self-assessments.</li></ul><p> </p><h4><strong>3. Formal Daily Practice and Weekly Practice Logs and Reflections – 30%</strong></h4><p> </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS: An essential part of the MBSR curriculum and of this course is daily formal mindfulness practice. Each week, certain practices will be uploaded onto LEARN for you to practice daily. You will have freedom to choose shorter lengths of practices as needed to support your capacity to establish a daily practice. A variety of practices will be available over the course of the MBSR curriculum. (Please see the course Information and Consent Letter for more information.) To support your engagement in and learning from daily formal mindfulness practice outside of the class, you will be asked to complete a weekly practice log during which you track the types and durations of your daily practices and will also be asked to engage in brief written reflections for three formal practices per week during which you comment on the inner experiences that arose for you during the practice (e.g., wandering mind, restlessness, chest tension, peaceful feelings). You will submit your completed weekly log/reflection document each week and will receive grades on your practice engagement and log/reflection completion on two occasions in the course: (1) after MBSR class 4 (based on MBSR weeks 1-4, worth 13%); and (2) at the end of the course (based on MBSR weeks 5-8 + retreat week, worth 17%). </p><p> </p><p>GRADING: The grades you receive will be based partly on objective factors and partly on your subjective self-assessment/self-reflection using the relevant rubric and comment boxes (see LEARN for detailed rubric); the general breakdown of your grade at the two assessment points will be broken down as follows, with <strong>13%</strong> of your course grade coming from MBSR weeks 1-4 and <strong>17%</strong> from MBSR weeks 5-8 + retreat week:</p><ul><li>1/3 for consistently following assignment instructions: submitting weekly reflections on time, completing the log, completing at least 3 reflections on 3 separate days of formal mindfulness practice</li><li>1/3 for consistent and committed daily formal mindfulness practice </li><li>1/3 for authenticity and mindful engagement in practice and practice reflections</li></ul><p> </p><p>WEEKLY DEADLINE:</p><ul><li>Tuesdays, 11am (so I have a chance to review before the class)</li><li>You have 1 slip day during the entire term for these weekly reflections.</li></ul><p> </p><p>DEADLINE:</p><ul><li>Submit self-assessment #1 by Feb 11</li><li>Submit self-assessment #2 by March 25</li><li>NOTE: You have 2 slip days to use over the term for these self-assessments.</li></ul><p> </p><h4><strong>4. Additional Home Assignments: Weekly Reading, Handouts, Informal Practices – 10%</strong></h4><p> </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS: To further support your learning, there will be weekly readings, handouts, and tasks that you can engage with to the extent that you are able. These are secondary to the formal mindfulness practices and reflections, and so are weighted significantly less and will not be assessed in a strict, detailed manner. Rather, each week in class during the discussion, there will be an opportunity in small groups or the large group to talk about experiences with these home assignments/readings and to share about one’s learning.</p><p> </p><p>GRADING: Your grade will be based primarily on self-assessment on two occasions during the term: (1) after MBSR class 4 (worth 4%); and (2) at the end of the course (worth 6%). You will be asked to reflect on your level of consistent weekly engagement with these additional home assignments, to share comments for the instructor about your experiences/involvement with these tasks, and to suggest a grade for yourself for the preceding section on the course. The instructor and TA will take your perceptions into account and assign a final grade weighing both your perceptions and theirs. The recommended grading scheme is below and in the rubric on LEARN:</p><ul><li>5/5 if on average across the relevant weeks, you engaged with 3 of these 3 things</li><li>4/5 if on average across the relevant weeks, you engaged with 2 of these 3 things</li><li>3/5 if on average across the relevant weeks, you engaged with 1 of these 3 things</li><li>&lt;2/5 if on average, across the relevant weeks, you engaged in less than 1 of these things</li></ul><p> </p><p>DEADLINE:</p><ul><li>Submit self-assessment #1 by Feb 11</li><li>Submit self-assessment #2 by March 25</li><li>NOTE: You have 2 slip days to use over the term for these self-assessments.</li></ul><p> </p><h4><strong>5. End-of-course reflection (15%) </strong></h4><p> </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS: In the 2-3 weeks leading up to the last class of the course, you will be asked to take some time to reflect on your experiences in this mindfulness course and what you have learned during this time through your journey in mindfulness. You will be asked to respond to the questions below genuinely as possible (with your responses totaling 4-6 pages double spaced.</p><ol><li>What expectations did you have about practicing mindfulness at the start of the course? Do you have a different picture of mindfulness practice now than what you had before you began the course? Please explain what changed for you and the process through which any changes unfolded.</li><li>What did you learn from participating in mindfulness practice, and reflections on practice, throughout this course? Please comment on anything you learned, including about the factors that contribute to stress and psychological distress in your life and the factors that contribute to your personal wellness and well-being drawing primarily on your personal practice reflections. You may integrate some of what you learned through course readings as well. </li><li>Did anything about your experiences and learnings in this course surprise you? If so, what? </li><li>How have you been challenged by this course and the practice of mindfulness? What were the most difficult parts of practicing mindfulness for you? Please describe drawing on your personal experiences.</li><li>What were the most satisfying parts of practicing mindfulness for you? Please explain.</li><li>Please describe an anecdote where you noticed yourself applying mindfulness in your life over the past term. </li><li>Has this course changed you in any way? If yes, how? </li><li>Is there anything you are doing differently lately as compared to before the course started. If so, please describe what that is and share an instance that captures this. You might reflect on how you are coping with stress and difficulties in your life differently, differences in the way you are interacting with others, or whatever else comes up for you. If you do not feel you are doing anything differently, you may comment on intentions you may have for how to approach certain experiences in your life differently moving forward, even if you do not perceive changes yet.</li><li>Describe what you have learned about yourself as a result of your engagement in this course. </li><li>Are there are other things that you have not discussed in answering the questions above that feel important to discuss as you reflect on your experiences in this course?</li></ol><p> </p><p>GRADING: This assignment will be graded via self-assessment/self-reflection, together with instructor and TA input, on evidence of mindful engagement and curiosity; experiential learning; authenticity; learning transfer; and reflection and openness. See detailed rubric on LEARN.</p><p> </p><p>DEADLINE: </p><ul><li>Submit reflection paper by March 25</li><li>Submit self-assessment on reflection paper by March 25</li><li>SLIIP DAYS: You may use up to 2 slip days for this assignment.</li></ul><p> </p><h4><strong>6. SONA Participation and Research Experience (2%)</strong></h4><p> </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS: Because this course is less academic than most, 2% of your mark will come from research participation via SONA. See details below.</p><p>Experiential learning is considered an integral part of the undergraduate program in Psychology. Research participation is one example of this, article review is another. A number of undergraduate courses have been expanded to include opportunities for Psychology students to earn grades while gaining research experience.</p><p>Since experiential learning is highly valued in the Department of Psychology, students may earn up to 2% of their final mark in this course through research experience (i.e., course work will make up 98% of the final mark and research experience will make up the other 2% for a maximum grade of 100%). <strong>Be sure to review the guidelines referred to later in this document.</strong></p><p>The two options for earning research experience grades; participation in research through online remotely operated and In Lab studies, as well as article review; are described below. Students may complete any combination of these options to earn research experience grades. Credits will be permitted to be earned with half from online, and the other half (1.0) from In-lab or Remote Access studies.</p><p><strong>Option 1:  Participation in Psychology Research</strong></p><p>Research participation is coordinated by the Research Experiences Group (REG). Psychology students may volunteer as research participants in remotely operated, In Lab and/or online (web-based) studies conducted by students and faculty in the Department of Psychology. Participation enables students to learn first-hand about psychology research and related concepts. Many students report that participation in research is both an educational and interesting experience.

Some technologies may also provide a recording indicator. Images, audio, text/chat messaging that have been recorded may be used and/or made available by the University to Blakie Sahay, OT Reg, who is mentoring the course instructor in her teaching of mindfulness. Recordings will be managed according to the University records classification scheme, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/records-management/records-classification-and-retention-schedules"><u>WatClass</u></a>, and will be securely destroyed when no longer needed by the University. Your personal information is protected in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31"><u>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</u></a>, as well as <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/privacy/"><u>University policies and guidelines</u></a> and may be subject to disclosure where required by law.</p><p>The University will use reasonable means to protect the security and confidentiality of the recorded information, but cannot provide a guarantee of such due to factors beyond the University’s control, such as recordings being forwarded, copied, intercepted, circulated, disclosed, or stored without the University’s knowledge or permission or the introduction of malware into computer system which could potentially damage or disrupt the computer, networks, and security settings. The University is not responsible for connectivity/technical difficulties or loss of data associated with your hardware, software or Internet connection.</p><p>By engaging in course activities that involve recording, you are consenting to the use of your voice and/or likeness in the manner and under the conditions specified herein. If you choose not to be recorded, this notice serves as confirmation of your understanding that you must refrain from speaking in large-group class discussions. </p><p>You are not permitted to disclose the link to/URL of an event or an event session recording or copies of recording to anyone, for any reason. Recordings are available only to authorized individuals who have been directly provided the above instructions/link for their use. Recordings for personal use, required to facilitate your learning and preparation of personal course/lecture notes, should not be shared with others without the permission of the instructor or event coordinator. Review the University’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>guidelines for faculty, staff and students entering relationships with external organizations offering access to course materials</u></a> for more information on your obligations with respect to keeping copies of course materials. For more information about accessibility, connect with <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a>.</p><h2>Confidentiality and Privacy</h2><p>The College of Psychologists includes teaching of a psychological nature by a member of the College to be a ‘psychological service,’ particularly when there are exchanges between students and the instructor regarding personal information, such as about experiences that arise during the practice of mindfulness. Therefore, the instructor, who is a registered psychologist, is required to keep brief notes about the discussions that take place in the Psych 417 class. The notes will be saved in password-protected documents on the instructor’s password-protected University of Waterloo server. No one else will have access to these notes and they will be kept confidential except under the circumstances outlined below when the instructor is professionally and legally obligated to breach confidentiality by their College.</p><ol><li>If anything makes the instructor believe that you are an imminent danger to yourself or to someone else, they will be required to contact the authorities or others who can intervene to help prevent harm to you or others, and any intended victims of harm;</li><li>If the instructor learns that you have been sexually abused by another registered health provider, they will have to report what they know; however, the instructor will not give your name without your written permission;</li><li>If the instructor suspects or is informed that a child is at risk of being harmed in any way (e.g., sexual or physical abuse, negligence), they must contact Child and Family Services and report all relevant information;</li><li>If the contents of the instructor’s course notes are ordered by a court of law, the instructor is required to release the file to the court;</li><li>If College of Psychologists of Ontario, as part of a random review, requests access to the notes taken on each class for the purposes of assuring quality of care, the instructor is obligated to allow them that access; </li><li>If the instructor becomes aware of abuse (including financial abuse) of someone in care at along-term care facility (e.g., nursing home) or retirement home, they are required to contact the Ministry of Health; or</li><li>If law enforcement officers request access to the class notes because they believe the information will assist in finding a missing person, under the Missing Persons Act (2018), the instructor is obligated to allow them access.</li></ol><p>In this course, students will be invited to share observations about their mindfulness practice through synchronous discussions in class. All students will also be required to share brief written reflections with the instructor and teaching assistant (TA) as part of the course assignments. Students should follow the instructor’s guidelines and prompts regarding reflection to maximize the chances that information shared is tied to the practice of mindfulness. Following these guidelines will also help to minimize the chances of students sharing overly personal, emotionally charged information that is less directly related to the mindfulness practice and that may have the potential to trigger distress in them and other students in the class. It is nevertheless possible that emotionally vulnerable material will arise and be shared. In all cases of sharing – non-verbal, oral, and written – the instructor and TA will keep what is shared confidential unless your explicit consent has been communicated or if what you shared requires the instructor to breach confidentiality as required by the College of Psychologists of Ontario, detailed above. It should be noted that although all students in the class will be encouraged to keep in-class discussions confidential, the instructor is not able to oversee what is done outside of class time and cannot enforce this broader confidentiality. </p>

<h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>I, the instructor, and the University of Waterloo respectfully acknowledge that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous"><u>Office of Indigenous Relations</u></a><u>.</u></p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as mindfulness and reflection on personal experience. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is<strong> not permitted in this class. </strong>Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
