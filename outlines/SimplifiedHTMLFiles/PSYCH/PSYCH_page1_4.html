<p>Psychology 101 is designed to provide you with an understanding of the basic concepts, theories, and methods of modern psychology as a behavioural science. The field is diverse, covering a broad range of topics such as neuroscience, human development, learning and memory, the social forces that affect behaviour, mental disorders and treatment, and many more. Based on those topics, I expect that you will develop a more thorough understanding of yourself and the world that you live in. But since psychology is in essence the study of our human experience, I’ll also expect that each of you is coming into this course with some intuitive assumptions about the field. You will find that many of your beliefs about human existence are scientifically supported; but you will also find many beliefs are refuted by the evidence. Therefore, another goal of this course will be to encourage you to think critically about your preconceptions so that you can become a better consumer of the psychological information that is available in the world, and especially the media.</p>

<h3>Midterm Tests and Final Exam</h3><p>There are two midterms, which will be completed in class (in our regular classroom at the regular time). Midterm tests cover material equally from both lecture and assigned readings and consist of multiple choice questions. Midterms are NOT cumulative. Because test-taking can be stressful for students, particularly when tests make up a large portion of you grade, you will have the opportunity to "retake" each of these midterms with new questions at the end of the term. If you do worse on the test retake, your grade will not be affected. However, if you do better on the test retake, I will take the average of your two grades for each midterm (the average of your original test grade and your test retake grade). Please note that you have to have written the in-class midterms in order to take advantage of the test retake option. If you did not write the original midterms, you will not be able to complete the test retakes. </p><p><i>GUIDELINES FOR MISSED TESTS: </i>Make-up tests are only permitted for students who have a valid medical or personal emergency; travel plans or other personal or academic commitments are not considered valid reasons for missing a test. If you must miss a test for a valid reason, complete an absence declaration through Quest and <strong>email Dr. McCarthy and the head TA <u>before the scheduled test</u> to arrange a make-up test. </strong>If you email after missing the test, you must do so within 48 hours of the test or you will receive a zero, even with medical documentation (except in rare circumstances where your condition made it impossible to notify an instructor). </p><p>The final exam will be completed during the final exam period and will consist of multiple choice questions. The exam is NOT cumulative and will only include material that we covered since Midterm 2. There is no make-up exam available for those who miss the scheduled exam date. Students who miss the exam for a valid, documented medical reason will receive an INC and will write the exam in the next term in which the course is offered. </p><h3>Self-Analysis Paper </h3><p>How can the concepts we discuss in class help you to understand your own life and experiences? For this assignment you will have the opportunity to complete a variety of measures of psychological variables (e.g., personality traits, optimism, social connectedness, etc.) and consider the role that these variables have had in your own life as well as the validity of the measures themselves. You will first complete the measures via an anonymous online survey and have a chance to view and reflect on your scores. Your task will then be to select one variable to focus on and write a short paper that critically evaluates the measure itself (do you think this is a reliable and valid measure of this variable?) and reflects on the concept being measured and how you think it has impacted your own life. You should include at least two references as part of your assessment of this variable—one can be the textbook or lecture notes and the second should be from a psychological journal. Full instructions will be available on Learn. </p><p><i>GUIDELINES FOR LATE SUBMISSIONS: </i>Late submissions for the written assignments will be penalized 5% per day up to a maximum of 50%. After 10 days, late submissions will not be accepted. If you have a legitimate reason for a late submission (such as an illness or family emergency) please <strong>email Dr. McCarthy and your specific TA <u>before the assignment deadline</u></strong>. If you email us after the assignment deadline, you must do so within 48 hours or you will receive a grade of zero. If you have other compelling circumstances for a late submission, it is possible that extensions may be granted if you contact us before the assignment deadline. </p><h3>Application Paper (optional) </h3><p>Students who want to reduce the weight of the tests in this course will have the option to complete an application paper, due at the midpoint of the term. In order to opt in to this alternative grading scheme (option B, listed above), all you have to do is submit the application paper by the due date; you don't need to contact us to let us know. Once you submit the application paper, you will automatically convert to the alternative grading scheme. Please note that<strong> you</strong> <strong>cannot undo this choice later</strong> (e.g., if you are unhappy with your grade on the application paper). </p><p>For this assignment you will choose a real world example of a human behaviour, experience, or phenomenon and write a short paper analyzing this example from a psychological perspective. For example, you may want to analyze why your classmates seem to fall asleep during afternoon lectures or why vaping has risen in popularity. Your task will be to select at least one course concept to apply to this example  provide a critical analysis of how this concept (or concepts, if you choose more than one) can help us to understand it. You will need to include at least two references--one can be the textbook and the second should be from a psychological journal. Full instructions will be available on Learn. </p><h3>Research Experience (SONA)</h3><p>Make sure you read the information below in full! If you have questions about this component of the course,<strong> please contact the REG coordinator (regadmin@uwaterloo.ca)</strong>, NOT Dr. McCarthy or your TAs. Although we would love to help, we aren't involved in the administration of REG/SONA and will not be able to help you. </p><p><strong>Description and Purpose of Research Experience </strong></p><p>Experiential learning is considered an integral part of the undergraduate program in Psychology. Research participation is one example of this, article review is another. A number of undergraduate courses have been expanded to include opportunities for Psychology students to earn grades while gaining research experience.</p><p>Since experiential learning is highly valued in the Department of Psychology, students may earn <strong>up to 4%</strong> of their final mark in this course through research experience (i.e., course work will make up 96% of the final mark and research experience will make up the other 4% for a maximum grade of 100%). In addition, for those students who wish to sample a wider range of these experiences, a further <strong>"bonus" of up to 2%</strong> may be earned and will be added to the final grade if/as needed to bring your final grade up to 100%. <strong>In total, students may add up to 6% to their final grade</strong>.</p><p>The two options for earning research experience grades; participation in research through online, remotely operated and In Lab studies, as well as article review; are described below. <i><strong>Students may complete up to half of the credits through online studies, while the other half will need to be completed through either in lab or remote access studies (similar to In lab but held over video conferencing software. </strong></i></p><p><strong>Option 1: Participation in Psychology Research</strong></p><p>Research participation is coordinated by the Research Experiences Group (REG). Psychology students may volunteer as research participants in remotely operated, In Lab and/or online (web-based) studies conducted by students and faculty in the Department of Psychology. Participation enables students to learn first-hand about psychology research and related concepts. Many students report that participation in research is both an educational and interesting experience. Please be assured that all Psychology studies have been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Board. </p><p><i><strong>How to earn extra marks for your Psychology course(s) this term by participating in studies ...</strong></i></p><ul><li>You will earn "credits" which will be converted to "marks" (1 credit = 1%)</li><li>You can schedule your remotely operated (replacing in-lab) and ONLINE studies using the "Sona" website.</li></ul><p><i><strong>Educational focus of participation in research</strong></i></p><p>To maximize the educational benefits of participating in research, students will receive feedback information following their participation in each study detailing the following elements:</p><ul><li>Purpose or objectives of the study</li><li>Dependent and independent variables</li><li>Expected results</li><li>References for at least two related research articles</li><li>Provisions to ensure confidentiality of data</li><li>Contact information of the researcher should the student have further questions about the study</li><li>Contact information for the Director of the Office of Research Ethics should the student wish to learn more about the general ethical issues surrounding research with human participants, or specific questions or concerns about the study in which s/he participated.</li></ul><p>Participation in remotely operated and in-person in lab studies has increment values of 0.5 participation credits (grade percentage points) for each 30-minutes of participation. Participation in ONLINE studies is worth .25 credits for each 15-minutes of participation.  Researchers will record student’s participation and at the end of the term the REG Coordinator will provide the course instructor with a credit report of the total credits earned by each student.  </p><p><i><strong>How to participate?</strong></i></p><p><strong>Study scheduling, participation and grade assignment is managed using the SONA online system.  All students enrolled in this course have been set up with a SONA account.  You must get started early in the term.</strong></p><p><strong>For instructions on how to log in to your SONA account and for a list of important dates and deadlines please, as soon as possible go to:</strong></p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/">Participating/SONA information: How to log in to Sona and sign up for studies</a></p><p><i>*** Please do not ask the Course Instructor or REG Coordinator for information unless you have first thoroughly read the information provided on this website.***</i></p><p>More information about the REG program in general is available at: <br/><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/welcome-research-experiences-group-and-sona/sona-information">Sona Information on the REG Participants website</a> or you can check the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/welcome-research-experiences-group-and-sona/sona-frequently-asked-questions-faqs">Sona FAQ on the REG website homepage</a> for additional information. </p><p><strong>Option 2: Article Review as an alternative to participation in research</strong></p><p>Students are not required to participate in research, and not all students wish to do so. As an alternative, students may opt to gain research experience by writing short reviews (1½ to 2 pages) of research articles relevant to the course. For those course, please select articles from the scientific journal Psychological Science (available online through the library). <i>You must contact your TA to get approval for the article you have chosen before writing the review. </i>Each review article counts as one percentage point. To receive credit, you must follow specific guidelines. The article review must:</p><ul><li><strong>Be submitted before the </strong><a href="http://www.quest.uwaterloo.ca/undergraduate/dates.html">last day of lectures</a><strong>. Late submissions will NOT be accepted under ANY circumstances.</strong></li><li>Be typed</li><li>Fully identify the title, author(s), source and date of the article. A copy of the article must be attached.</li><li>Identify the psychological concepts in the article and indicate the pages in the textbook that are applicable. Critically evaluate the application or treatment of those concepts in the article. If inappropriate or incorrect, identify the error and its implications for the validity of the article. You may find, for example, misleading headings, faulty research procedures, alternative explanations that are ignored, failures to distinguish factual findings from opinions, faulty statements of cause-effect relations, errors in reasoning, etc. Provide examples whenever possible.</li><li>Clearly evaluate the application or treatment of those concepts in the article.</li><li>Keep a copy of your review in the unlikely event we misplace the original.</li></ul><p> </p>

Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour</u></a> states, as one of its general principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course.
