<h2>What to Expect as a Student</h2><p>Your day-to-day tasks in the course will include:</p><ul><li>Completing independent textbook readings.</li><li>Watching lecture videos and supplementary informational videos.</li><li>Gauging your knowledge with weekly module quizzes.</li><li>Demonstrating your learning through 3 non-cumulative tests spread across the semester.</li><li>Completing a scaffolded written assignment (broken into four milestones across the semester).</li></ul><h2>Course Philosophy and Expectations</h2><p>Online learning offers unique opportunities and advantages in some domains, and occasionally challenges in others. Many students feel quite comfortable in an asynchronous learning environment, while others need to acclimate to the experience. The course team is deeply committed to making this the best learning experience possible for you as students. In the interest of transparency and mutual understanding, below is some information pertaining to the design philosophy for this course.</p><p><i><strong>Independent learning.</strong></i> To make the most of the online learning experience, <strong>it’s important that you complete the assigned readings from the textbook.</strong> In many courses, students feel that completing assigned readings isn’t necessary to succeed in a course, believing that attending lectures or reviewing slides is sufficient. <strong>In an asynchronous learning environment, a commitment to independent study is more critical than ever.</strong> We encourage you not to think of the textbook as a supplemental resource, but as <strong>your primary tool for learning in this course.</strong> The course designers have taken independent study time into account when structuring the course, and have developed lecture videos surveying many of the core concepts to further support your learning. But ultimately, the lecture videos were designed to complement your independent readings, not replace them. As such, we strongly encourage you to complete all assigned readings in order to optimize your experience in the course.</p><p><i><strong>Assessments.</strong></i> The goal of this course is to limit the labor-intensive work you have to do each week and give you the flexibility to fit this course into your schedules however you see fit, while ensuring you have regular prompts to engage with the course’s material. Each module will feature a short quiz (10 items over 15 minutes), keeping you involved in the course on a weekly basis while only amounting for a relatively small portion of your final grade (10% evenly spread over your ten highest quiz grades). The three larger course tests and written assignment deadlines have been spaced out so you can plan out your study/work strategies ahead of time.</p><p><i><strong>Getting through this together.</strong></i> If you find yourself struggling with any aspect of the course or may be in need of accommodation, please don’t hesitate to reach out to the course instructor(s) or your TAs. Also keep in mind that the members of the course team are human beings as well trying their best to make this a positive experience for everyone involved. Remember: politeness and respect go a long way.</p><p> </p>

<h3>Course Policies</h3><h4>Late Work </h4><p> <br/>Missed deadlines for the following assessments will results in an <strong>immediate 0%</strong>:</p><ul><li>Quizzes</li><li>Article submission for approval</li><li>Article review outline</li></ul><p>Missed deadlines for the following assessments will results in a <strong>penalty of 10% per day </strong>(including weekend days):</p><ul><li>Tests</li><li>Article review (final submission)</li></ul><p><br/>In the case of emergency that may result in late submission, please contact the course instructor(s) to discuss potential extensions. If you know or suspect you are going to miss a deadline, please contact your course instructor(s) at least 24 hours in advance. It is much harder to accommodate students after this time.</p><p> </p><h3>Department Policies</h3><h4>Accommodation for Course Requirements </h4><p> <br/>Policies of the Psychology department pertaining to course requirements are available on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/psychology/current-psychology-undergraduate-students/policies"><u>department website</u></a>.</p><p>For security purposes, the Psychology Department does not allow students to write tests, quizzes, or final exams for Psychology courses prior to the date/time scheduled for the course.</p><p>Elective arrangements such as travel plans are not acceptable grounds for granting accommodations to course requirements per the <a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Assignments-Tests-and-Final-Exams"><u>University Policies, Guidelines, and Academic Regulations.</u></a></p><h4>Accommodation requests based on religious/cultural grounds </h4><p>Requests for alternate sittings for tests, quizzes, or final exams based on religious/cultural grounds must be made to the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies for the Faculty of Arts in writing by the following deadlines: </p><ul><li><strong>For final exams</strong>: within one week of the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/exam-schedule"><u>final exam schedule being posted by the Registrar's Office</u></a>.</li><li><strong>For tests or quizzes</strong>: before the 'drop - no penalty period' ends (see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/undergraduate-students/important-dates"><u>Important Dates</u></a>)</li></ul><p><br/>The Associate Dean will contact the instructor on the student's behalf to request an alternate sitting for the test, quiz, or final exam. </p><h4>Concerns about a Course Policy or Decision </h4><p>We in the Psychology Department take great pride in the high quality of our program and our instructors. Though infrequent, we know that students occasionally find themselves in situations of conflict with their instructors over course policies or grade assessments. If such a conflict arises, the Associate Chair for Undergraduate Affairs is available for consultation and to mediate a resolution between the student and instructor.</p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>We acknowledge that we are living and working on the traditional territory of the Attawandaron (also known as Neutral), Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes ten kilometres on each side of the Grand River.</p><p>For more information about the purpose of territorial acknowledgements, please see the <a href="https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory"><u>CAUT Guide to Acknowledging Traditional Territory</u></a>.</p><p>More Indigenization resources at the University of Waterloo:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/"><u>University's Indigenization Strategy website</u></a></li><li>Shatitsirótha’-- the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/stpauls/waterloo-indigenous-student-centre"><u>Waterloo Indigenous Student Centre</u></a></li><li>The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/"><u>Human Rights, Equity, and Inclusion Office</u></a></li></ul><p> </p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>
