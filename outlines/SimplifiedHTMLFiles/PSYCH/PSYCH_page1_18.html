  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>PSYCH 291:</div>
<p>This course introduces the methods used to observe, quantify, summarize, and describe behaviour in empirical psychological science. It focuses on research design and the interpretation of results.</p>

<div>
<p>People are naturally curious about one another's behaviour patterns and their underlying causes. Psychological questions are a popular topic both in everyday conversations and in popular media. For example, we discuss such questions as:</p><ul><li>How can we evaluate whether a new type of therapy is effective for treating psychological disorders?</li><li>How can two people who grew up in the same household sometimes have very different personalities?</li><li>Why do people make decisions that they later regret even though the harmful consequences were foreseeable?</li><li>What determines whether a romantic couple will stay together or break up?</li></ul><p>These examples barely scratch the surface of the questions about human psychology that we wonder about on a daily basis. Research methods encompass the principles and strategies that guide how psychologists collect and interpret information to answer these sorts of questions in order to build an accurate understanding of the mind and behaviour. This course will provide you with an overview of the variety of methods that researchers use to build this knowledge. We will review the rationale for using particular methods and the principles for evaluating the quality of these methods. Though this course is focused on psychological research methods, much of the knowledge you will gain through this course transfers to other domains, outside of academic psychological research.</p><p><strong>In particular this course aims to provide tools that will equip you to</strong></p><ul><li>think more critically about psychological research that you may come across in your studies or through popular media,</li><li>prepare you to conduct well-designed psychological investigations of your own,</li><li>become a more informed and critical consumer of research, and</li><li>be a more effective observer of behaviour in everyday life.</li></ul><h4><strong>Overview of Course Content</strong></h4><p>This course begins with important ethical considerations that first must be considered when conducting research. It touches on methods for generating hypotheses, developing one's skill in generating insightful hypotheses, and assessing the validity of hypotheses. Specifically, this course will provide students with the opportunity to explore important topics and skills in psychological research including how to</p><ul><li>sample behaviour,</li><li>test the reliability and validity of measures,</li><li>design scales that elicit meaningful responses,</li><li>design experiments that effectively test hypotheses about psychological phenomena, and</li><li>assess the relative strengths and limitations of different methodologies including self-report surveys, lab experiments, and field studies.</li></ul><h3><strong>Important Features of the Course</strong></h3><p>This course provides many opportunities to engage with the course material, test your knowledge, build skills, and interact with your peers and instructor.</p><h4><strong>Think and Respond Self-Assessment and Workbook Questions</strong></h4><p>Think and Respond interactive questions and workbook questions are embedded in the learning modules and will provide you with an opportunity to test your knowledge and provide important feedback with content that may not appear elsewhere in the course. These self-assessment questions are a core aspect of this course. For the open response questions (e.g., not multiple choice) you are strongly encouraged to record your answers in the workbook provided. You should then return to the module pages to check your answer. It is critical that you 'click' to check your answer, as this will reveal important feedback, containing content that may not appear elsewhere in the course. Skipping these questions and not checking the feedback will result in missing some core content and knowledge that will be tested in various different graded assessments in this course (i.e., assignments, quizzes, and final examination).</p><h4><strong>Discussions</strong></h4><p>Discussions provide an opportunity to test out ideas and practice using important concepts. Discussion groups will be created with 10-15 students per group. Discussions will be graded, with the expectation that each student make a meaningful contribution to the discussion and respond to other group member's posts. The final examination will also contain a question that pertains to these discussions, so participating throughout the term is highly recommended.</p><h4><strong>Assignments</strong></h4><p>Assignments are designed to assess your understanding of key concepts from the course modules through structured exercises. These assignments will challenge you to apply your understanding of key concepts to complete practical tasks and to evaluate the quality of specific research designs. The completion of these assignments will allow you to put your knowledge into practice and demonstrate your learning of research principles in a variety of ways.</p><h4><strong>End of Module Quizzes</strong></h4><p>End of Module Quizzes are composed of multiple choice questions. These are designed to help keep you on track, assess your learning and provide a lower-stakes opportunity to demonstrate your learning throughout the course.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3><strong>Course Policies</strong></h3><h4><strong>Independent work on assignments and quizzes</strong></h4><p>All quizzes involve independent work. The answers that you submit to quizzes should be your own independent work without any collaboration or discussion with others. If you have questions about any of the content of the quizzes these should be directed to the TAs or the course instructor, not to other students or anyone outside the course. Also, after you complete the quiz it is not permissible to share the answers with other students or anyone else. The quiz contents and answers belong to this course and you may not share or distribute them to others without the instructor's permission.</p><p>It is permissible to discuss the assignments with other students and collaborate with others in developing your thoughts. Indeed, you are encouraged to engage in such collaboration if this will help you to learn the material and reason through the assignment questions. However, the final answers that you submit for each assignment should be composed by you and written in your own words. If identical responses are submitted by different students this will be considered a violation of the course policy and will be marked zero and reported to the Associate Dean following the procedures described in the University Policies section of the syllabus.</p><h4><strong>Deadlines for assignments and quizzes</strong></h4><p>All assignments and quizzes must be submitted by the scheduled deadlines to receive credit. Any assignments or quizzes that are submitted after their scheduled deadlines will not be graded unless an extension was approved by the course instructor to accommodate a documented extenuating circumstance.</p><h4><strong>Accommodation for course requirements</strong></h4><p>Students requesting accommodation for course requirements (assignments, quizzes, final examinations, etc.) due to illness should follow the procedures described in the University Policies section of the syllabus.</p><p><strong>In the case of a missed final examination</strong>, see the accommodations described in 'University Policies' section of the syllabus.</p><p><strong>In the the case of a missed assignment deadline or quiz</strong>, the instructor will either</p><ul><li>waive the course component and re-weight remaining term work as he/she deems fit according to circumstances and the goals of the course, or</li><li>provide an extension.</li></ul><p><strong>In the case of bereavement</strong>, the instructor will provide similar accommodations to those for illness. Appropriate documentation to support the request will be required.</p><p>Students who are experiencing extenuating circumstances should also inform their academic advisors regarding their personal difficulties.</p><p>Elective arrangements such as travel plans are not acceptable grounds for granting accommodations to course requirements per the <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Assignments-Tests-and-Final-Exams"><u>Academic regulations related to assignments, tests, and final exams</u></a>.</p><h3><strong>Department Policies</strong></h3><h4><strong>Informal resolution of conflict</strong></h4><p>We in the Psychology Department take great pride in the high quality of our program and our instructors. Though infrequent, we know that students occasionally find themselves in situations of conflict with their instructors over course policies or grade assessments. If such a conflict arises, the Department Chair (Dr. Heather Henderson) is available for consultation and to mediate a resolution between the student and instructor: Email: <a href="mailto:hhenderson@uwaterloo.ca"><u>hhenderson@uwaterloo.ca.</u></a></p><p>If informal resolution is not possible then the issue may proceed to the grievance and appeals stage as described in the University Policies section of the syllabus.</p><h4><strong>Using official UW email</strong></h4><p>Students are responsible for all email that is sent to the official UWaterloo email address. Check email regularly for important and time sensitive messages. See <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/information-systems-technology/about/policies-standards-and-guidelines/email/statement-official-student-email-address"><u>Statement on official student email address</u></a> for further details e.g., procedures and warnings regarding forwarding email to other accounts.</p><h4><strong>Anti-Racism Statement</strong></h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement</strong></h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4><strong>Generative AI</strong></h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as critical thinking skills and the ability to apply knowledge generated in the course to new scenarios. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4><strong>Mental Health Support</strong></h4><p>All of us need a support system.

However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>.
