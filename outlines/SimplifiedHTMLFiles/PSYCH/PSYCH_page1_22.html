<div>
<p><strong>Quizzes</strong></p><p>A quiz will take place at the beginning of class on Jan. 21 &amp; 28; and Mar. 4, 11, &amp; 18. Five multiple choice items will be selected from the assigned readings for the week of the quiz. Your best 4 (out of 5) quizzes will be included in your final grade.</p><p><strong>Midterm Exam</strong></p><p>The midterm on Feb. 11 will include multiple choice items and written responses, which will be drawn from the lectures and the assigned readings from the first half of the course.</p><p><strong>Final Exam</strong></p><p>The final exam will include multiple choice items and written responses, which will be drawn from the lectures and the assigned readings from the second half of the course, with the exception of one question which will be provided in our final lecture.  In addition, a take-home point will be selected in-class from each group presentation, which may be on the final exam.</p><p><strong>Class Participation Journal</strong></p><p>PSYCH 312R places high emphasis on class attendance and participation, as learning is enhanced by active engagement, open discussion, and application of course material.  By Apr. 4th, you will submit a journal to LEARN (1 - 1½ page single-spaced).  You will indicate your goals in taking this class and which lectures you were most engaged in.  You will rate your contribution to the class discussion (out of 10):  0-4 = minimal; 5 = passable, 6 = fair, 7 = good, 8 = very good, 9 = excellent, 10 = exceptional.  Justify your rating with specific examples of your contribution to the class discussion (in the larger class, smaller group-work, and presentations by your peers).     </p><p><strong>Group Presentation</strong></p><p>On our course website, sign-up by Jan. 14<sup>th</sup> to present on a selected case study (first-come, first-choice).  You and selected peers will complete a 25-30 minute Power Point presentation on an in-depth case study, which will describe: a) clinical presentation, b) assessment, c) conditions to rule out, d) treatment and e) follow-up.  You will integrate information from lectures, course readings, and your own literature-search and you will show individuals, families, schools, workplaces, clinicians, and other resources working together in your case study.  Identify the student author for each slide. in the footer  Your final grade will be based on your background knowledge, focus of presentation, effective use of audio-visual media, oral presentation skills, and generation of class discussion.  Each student will provide a 1½ - 2 page summary (single-spaced) of the key points that you covered in your specific portion of the presentation, along with another page listing your own References.  You will also attach three copies of the Group Participation Rubric (on the LEARN website) – you will rate yourself and your peers on a number of criteria (e.g. workload, organization, and showing up for meetings).</p><p><strong>SONA Participation and Research Experience Marks - Information and Guidelines</strong></p><p>Experiential learning is considered an integral part of the undergraduate program in Psychology. Research participation is one example of this, article review is another. A number of undergraduate courses have been expanded to include opportunities for Psychology students to earn grades while gaining research experience.</p><p>Since experiential learning is highly valued in the Department of Psychology, <u>students may earn up to 2% of their final mark in this course through research experience</u> (i.e., course work will make up 98% of the final mark and research experience will make up the other 2% for a maximum grade of 100%). <strong>Be sure to review the guidelines referred to later in this document.</strong></p><p>The two options for earning research experience grades; participation in research through online remotely operated and In Lab studies, as well as article review; are described below. Students may complete any combination of these options to earn research experience grades. Credits will be permitted to be earned with half from online, and the other half (1.0) from In-lab or Remote Access studies.</p><p><strong>Option 1: Participation in Psychology Research</strong></p><p>Research participation is coordinated by the Research Experiences Group (REG). Psychology students may volunteer as research participants in remotely operated, In Lab and/or online (web-based) studies conducted by students and faculty in the Department of Psychology. Participation enables students to learn first-hand about psychology research and related concepts. Many students report that participation in research is both an educational and interesting experience. Please be assured that all Psychology studies have been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee. </p><p><i><strong>How to earn extra marks for your Psychology course(s) this term by participating in studies ...</strong></i></p><ul><li>You will earn "credits" which will be converted to "marks" (1 credit = 1%)</li><li>You can schedule your remotely operated (replacing in-lab) and ONLINE studies using the "Sona" website.</li></ul><p><i><strong>Educational focus of participation in research</strong></i></p><p>To maximize the educational benefits of participating in research, students will receive feedback information following their participation in each study detailing the following elements:</p><ul><li>Purpose or objectives of the study</li><li>Dependent and independent variables</li><li>Expected results</li><li>References for at least two related research articles</li><li>Provisions to ensure confidentiality of data</li><li>Contact information of the researcher should the student have further questions about the study</li><li>Contact information for the Director of the Office of Research Ethics should the student wish to learn more about the general ethical issues surrounding research with human participants, or specific questions or concerns about the study in which s/he participated.</li></ul><p>Participation in remotely operated (counts as the same as in-lab) studies has increment values of 0.5 participation credits (grade percentage points) for each 30-minutes of participation. Participation in ONLINE studies is worth .25 credits for each 15-minutes of participation. Researchers will record student’s participation and at the end of the term the REG Coordinator will provide the course instructor with a credit report of the total credits earned by each student. </p><p><i><strong>How to participate?</strong></i></p><p><strong>Study scheduling, participation and grade assignment is managed using the SONA online system.  All students enrolled in this course have been set up with a SONA account.  You must get started early in the term.</strong></p><p><strong>For instructions on how to log in to your SONA account and for a list of important dates and deadlines please, as soon as possible, go to:</strong></p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/welcome-research-experiences-group-and-sona/sona-information">Participating/SONA information:  How to log in to Sona and sign up for studies</a></p><p><i>*** Please do not ask the Course Instructor or REG Coordinator for information unless you have first thoroughly read the information provided on this website.***</i></p><p>More information about the REG program in general is available at: <br/><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/welcome-research-experiences-group-and-sona/sona-information">Sona Information on the REG Participants website</a> or you can check the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/welcome-research-experiences-group-and-sona/sona-frequently-asked-questions-faqs">Sona FAQ on the REG website homepage</a> for additional information. </p><p><strong>Option 2: Article Review as an alternative to participation in research</strong></p><p>Students are not required to participate in research, and not all students wish to do so. As an alternative, students may opt to gain research experience by writing short reviews (1½ to 2 pages) of research articles relevant to the course. The course instructor will specify a suitable source of articles for this course (i.e., scientific journals, newspapers, magazines, other printed media). <i>You must contact your TA to get approval for the article you have chosen before writing the review. </i>Each review article counts as one percentage point. To receive credit, you must follow specific guidelines. The article review must:</p><ul><li><strong>Be submitted before the </strong><a href="http://www.quest.uwaterloo.ca/undergraduate/dates.html">last day of lectures</a><strong>. Late submissions will NOT be accepted under ANY circumstances.</strong></li><li>Be typed</li><li>Fully identify the title, author(s), source and date of the article. A copy of the article must be attached.</li><li>Identify the psychological concepts in the article and indicate the pages in the textbook that are applicable. Critically evaluate the application or treatment of those concepts in the article. If inappropriate or incorrect, identify the error and its implications for the validity of the article. You may find, for example, misleading headings, faulty research procedures, alternative explanations that are ignored, failures to distinguish factual findings from opinions, faulty statements of cause-effect relations, errors in reasoning, etc. Provide examples whenever possible.</li><li>Clearly evaluate the application or treatment of those concepts in the article.</li><li>Keep a copy of your review in the unlikely event we misplace the original.</li></ul><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
</p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Late or Incomplete Work</h4><p>Students should make every effort to submit their assignments on time. Late work will be deducted cumulatively at 10% each day that the assignment is late, including weekends. If a student anticipates a conflict with an assignment deadline or has concerns about completing the assignment, the student should contact the instructor as soon as possible once the realization is made.</p><h4>Coursework Submission Policy</h4><p>Dropboxes will be set up on LEARN to submit various assignments.  It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided if they wish to submit an alternate assignment.</p><h4>Electronic Device Policy</h4><p>Students who choose to use electronic devices to support their learning may do so provided that others are not disturbed or prohibited from their own learning. Electronic devices should be used for the purposes of supplementing the learning experience and focus on topics being discussed in class. Phones should be kept on silent during the class.</p><h4>Attendance Policy</h4><p>10% of your final grade will be based on your attendance and class participation.  Accommodation will be made for student illness or other unforeseen events.  You may miss up to two lectures without penalty.  Verification of Illness is required if you miss the midterm or final exam.   </p><h4>Communication Policy</h4><p>Email, using the uWaterloo provided email address, is the approved method of communication for Renison. The Office 365 email that you use to login using your WatIAM login and password is secure and confidential. Take caution when forwarding your WatIAM email to an external email service as confidential information forwarded to a third-party provider could be a data security breach and violation of FIPPA (Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act) under which all students, staff, and faculty are bound by law.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as critical thinking and conducting a literature review. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system.

Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details.
