<div>
<p>Psych 888, Negotiation, Conflict Management, and Teamwork, fulfils the applied course requirement for the MASc in IO Psychology or a breadth course requirement for PhD students. Graduate students outside of IO are eligible to enroll based on available space and the instructor’s approval.</p><p>In Psych 888 we will read both academic and practitioner–oriented literature on the psychological processes underlying negotiation, conflict management, and working in teams. The course content and delivery are designed to balance the mastery of scientific knowledge with its practical application. </p><p>We will address one topic per week experientially by 1) preparing for and simulating a variety of negotiation and team exercises and 2) analyzing students’ strategies and outcomes. We approach each topic using a theoretical and applied lens, analyzing why some strategies worked and others didn’t. Readings complement the classroom experience and provide a context for students to connect theory with practice.</p>

<h2><strong>Engagement &amp; Planning Documents (30%)</strong></h2><p>You are expected to attend all classes, come prepared, and participate in all exercises and class discussion.</p><p><u>Professionalism:</u> All cases are based on real world events and should be treated professionally.</p><ul><li>Treat the exercise and your counterpart as seriously as you would in the real world.</li><li>Try to do your best.</li><li>Consider the consequences of your actions within the guidelines of the exercise and in actual professional situations.</li></ul><p><u>Participation in Class Discussion:</u> You will be evaluated on the quality (not quantity) of your contributions and insights offered during class and on discussion boards. Quality comments:</p><ul><li>offer a unique and relevant perspective.</li><li>contribute to moving the discussion and analysis forward.</li><li>build on others’ comments.</li><li>include evidence, demonstrate recognition of basic concepts and reflective thinking.</li></ul><p><u>Reading Snapshot:</u> At the start of each class, we will spend 10 minutes reviewing the journal articles you were assigned to read. Each student will share one take-away from the readings. Your take-away can be a finding that surprised you, a method you thought was clever, an analysis approach you didn’t understand, etc. Please come to class on time and ready to share your take-away before we start negotiations.</p><p>NOTE: As readings are done after class, the Reading Snapshots will start in the second week of class. </p><p><u>Planning Documents.</u> In our first session, we will discuss effective negotiation planning strategies. You will then create your own planning document as you prepare outside of class for subsequent cases. Upload your planning document to Learn by 12:01 am EST on the day of class. Have your planning document handy for reference while you negotiate.</p><p>Late Planning Documents will not be accepted, as coming to class unprepared means I have to reassign your counterparts to work with someone else that day.</p><h2><strong>Analysis &amp; Reflection (30%) Due Feb 13 by 12:01 am EST</strong></h2><p>The Analysis &amp; Reflection paper asks you to reflect back on one of your in-class negotiation experiences with a critical lens, using concepts from the course readings to unpack and explain the intra- and inter-personal processes you encountered. Your writing should demonstrate understanding and application of the reading material as well as your personal take-aways (areas for growth, other situations where this might occur, etc.) moving forward.</p><p>Papers should be 3-5 pages, double spaced with 1-inch margins and 12-point Times New Roman font. Please include your name and page number in header.</p><p>Grading will be based on:</p><ul><li>Correct understanding and application of concepts from course readings</li><li>Reasonable and meaningful connections between course concepts and your negotiation, conflict management, or teamwork experience</li><li>Clear, concise writing</li><li>Grammatically correct and typo-free writing</li><li>Proper APA formatting</li></ul><p>Sample Reflection/Analysis Paper Structure:</p><ol><li>Section 1: Setting the stage<ol><li>Explain the situation you will analyze. </li><li>What was the case? What was your role? What was the outcome?</li><li>Highlight a particular area of interest that you will analyze, and why.</li></ol></li><li>Section 2: Analysis<ol><li>Choose 3-5 aspects of your experience that you can unpack with the help of course readings or content covered in our debriefs</li><li>Think critically – analyze what went as expected and what didn’t. What psychological processes (which can include interactions with situation) explain why?</li><li>In this section be careful not to write a play-by-play of your experience. Carefully select specific examples and provide detail and context as necessary for your reader to understand your analysis. </li></ol></li><li>Section 3: Summary and analogical learning. <ol><li>Summarize the take-aways from your analysis</li><li>What are some negotiation, conflict, and/or teamwork situations where you can apply this learning in the future. The more specific you are, the more likely you will remember and apply what you have learned in the future.</li></ol></li></ol><h2>Capstone Project (40%) Last 2 weeks of class</h2><p>Students have two options for the capstone project: research proposal or training program. Each can be completed individually or in teams of up to 3.</p><p><u>Research Proposal:</u></p><p>Develop a 3-5 page research proposal that extends current research in the field. Model your proposal on a grant application that succinctly makes the case for your research question, reviews literature demonstrating what we know and what we don’t know, develops theoretically grounded predictions, proposes methods (sample, procedures, measures) for studying the research question, and closes with theoretical and practical contributions.</p><p>Papers should be 3-5 pages (excluding references), double spaced with 1-inch margins and 12-point Times New Roman font, in APA format. Please include your name and page number in header. </p><p>Grading will be done by me and will be based on:</p><ul><li>originality, significance and expected contribution to knowledge</li><li>appropriateness of the literature review</li><li>appropriateness of the theoretical approach or framework</li><li>appropriateness of the methods/approach</li><li>clear, concise writing</li><li>grammatically correct and typo-free writing</li><li>proper APA formatting</li></ul><p><u>Leader Training Program: </u></p><p>Each week in class I will lead you through an experiential learning exercise and debrief designed for MBA, Executive, and LDP learners to acquire new knowledge and skills. Some exercises may incorporate an individual assessment. This active learning approach involves more than just receiving information. It involves questioning, discussing, and doing, all of which are key processes for adult learners. Thus, action learning engages students as partners, teammates, and teachers (Levin, 1996; Clark, 2014). </p><p>For the capstone exercise, students will work in small teams to develop a 90-minute training program that you will deliver in-class on March 27 and April 3. The topic and content of your session must be approved by the instructor. </p><p>Grading will be done by all of your learners and will be based on the degree to which:</p><ul><li>The training program covered promised objectives</li><li>Trainers encouraged participation and questions</li><li>Participants gained knowledge, skills, and/or abilities</li><li>Participants feel prepared to use what they learned</li><li>Participants have identified specific future application of what they have learned</li><li>Trainers and training material were professional and engaging</li></ul><p> </p>

<p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, <i>[insert relevant course-specific Learning Outcomes]</i>.  Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>
