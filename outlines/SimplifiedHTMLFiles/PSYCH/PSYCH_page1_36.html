<p><i><strong>Course Description</strong></i></p><p>The single-case approach in neuropsychology has made a significant contribution to our understanding of the architecture of human cognition. Much of what we know about human behaviour has come from more than a century of observations of people with head injuries, brain diseases, or unusual pathologies. Studying such patients can provide insights into the brain basis of cognitive processes such as attention, perception, personality, emotion, memory, decision making, and language capacity. </p><p>This seminar will first review the basic methodological approach used in single case studies, and the limitations of those approaches, before moving on to a more detailed examination of particular classic cases and their relevance to what we know today. The goal of the course is to examine classic neuropsychological patient cases in order to understand how these have informed current models of human behaviour. </p>

<p><i><u>Case Study Presentation (30%) </u></i></p><p>Students will be responsible for finding a relevant modern case study (studies with two or three patients are fine – but the point is to find something that is NOT a large group study). With respect to content, the modern case should come from the same domain as the classic – for example, if the classic for that week was HM, then the modern case should deal with memory.</p><p><strong>25-minute presentation + 5-minute question period</strong></p><p>The presentation should cover the following points:</p><ol><li>Description of the study and its main findings</li><li>Advances to our models of behaviour relevant to the classic case</li><li>Some discussion of the limitations of the work</li></ol><p><i><strong>Note: </strong></i></p><p><i>Students should<strong> choose their case study early </strong>and send it to the instructors to <strong>post on LEARN no later than <u>1 week prior</u> to their presentation.</strong></i></p><p><i>When<strong> multiple students present in a given week </strong>then presenting students for that week should <strong><u>co-ordinate</u> both their presentations and plans for group discussion <u>to avoid overlap</u>.</strong></i></p><p><i><u>Group Discussion Leader (15%) </u></i></p><p>The student presenting that week will then <strong>lead a 30-minute group discussion</strong> that should do the following:</p><ol><li>Make use of the Discussion Prompts (see below) relative to that week’s paper.</li><li>Engage critical thinking regarding the cognitive domain of interest.</li></ol><p>Resources for leading class discussions (make use of these to shape how you lead your class).</p><ol><li>Center for Teaching Excellence:  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/teaching-resources/teaching-tips/alternatives-lecturing/discussions/facilitating-effective-discussions"><u>link</u></a></li><li>Cult of Pedagogy: <a href="https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/speaking-listening-techniques/"><u>link</u></a></li><li>Edutopia: <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/blog/make-class-discussions-more-exciting-richard-curwin"><u>link</u></a></li></ol><p><i><u>Class Participation (15%)</u></i></p><p>One of the key values of undergraduate seminars comes from the interactions among students where key ideas are discussed and challenged.

Read these, then prepare a <i><strong><u>1,500 word max paper</u></strong></i><strong> </strong>outlining “What can we learn from a broken brain?” </p><p>The nature of this assignment is such that it aims to help you build a case/argument and to have periodic feedback on your writing. While it is worth a substantial part of the final grade, it is split into stages.  </p><p><strong><u>Part 1</u>:</strong> Outline your plan for your assignment in point form (no more than a sentence per point).

Psychology students may volunteer as research participants in lab and/or online studies conducted by students and faculty in the Department of Psychology. All Psychological studies have undergone prior ethics review and clearance through a Univeristy of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee. Participation is optional. </p><p><strong>Sona Participation and Research Experience Marks</strong><br/><strong>Information and Guidelines</strong></p><p>Experiential learning is considered an integral part of the undergraduate program in Psychology. Research participation is one example of this, article review is another. A number of undergraduate courses have been expanded to include opportunities for Psychology students to earn grades while gaining research experience.</p><p>Since experiential learning is highly valued in the Department of Psychology, students may earn a <strong>"Bonus" grade of up to 2%</strong> in this course through research experience. Course work will make up 100% of the final mark and your SONA mark, with a bonus of up to a 2% added to your final grade</p><p>The two options for earning research experience grades; participation in research through online remotely operated and In Lab studies, as well as article review; are described below. Students may complete any combination of these options to earn research experience grades. Credits will be permitted to be earned with half from online, and the other half (1.0) from In-lab or Remote Access studies.</p><p><strong>Option 1: Participation in Psychology Research</strong></p><p>Research participation is coordinated by the Research Experiences Group (REG). Psychology students may volunteer as research participants in remotely operated, In Lab and/or online (web-based) studies conducted by students and faculty in the Department of Psychology. Participation enables students to learn first-hand about psychology research and related concepts. Many students report that participation in research is both an educational and interesting experience. Please be assured that all Psychology studies have been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Board. </p><p><i><strong>How to earn extra marks for your Psychology course(s) this term by participating in studies ...</strong></i></p><ul><li>You will earn "credits" which will be converted to "marks" (1 credit = 1%)</li><li>You can schedule your studies using the "Sona" website.</li></ul><p><i><strong>Educational focus of participation in research</strong></i></p><p>To maximize the educational benefits of participating in research, students will receive feedback information following their participation in each study detailing the following elements:</p><ul><li>Purpose or objectives of the study</li><li>Dependent and independent variables</li><li>Expected results</li><li>References for at least two related research articles</li><li>Provisions to ensure confidentiality of data</li><li>Contact information of the researcher should the student have further questions about the study</li><li>Contact information for the Director of the Office of Research Ethics should the student wish to learn more about the general ethical issues surrounding research with human participants, or specific questions or concerns about the study in which s/he participated.</li></ul><p>Participation in remotely operated (counts as the same as in-lab) studies has increment values of 0.5 participation credits (grade percentage points) for each 30-minutes of participation. Participation in ONLINE studies is worth .25 credits for each 15-minutes of participation.  Researchers will record student’s participation and at the end of the term the REG Coordinator will provide the course instructor with a credit report of the total credits earned by each student. </p><p><i><strong>How to participate?</strong></i></p><p><strong>Study scheduling, participation and grade assignment is managed using the SONA online system.  All students enrolled in this course have been set up with a SONA account.  You must get started early in the term.</strong></p><p><strong>For instructions on how to log in to your SONA account and for a list of important dates and deadlines please, as soon as possible, go to:</strong></p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/welcome-research-experiences-group-and-sona/sona-information">Participating/SONA information:  How to log in to Sona and sign up for studies</a></p><p><i>*** Please do not ask the Course Instructor or REG Coordinator for information unless you have first thoroughly read the information provided on this website.***</i></p><p>More information about the REG program in general is available at: <br/><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/welcome-research-experiences-group-and-sona/sona-information">Sona Information on the REG Participants website</a> or you can check the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research-experiences-group/welcome-research-experiences-group-and-sona/sona-frequently-asked-questions-faqs">Sona FAQ on the REG website homepage</a> for additional information. </p><p><strong>Option 2: Article Review as an alternative to participation in research</strong></p><p>Students are not required to participate in research, and not all students wish to do so. As an alternative, students may opt to gain research experience by writing short reviews (1½ to 2 pages) of research articles relevant to the course. The course instructor will specify a suitable source of articles for this course (i.e., scientific journals, newspapers, magazines, other printed media). <i>You must contact your TA to get approval for the article you have chosen before writing the review. </i>Each review article counts as one percentage point. To receive credit, you must follow specific guidelines. The article review must:</p><ul><li><strong>Be submitted before the </strong><a href="http://www.quest.uwaterloo.ca/undergraduate/dates.html">last day of lectures</a><strong>. Late submissions will NOT be accepted under ANY circumstances.</strong></li><li>Be typed</li><li>Fully identify the title, author(s), source and date of the article. A copy of the article must be attached.</li><li>Identify the psychological concepts in the article and indicate the pages in the textbook that are applicable. Critically evaluate the application or treatment of those concepts in the article. If inappropriate or incorrect, identify the error and its implications for the validity of the article. You may find, for example, misleading headings, faulty research procedures, alternative explanations that are ignored, failures to distinguish factual findings from opinions, faulty statements of cause-effect relations, errors in reasoning, etc. Provide examples whenever possible.</li><li>Clearly evaluate the application or treatment of those concepts in the article.</li><li>Keep a copy of your review in the unlikely event we misplace the original.</li></ul><p> </p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as critical thinking, building an argument and synthesis of ideas. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.

Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors.

A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.

<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
