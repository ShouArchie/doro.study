<p><strong>Theory Work A (TWA) - </strong>These are assignments for chapters 7, 8, 11 &amp; 12. You will submit these assignments to KRITIK in PDF and mp3 formats. Kritik is an online peer evaluations tool for which you will be required to register. A rubric for grading and evaluating is provided in KRITIK. Then you will be required to evaluate three or four of your peers work using a rubric and written evaluation. Finally you will give feedback on the evaluations given to you. This will require you to better learn the rules of Western Art Music theory counterpoint and harmony and will inform your own work as you move through the course. These are due on Mondays at 11:59pm, with the peer evaluations due Friday at 11:59pm and peer assessment due the following Monday. There is a PRACTICE assignment (TWA-01) for the first week, and will count in the TWB area – you will get FULL marks for completing this first assignment regardless how you actually did on the assignment. There are four assignments and each is worth 6% of your grade (NO assignment in this category is dropped) 4 x 6% = 24% of final grade.</p><p><strong>Theory Work B (TWB) – </strong>These are complete end-of-chapter assignments for chapters 5, 6, 9, 10 &amp; 13 and cadence and final assignments for chapter 12. You can submit these assignment to Dr Sunabacka in-person by 4pm on the day they are due (or to her box in the Music Office or Main Grebel Reception), although you can also submit these assignments to the appropriate LEARN dropbox in PDF and mp3 formats. These are due on Mondays at 11:59pm. <strong>The lowest grades in this category will be dropped. </strong>There are 8 assignments in this category, 1 is dropped and each assignment is worth 4%. So 7 x 4% =  28% of final grade</p><p><strong>Textbook ONLINE Quizzes (TBOQ) </strong>are due on Wednesdays before the in-person class (1pm). I will not be lecturing the textbook material in detail as we have limited in-class time. I expect you to have read the chapter (or section) AND completed the online test BEFORE the second class of the weeks topic. During the Wednesday class we will be applying the material you learned in the reading to small in-class assignments (generally analysis exercises.) <strong>The lowest TWO grades in this category will be dropped. </strong>There are 12 weekly assignments with 1 per week. The 2 with the lowest grade will be dropped, 10 x 0.8 % = 8% of final grade</p><p><strong>Online Practice Exercises (OP) </strong>are due every Friday at 11:59pm. These assignments are on Artusi Music, an online program on which you are required to register. There is one set of practice exercises per week (called <i>Worksheets</i> on Artusi) and will include practice for TWA and TWB assignments along with practice for the weekly Quiz dictations. These assignments help you develop the skills you need to learn the language of music. Regular practice is vital for fluidity in reading and performing music. For each online assignment you will receive immediate feedback so you can keep working on the areas that need improvement and more practice. These assignments are not graded in detail, rather you will receive <strong>full credit for getting to 70% in this online program</strong>. My hope is that you will try all the different exercises and then work through the areas in which you need to practice. Everyone is different and may need to practice different things. <strong>The lowest TWO grades in this category will be dropped. </strong>There are 12 weekly assignments with 1 per week, lowest 2 grades will be dropped, so 10 x 0.9% each = 9% of final grade. </p><p><strong>Quiz Dictations (QD) </strong>are an important aspect of developing your musical skills. There are 5 Quiz-Dictations during the term (worth 1% each, 1 will drop for a total of 4%). These quizzes can be taken during the Friday performance classes (the classes where we focus on sight-singing and ear training with a bit of keyboard skills! There will always be practice quizzes in the weeks before a Quiz-Dictation that will be graded. There will also be a <strong>Midterm Quiz-Dictation</strong> and a <strong>Final </strong>Quiz-Dictation, each worth 2% based on material from previous quiz-dictations. The Midterm Quiz-dictation will be given during class time (on Friday Feb. 28th), and the Final Quiz-dictation will be part of the Final written exam.  </p><p><strong>Performance Assignments (PA) </strong>are an important practical part of your learning in this course and are worth 8%. You will be required to perform in class with a group (on Fridays). These assignments are short and we will be doing lots of practice during the Friday classes, especially during weeks when there is no Performance Assignment being graded, or a Quiz-Dictation. For the formal weekly performances you will receive a total of 4%. There are 5 weeks during the term where a regular performance assignment is due. These will help you prepare for the midterm and final. One will be dropped.</p><p>There will also be a <strong>Midterm Performance Assignment</strong> (worth 2%) and <strong>Final Performance Assignment</strong> (worth 2%) that must be in-person during class or in an individual meeting with professor. Most of the materials you prepare for the midterm and final performance assignments will have been practiced weekly during class and is essentially the culmination of the work during the first half (midterm) and then the second half (final) of the course. There will be an added keyboard component to these assignments. More information will be given in class.</p><p>The <strong>Final Exam </strong>will happen in-person and during the exam period. More details will be given in-class and in the final module on LEARN.</p><p><strong>LATE ASSIGNMENTS </strong>will not be accepted, as it is important to keep up with the work. However, I will give each student ONE WEEK over the course of the term in which a late assignment will be accepted. Please email Dr Sunabacka when you need an assignment extended. But also note that in most categories at least one assignment will be dropped. Use your late days wisely.</p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
