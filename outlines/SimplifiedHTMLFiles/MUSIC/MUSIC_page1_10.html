<p>The following is a brief description of each type of assignment you will be completing for the course:</p><p><strong>Theory Assignments </strong>“A” and/or “B” are due every Monday at 4:30pm and it is preferred that this is handed directly to Dr Sunabacka, or submitted to her box in the Music Office, or the main office (Reception). As a last resort, it may be submitted via the LEARN site dropbox. Together, these assignments are worth 56% of your grade. These assignments can be handwritten or completed in MuseScore. If you submit via the dropbox, you must export the assignment as both a PDF and mp3 file. The “A” assignments are original compositions and are worth more that the “B” assignments. The “B” assignments are either analysis or the proposal for your Final Project. These assignments are all vital to your understanding of the course material and none will be dropped.</p><p><strong>Online Artusi Assignments (Worksheets) </strong>are worth 16% of your grade, are due every Friday at 11:59pm until March 14th. These are all ARTUSI problem sets and give you more practice with the new chords you are learning. Each assignment is related directly to the course materials highlighted in the week and will help you with the T3A or T3B written assignments due the following Monday. For these assignments you will receive immediate feedback so you can keep working on the areas that need improvement and more practice. The assignment with the lowest grade will be dropped.</p><p><strong>Practice Quizzes and Quizzes </strong>are Artusi online exercises that incorporate musicianship skills. You will be completing rhythmic, melodic and harmonic dictations, as well as seventh chord recognition. You will practice one week, with immediate feedback, and then complete a quiz, based on the same exercises, the following week. There are only 4 of each type of assignment (for a total 8 Quiz-Dictation assignments) Once we get to Ch 29 or into the Formal Analysis section of the course, there are no more quiz assignments so that you are able to focus on your final project.</p><p>The <strong>Final Project </strong>is an project that you choose. You can either write a Romance, or complete an analysis of your choice. This should bring together all that you have learned in Theory, starting from Music 270 and show how to apply this to either composition or analysis. You will need to spend a good amount of time on this assignment and Dr. Sunabacka will be helping you with this during class. More details and a handout with options, will be given during week 9 of the class.</p><p><strong>LATE ASSIGNMENTS </strong>will not be accepted, as it is important to keep up with the work. However, I will give each student ONE WEEK over the course of the term in which a late assignment will be accepted. Please email Dr Sunabacka when you need an assignment extended. Use this wisely.</p>

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.

Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo, 1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6</p><h4>Anti-Racism Statement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate.
