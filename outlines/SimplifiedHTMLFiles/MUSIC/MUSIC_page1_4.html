<h2>Prerequisite: </h2><p>No prerequisite, although this course is NOT intended for students with more than a minimal music background. Music 111 cannot be counted toward fulfillment of music major or minor course requirements. </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is your responsibility as university students to seek out challenging ideas and materials, to stimulate your curiosity, and to delve into new areas. If you have RCM Level 8 theory or higher, or equivalent studies or experience, you should not be taking this course. </p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>This course follows a regular weekly schedule, so you always know when assignments are due. A general week will be as follows:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Mondays 12:00am</td><td>LEARN module for that week is released with week-specific schedule and assignments. There is a step-by-step list of the recommended order that you work through the materials, and links to where your work is to be completed or submitted. </td></tr><tr><td>Mondays 1:30-2:50pm</td><td>In-person lecture class (in CGC Room 1302)</td></tr><tr><td>Tuesdays 11:59pm</td><td><p>Written Assignment based on materials from PREVIOUS week DUE</p><p>(These are always due following our Monday class, in case there are last-minute questions.)</p></td></tr><tr><td>Wednesdays 1:30-2:50pm</td><td>In-person lecture class</td></tr><tr><td>Fridays 11:59pm</td><td><p>TWO smaller assignments are DUE:</p><ul><li>Quiz-Dictation (Practice or Graded)</li><li>Online Practice Exercises</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Sundays 11:59pm</td><td>Performance Video Assignments (on BONGO) DUE</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Assignments are named according to the week in which they are assigned. For example, looking at Week 2 the following assignments are assigned:</p><ul><li>Quiz-Dictation 2 (Practice): LEARN Quiz (Due Friday)</li><li>Online Practice-02a (Artusi: Worksheet 2, a) (Due Friday)</li><li>Online Practice-02b (Artusi: Worksheet 2, b) (Due Friday)</li><li>Video Assignment-02 (Practice) on BONGO (Due Sunday)</li><li>Written Assignment-02 (Due the following Tuesday)</li></ul><p>NOTE: they all have “2” in the title since they are assigned in Week 2 and attached to the covered material of Week 2.</p><p>The following is a brief description of each type of assignment you will be completing for the course:</p><p><strong>Written Assignments</strong> are due every TUESDAY at 11:59pm and often consist of two parts. One part is a Quiz on Artusi, and the other is an analysis from the textbook that is completed via a LEARN Quiz. There are occasions when one part will be a written assignment that is to be handed in via the LEARN site dropbox in PDF format or into the Written Assignment Quiz. These are the most important assignments in this course and are worth 40% (4% per assignment). There are 11 assignments, but <strong>one assignment with the lowest grade will be dropped</strong>. </p><p><strong>Online Practice Exercises </strong>are worth 13% of your grade, are due every FRIDAY at 11:59pm and are to be completed online. Most of these assignments are on Artusi Music, an online program for which you are required to register. The Quiz tool on LEARN will also be used for some of these practice exercises. There are generally two practice exercises per week (called <i>Worksheets</i> on Artusi), which are related directly to the following written assignment and quiz-dictation. These assignments help you develop the skills you need to learn the language of music. Regular practice is vital for fluidity in reading and performing music. For each online assignment you will receive immediate feedback so you can keep working on the areas that need improvement and more practice. These assignments are not graded in detail, rather you will receive full credit for getting to 50% in this online program. My hope is that you will try all the different parts of the exercise and then work through the areas in which you need to practice. Everyone is different and may need to practice different things. </p><p><strong>Online Quiz-Dictations </strong>are an important aspect of developing your musical skills and are worth 10%. These will be released weekly through LEARN and are due each FRIDAY at 11:59pm. Only half of these quizzes will be fully graded and you will always have an opportunity to practice first in one week before your quiz will be graded fully the following week. <strong>Two Practice Quizzes will be dropped and One Fully Graded Quiz with the lowest grade will be dropped.</strong> These weekly quizzes will also help you prepare for the dictation section of the midterm and final assessments.</p><p><strong>Performance Video Assignments </strong>are an important practical part of your learning in this course and are worth 12%. You will be required to submit through BONGO, one video a week, due each SUNDAY at 11:59pm. These will be short videos asking you to complete a few tasks that demonstrate the ways you are engaging and performing the newly learned course materials. You will also be required to complete peer reviews (three per week). For these weekly videos you will receive a total of 4%. There will also be a midterm (4%) and final (4%) video that you will submit only to the professor. The materials you prepare for the midterm and final videos will have been practiced in the weekly shared videos and is essentially the culmination of the work during the first half (midterm) and then the second half (final) of the course. </p><p>The <strong>Midterm Assessment </strong>will be given online and will include questions based on the practice exercises and written assignments as well as a dictation based on the Quiz-Dictations. </p><p>The <strong>Final Assessment</strong> will be given online and will include questions based on the practice exercises and written assignments as well as a dictation based on the Quiz-Dictations. </p><p><strong>LATE ASSIGNMENTS </strong>will not be accepted, as it is important to keep up with the work. However, each student will be given ONE WEEK over the course of the term in which a late assignment will be accepted. Please email Prof. Wagler when you need an assignment extended. But note that in each category at least one assignment can be dropped. Use this wisely.</p><h2>Course Schedule:</h2><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Week &amp; Dates</strong></td><td><strong>TOPICS AND CHAPTERS</strong></td><td><strong>ASSIGNMENTS </strong><br/>(All assignments are due at 11:59pm on date given)</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Week 1:</strong></p><p>January 6-10</p></td><td><p>Introduction to Course &amp; Online Resources</p><p><strong>Chapter 1 – Notating Rhythm</strong></p><ul><li>Note &amp; Rest Values</li><li>Measures</li><li>Time Signatures</li><li>Larger and smaller note values</li><li>Dots and ties</li><li>Flags and beams</li></ul><p> </p></td><td><p><strong>DUE Fri.
