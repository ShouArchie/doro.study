Attendance will be checked in the beginning and/or at the end of the class. You must contact the instructor by e-mail as soon as possible if an emergency precludes you from attending the class. Absences and lateness will incur deduction of marks. Doctor’s note from the campus clinic is needed for any absence due to medical emergency.  </p><p> </p><p>Assessment 2</p><p>TED Talk Review:  TED is a non-profit organization whose mission is to share“Ideas Worth Spreading”as a global community in the form of talks. You should write a review on the  TED Talk that you select out of the 24 talks listed (See TED Talk Review Requirements and Rubrics on LEARN). You need submit the TED Talk review in the drop box set up on LEARN . (Due before 11:59pm on Feb 3, Monday, 2025.)</p><p> </p><p>Assessment 3</p><p>Oral Presentation:  </p><p>1. Presentation groups are formed automatically by Bongo system embedded on LEARN , with 3-4 students for each group.</p><p>2. You should be meeting your group members regularly in person or through Bongo to discuss about and decide on the topic for your group presentation, as well as the sections that each of you are in charge of. You may choose any topic on Chinese culture and society to make a 20-minute group presentation (with around 5 minutes for each in the group). You are responsible for reporting to your teammates regularly on the progress of your section and editing the different sections into a coherent and logical piece before the final submission.  </p><p>3.  It is your duty to contact your group members once the system automatically assigns you into one of the groups, and to participate actively throughout the group work. It is required that you appear IN PERSON in the video, along with the shared PowerPoint screen of the presentation (Bongo possesses features and functionalities that allow you to make videos online with shared screens). Bongo allows you to prepare for and proceed online until the group video assignment is completed.</p><p>4. Upon completion of the oral presentation, you should submit the group video on Bongo. There is only ONE video submission allowed for each group. Meanwhile, you should download the "Group Work Checklist Form" attached on LEARN and fill it out. The scanned form with your signature should be submitted in the drop box on LEARN. You need submit the signed form INDIVIDUALLY. Both the group video and the signed group work checklist form should be submitted before 11:59pm on Mar 14, Friday, 2025. You should also complete peer reviews on 3 group videos that Bongo automatically assigns before 11:59pm on Mar 21, Friday, 2025.</p><p>5.  You will be assessed and graded individually according to the criteria listed in the Oral Presentation Rubrics posted on LEARN. However, the organization/structure part of the whole presentation will be assessed based on the group performance.  </p><p> </p><p>Assessment 4</p><p>Final Essay (Book Review): After reading the selected book from the reading list (posted in the course website on LEARN), you should complete a book review following the requirements and rubrics as the term paper, which should be between 4-5 pages (Double-spaced; Font size 12). You should finish reading at least half of the selected book and write an outline of the book review at the beginning of March. The outline of book review (10%) is due on Mar 3 (Monday), 2025. And the review of the whole book (i. e. the final essay, 20%)  is due on April 1(Tuesday), 2025. The final essay may deviate from the standard APA format in that you may write in the first person pronoun. All citations, however, must be made using APA format (requiring in-text citations, and a works cited page). You should follow Purdue OWL: APA Formatting and Style Guide. Your submission should include a cover page with the student’s name, student ID number, date of submission and title, along with numbered pages of the essay. You should submit both the outline and the book review (as the final essay) in the drop boxes set up on LEARN.</p><p> </p><p>Assessment 5</p><p>Final Exam: At the end of the term there will be an open-book examination, which will cover all the topics we have discussed during the whole term.

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.<br/><br/>• Turnitin.com has now embedded the AI Detection Tool to identify any academic mis-conduct of submitting AI-generated essays. You should complete your final essay INDEPENDENTLY and it is STRICTLY forbidden to resort to any help from artificial intelligence tools in writing the mid-term or final essays.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Late Work </strong></p><p>Students should make every effort to submit their assignments on time. Late work will be deducted cumulatively at 5% each day that the assignment is late, including weekends. If a student anticipates a conflict with an assignment deadline or has concerns about completing the assignment, they should contact the instructor as soon as possible. All homework must be submitted to the LEARN dropboxes as instructed.</p><p><strong>Electronic Device Policy </strong></p><p>Electronic devices are allowed in class, provided they do not disturb teaching or learning, and  are used for appropriate, educational purposes that directly support or enhance learning. <br/>1. Cell phones or similar communication devices should be turned off or put into silent<br/>     mode during the class.<br/>2. The use of personal electronic devices in the classroom must be restricted to activities that  <br/>    further the educational mission of the class in session (e.g., taking notes, etc.).<br/>3. Use of electronic resources for other purposes (e.g., playing games, reading and sending   <br/>    emails, etc.) is forbidden.</p><p><strong>Communication Policy</strong></p><p>Email, using the uWaterloo provided email address, is the approved method of communication for Renison. The Office 365 email that you use to login using your WatIAM login and password is secure and confidential. Take caution when forwarding your WatIAM email to an external email service as confidential information forwarded to a third-party provider could be a data security breach and violation of FIPPA (Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act) under which all students, staff, and faculty are bound by law.</p><h2>Information on Plagiarism Detection </h2><p>Students and faculty at the University of Waterloo share an important responsibility to maintain the integrity of the teaching and learning relationship. This relationship is characterized by honesty, fairness, and mutual respect for the aim and principles of the pursuit of education. Academic misconduct impedes the activities of the university community and is punishable by appropriate disciplinary action. I, as instructor of EASIA202R, reserve the right to use electronic means to detect and help prevent plagiarism. Students agree that by taking this course all assignments are subject to submission for textual similarity review by software (e.g., Turnitin.com or Grammarly). Assignments submitted to Turnitin.com will be included as source documents in Turnitin.com's restricted access database solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism in such documents for five academic years. The instructor may require students to submit their assignments electronically to Turnitin.com or the instructor may submit questionable text on behalf of a student.<br/><br/>“Policy 71’s glossary defines plagiarism, in part, as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others (whether attributed or anonymous) as one’s own in any work submitted whether or not for grading purposes”…<br/><br/>The Vice-President Academic and Dean has the authority to assess instances of plagiarism and the resultant penalties that are raised by an instructor. An instructor can propose a grade penalty to the Vice-President Academic and Dean, who will decide whether to accept the penalty or initiate a formal inquiry.”<br/><br/>For additional information on how plagiarism is dealt with at Renison, review the policy from where the above text is copied: Policy 71 - Student Discipline.<br/><br/>Students should also be aware that copyright laws in Canada prohibit reproducing more than 10% of any work without permission from its author, publisher, or other copyright holder. See Waterloo’s policy on Fair Dealing.  Violation of Canada’s Copyright Act is a punishable academic offence under Policy 71 – Student Discipline.</p><p><strong>Turnitin.com</strong>: Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p><p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p><h2>Writing and Communication Centre</h2><p>The Writing and Communication Centre (WCC) works with students as they develop their ideas, draft, and revise. Writing and Communication specialists offer one-on-one support in planning assignments, synthesizing and citing research, organizing papers and reports, designing presentations and e-portfolios, and revising for clarity and coherence. </p><p>You can make multiple appointments throughout the term, or you can drop in at the Library for quick questions or feedback. To book a 50-minute appointment and to see drop-in hours, visit <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/wcc">www.uwaterloo.ca/wcc</a>. Group appointments for team-based projects, presentations, and papers are also available.</p><p><strong>Please note</strong> that communication specialists guide you to see your work as readers would. They can teach you revising skills and strategies, but will not change or correct your work for you. </p><p><strong>Final Examination Policy</strong></p><p>Students should be aware that student travel plans are not acceptable grounds for granting an alternative final examination time (see:<a href="file:///D:/EASIA%20Courses/EASIA202R/EASIA202R%202024/EASIA202R%20Spring%202024/Final%20Examination%20Schedule%20https:/uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations">Final Examination Schedule https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations</a> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Accommodation for Illness or Unforeseen Circumstances:</strong></p><p>The instructor follows the practices of the University of Waterloo in accommodating students who have documented reasons for missing quizzes or exams.

When misconduct has been found to have occurred, disciplinary penalties are imposed under the University of Waterloo Policy 71 – Student Discipline. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 - Student Discipline</a> (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71</a>).
