<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided if they wish to submit an alternate assignment.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Renison University College Land Acknowledgement</h3><p>With gratitude, we acknowledge that Renison University College is located on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg, Hodinohsyó:ni, and Attawandaran (Neutral) Peoples, which is situated on the Haldimand Tract, land granted to the Six Nations that includes ten kilometres on each side of the Grand River from mouth to source. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place in all corners of our campus through research, learning, teaching, community building, and outreach. We are guided by the work of our Anti-Racism and Decolonization Spokescouncil, and the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">University of Waterloo Office of Indigenous Relations</a>. </p><h3>Course Policies</h3><h4>Late Work</h4><p>Students should make every effort to submit their assignments on time. If a student anticipates a conflict with an assignment deadline or has concerns about completing the assignment, the student should contact the instructor as soon as possible once the realization is made.</p><p>At the discretion of the instructor, movie review assignments submitted after the deadline may be penalized with the loss of a grade of 2% for each day late up to a maximum of 3 weeks.</p><h3>Department Policies</h3><h4>Policy on Plagiarism </h4><p>“Policy 71’s glossary defines plagiarism, in part, as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others (whether attributed or anonymous) as one’s own in any work submitted whether or not for grading purposes”…</p><p>The Vice-President Academic and Dean has the authority to assess instances of plagiarism and the resultant penalties that are raised by an instructor. An instructor can propose a grade penalty to the Vice-President Academic and Dean, who will decide whether to accept the penalty or initiate a formal inquiry.”</p><p>For additional information on how plagiarism is dealt with at Renison, review the policy from where the above text is copied: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 - Student Discipline</a>.</p><p>Students should also be aware that copyright laws in Canada prohibit reproducing more than 10% of any work without permission from its author, publisher, or other copyright holder. See Waterloo’s policy on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/fair-dealing-advisory">Fair Dealing</a>.  Violation of Canada’s Copyright Act is a punishable academic offence under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 – Student Discipline</a>.</p><h4>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of skills in writing as well as in comprehensive observation and analysis of various issues in society. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Communication Policy</h4><p>Email, using the uWaterloo provided email address, is the approved method of communication with UWaterloo faculty, staff, and students. The Office 365 email that you use to login using your WatIAM login and password is secure and confidential.</p><h4>Final Examination Policy</h4><p>For <strong>Fall 2024</strong>, the established examination period is <strong>December 6 – December 19.</strong> The schedule will be available early June. Students should be aware that student travel plans are not acceptable grounds for granting an alternative final examination time. See the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/exam-schedule">Final Examination Schedule</a>.</p><h4>Accommodation for Illness or Unforeseen Circumstances</h4><p>The instructor follows the practices of the University of Waterloo in accommodating students who have documented reasons for missing quizzes or exams. See <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/accommodation-due-to-illness">Accommodation due to illness</a>. </p><p><strong>Accommodation Due to Religious Observances</strong></p><p>The University acknowledges that, due to the pluralistic nature of the University community, some students may seek accommodations on religious grounds. Accordingly, students must consult with their instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought. Failure to provide a timely request will decrease the likelihood of providing an accommodation. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/important-dates/2023-2024/requests-accommodations-religious-grounds-due">See Request for accommodation on religious grounds.</a></p><h4>Academic Integrity, Grievance, Discipline, Appeals and Note for Students with Disabilities</h4><p><i><strong>Academic Integrity: </strong></i>To maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. See the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">UWaterloo Academic Integrity </a> and the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/academic-standing-understanding-your-unofficial-transcript/ethical-behaviour">Arts Academic Integrity </a> websites for more information. </p><p>Renison University College is committed to the view that when a problem or disagreement arises between a faculty member and a student every effort should be made to resolve the problem through mutual and respectful negotiation. Most issues are resolved by a student/faculty meeting to discuss differences of opinion. It is only after this stage, when a common understanding or agreement is not obtained that further actions listed below could be taken.</p><p><i><strong>Discipline:</strong></i> Every student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offences, and to take responsibility for their own actions. [Check the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">Office of Academic Integrity</a> website for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration, should seek guidance from the course professor or academic advisor. When misconduct has been found to have occurred, disciplinary penalties are imposed under the University of Waterloo <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 – Student Discipline</a>. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 - Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties check the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p><p><i><strong>Grievance:</strong></i>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the Department’s administrative assistant, or Academic Advisor, who will provide further assistance.</p><p><i><strong>Appeals:</strong></i>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p><p><i><strong>Academic Integrity Office (UWaterloo): </strong></i>The website can be found at <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/</a></p><h4>Accommodation for Students with Disabilities</h4><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a> is located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, and collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p><p>Students are encouraged to register with AccessAbility Services (AAS) at the start of each term if they require accommodations due to a disability. However, some students not connected to AAS may require accommodations later in the term. In that case, you should immediately consult with your instructor and/or your Academic Advisor.</p><h4>Intellectual Property</h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of the instructor, which can include:</p><ul><li>lecture handouts and presentations (e.g., PowerPoint slides)</li><li>lecture content, both spoken and written (and any audio or video recording thereof)</li><li>questions from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams)</li><li>work protected by copyright (i.e., any work authored by the instructor)  </li></ul><p>Making available the intellectual property of instructors without their express written consent (e.g., uploading lecture notes or assignments to an online repository) is considered theft of intellectual property and subject to disciplinary sanctions as described in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 – Student Discipline</a>. Students who become aware of the availability of what may be their instructor’s intellectual property in online repositories are encouraged to alert the instructor.</p><h4>Mental Health Support</h4><p>All of us need a support system. The faculty and staff in Arts encourage students to seek out mental health supports if they are needed. </p><p><strong>On Campus</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services">Counselling Services:</a> counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca / 519-888-4096</li><li><a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/mates/">MATES</a>:  one-to-one peer support program offered by the Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) and Counselling Services</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services">Health Services</a> – Student Medical Clinic: located across the creek from Student Life Centre</li></ul><p><strong>Off Campus, 24/7</strong></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.good2talk.ca/">Good2Talk</a>:  Free confidential help line for post-secondary students.
