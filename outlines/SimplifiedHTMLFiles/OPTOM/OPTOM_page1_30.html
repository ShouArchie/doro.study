<p><strong>MANDATORY COMPONENTS OF THIS COURSE </strong>are weekly labs, weekly lab quizzes (these will be open for 4.5 days after 530pm), in-lab reflection, the final lab exam, and the final course assessment (Faculty of Science-approved calculators permitted). Please follow the School's absence policy (described in the Administrative Policy section) for any planned or unplanned absences from mandatory components. </p><p><i><strong>Consequences of a missed mandatory element:</strong></i></p><ul><li>Where a student requests a planned absence, or notifies of an unplanned absence from a mandatory course assessment, attempts will be made to accommodate the absence. In the event that the request cannot be accommodated, the missed graded element will be added to the weight of the final examination. If the missed mandatory is a final assessment you will be given an INC (incomplete) until such time as the assessment component is completed. <strong>Missed mandatory lab components in Optom 262 will have to be made up outside of lab time and most likely in the student's own time. </strong>In most instances quizzes will not be reopened if missed.</li></ul><p><strong>COMMITMENT EXPECTATIONS: </strong></p><p><strong>Class attendance: </strong>not mandatory but expected. Students are responsible for all material presented in class including content not included in the handouts, and changes and additions to laboratories not included in the course description. Some classes will have an assigned reading and/or video to review in the student's own time prior to class. These activities will be posted/indicated in advance.</p><p><strong>Labs</strong>: Prep time will be required before each lab. The time required will vary from student to student, but each student should sufficiently plan to read the lab instructions ahead of time (posted to LEARN weekly), and to complete any assigned readings and/or videos. For the database examination labs, examining students are required to set a goal in advance of arrival. Time outside of lab is likely required for all students to practice clinical techniques and to complete the weekly lab assignments. </p><p><strong>Lab assignments: </strong><i><strong>Recognize that each student has 3 in-lab opportunities to practice running through a full OVA in the allotted time before the final lab examination. Your preparedness, practice outside of lab time and personal plan for efficiency and self-development will play important roles in maximizing these opportunities.</strong></i></p><p>During labs 2 and 4 (or 3 and 5), you will do a full oculo-visual assessment (OVA) on an assigned classmate (partner assignments will be posted on LEARN). Students will be required to set a goal ahead of each of these labs, and complete a reflection at the end of the session regarding a plan for improvement. All database tests will be performed including ones you are concurrently learning in Optom 255L. Examining students are advised to start the lab as close to the scheduled time as possible - for the 130pm session in particular this may mean arriving early to set up the exam lane; students acting as patients are similarly expected to arrive no later than the lab start time. Results should be documented in VisualEyes (under the examining student's name), the diagnosis and plan list should be completed, and the chart should be signed. Any tests not completed during the lab should be completed outside laboratory time. </p><p>During lab 8 (or 9), you will complete as much of an OVA as possible on a classmate in 1 hour and 45 minutes. Any tests not completed will need to be completed outside of lab time. The completed examination record will then be printed using the screen dump function in Visual Eyes, and handed in to Dr. Khan for review and feedback. Feedback will be given in preparation for the lab examination which will be graded for completeness, clarity, test selection etc.  </p><p>The lab examination will be conducted during labs 10 through 12. You will have 1 hour and 45 minutes to do a full examination <u>including dilation,</u> fundus biomicroscopy and BIO on an assigned classmate, and then complete, sign and print the exam record. The test selection, identification of abnormal test results and correct record keeping will be graded for the lab examination.  </p><p><strong>Lab quizzes: </strong>There are 8 graded quizzes. Quizzes will be undertaken through LEARN and will remain open for 4.5 days, starting at 530pm each Wednesday. These should take 20-30 minutes each. <strong>Quizzes that are not submitted by the deadline will receive a mark of zero and will not be reopened for completion.</strong> The final grade will be the average of all the quizzes, which will be given equal weighting. <strong> </strong>You can repeat the quizzes twice, but the mark for each quiz will be based on an average of the percentage correct answers. The quizzes are primarily a learning (formative) exercise and you will gain the most benefit by working on them by yourself.</p>

<p><strong>MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT</strong></p><p><strong>I encourage you to seek mental health support when you need it, and not to leave reaching out until you are in crisis.</strong> The University offers Counselling Services to optometry students via Susan Corkill, the Faculty of Science counsellor. If your schedule does not work with Susan's, or if you require a different counsellor, you can and should still connect with Counselling Services (scroll down to the "Wellness" section of information (grey box) for details about how to make an appointment with Susan). </p><p>Free services available 24/7:</p><ul><li>Good2Talk: Free confidential help line for post-secondary students / 1-866-925-5454</li><li>Here 24/7: Mental health and crisis service team / 1-844-437-3247</li><li>Empower Me: Mental health and wellness service: https://wusa.ca/services/student-supports/empower-me/</li></ul><p>Crisis Support: </p><ul><li>Here 24/7: Mental health and crisis service team / 1-844-437-3247</li><li>Suicide Crisis Helpline/Crisis Services Canada: 988</li><li>IMPACT (UW Constable Services, available Thurs afternoons to 1159pm Sunday): 519 888 4911</li></ul><p>Important additional resources (off campus)</p><ul><li>OK2BME: 2SLLGBTQIA+ support in Waterloo / 519-884-0000 ext 213</li><li>Kitchener-Waterloo Sexual Assault Support Centre: 519-741-8633</li><li>Grand River Hospital: 519-742-3611</li><li>St. Mary’s Hospital: 519-744-3311</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>ACCOMMODATIONS</strong></p><ul><li>If you require accommodations to lessen the impact of a disability or medical condition, <strong>or if you feel the latter will affect your ability to sit as a patient in this course, </strong>you should register with AccessAbility Services <strong>immediately</strong> (https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/) <strong>and/or contact me.</strong></li><li>I welcome feedback regarding my accessibility awareness and possibilities for accommodation for persons with disabilities. If you have a concern in this regard, please let me or the undergraduate office know right away.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE POLICY:</strong></p><p><strong>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as writing personal reflections regarding improvement as well as a letter-writing activity.</strong> Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
