Failure to meet all 9 essential requirements by the end of OPTOM 348B will result in an automatic grade of 32% for the course.</p><p><i>*Students returning to the program after an absence will be assumed to have the technical skills competencies that were in place when they were last in the program.  On return to the program, the student will need to demonstrate that they can meet all nine essential safety requirements on their direct care patients in clinic to earn ‘Meets Essential Requirements’ status.  </i>  </p><p>Students that have not yet achieved the ‘Meets Essential Requirements’ or has a status revoked during the term must:</p><p>(a) Ensure the supervisor is present when necessary</p><p>(b) Ensure that essential requirements that need confirmation by the supervisor are completed before proceeding with a technique</p><p>Failure to do either (a) or (b) will result in the student being assessed as failing to meet professional conduct (‘professional NO’) for each essential requirement where the supervisor was not consulted.</p><p>To obtain a ‘Meets Essential Requirements’ status, the student will have been observed on 3 consecutive patients as meeting the standard. </p><p>Essential requirements are carried across all courses with direct patient care. If a student has the status ‘Meets Essential Requirements’ but subsequently fails to meet an essential requirement in any of the 9 activities, they must re-obtain the status. If the activity for which the status is being sought is one of 3, 6, 7, 8, &amp; 9, the student must therefore have the supervisor in the room for observation <i><u>before</u></i> completing the essential requirement. </p><p>In a case when a student feels they may be unable to carry out the essential requirement and patient safety is at risk; the student will not perform the technique and immediately seek help from their clinic supervisor. Clinic supervisors are responsible to uphold essential requirements by confirming they are performed on each patient.</p><p><u>Essential Requirement Protocol and Status Form</u></p><p>At the beginning of each assigned PC clinic day (UW or HSOC) students must present their Essential Requirement Status to their clinic supervisor. <i>Note: for the first day of OPTOM 348B, please show final status from OPTOM 348A. </i> Throughout the clinic day, students are expected to record <i><strong>all verbal feedback </strong></i>and complete essential requirement status once patient care is complete. At the end of the clinic day, students should present their Essential Requirement Status Form to their clinical supervisor for review and signature. Once signed, the Essential Requirement Status Form panel must be complete on PebblePad. Failure to complete the panel within 1 business day following the assigned PC clinic day will result in the student being assessed as failing to meet professional responsibilities (‘professional NO’). </p><p><strong>Course Requirements: </strong></p><p>The administrative requirements and educational objectives for each clinic can be found in the OPTOM 348B Learn Site. </p><p><strong>Student Assignment:</strong></p><p>Student clinic assignment schedule emailed on the week prior to beginning of fall term.  <i>Note:</i> students are expected to report to PC clinic <strong>1 hour BEFORE</strong> first anticipated patient appointment; regardless, if a patient has been scheduled.

The final course grade is the average of the daily grades.</p><p>The evaluation tool is used for all clinical rotations.  Five clinical skills are assessed using continuous scales (40 to 100%) and eight clinical behaviours are assessed using categorical (yes/no) scales. </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Clinical Skills           </strong></td><td><strong> Clinical Behaviours</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Case History &amp; Counselling     </td><td>Professional responsibilities</td></tr><tr><td>Technical Ability*      </td><td>Self-improvement and adaptability</td></tr><tr><td>Diagnosis/Management</td><td>Relationships with patient and family</td></tr><tr><td>Record Keeping    </td><td>Relationships with health care team</td></tr><tr><td>Efficiency      </td><td>Infection control</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Professional attire/appearance</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Examination room organization</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>On-site policies and professional college regulations</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>* The Technical Ability scale includes skills in:</p><ul><li>General Care, Ocular Disease, Refraction, Oculomotor-Sensory and Ocular Health</li><li>Optical Services: Repairs and Adjustments, Frame Selection, and Lens Design</li></ul><p>Clinical skills are evaluated using a non-compensatory method.  That is, an extraordinarily poor or strong performance on one patient of the day will determine the grade in that skill.  For example, if on a given day the ocular health technical skills were generally acceptable for 3 patients, but a retinal detachment was missed on one patient, the grade would be poor (i.e., 40% using the descriptors).  Alternatively, if the performance was generally acceptable on 3 patients but the student found a retinal lesion using scleral indentation, the grade would be high (i.e., 100% using the descriptors). </p><p>Evaluations are submitted electronically by the clinical supervisors. Once submitted, students have access to their grades online. The online evaluation system is accessed through www.optometry.uwaterloo.ca. In all cases, written and oral feedback is expected from the clinical supervisor, and must be given for any grade below 70%.  The clinical supervisor uses the behavioural descriptors provided to grade the student. These descriptors have been modified for each clinic. At any time, students can request a meeting with the course instructor to discuss a particular clinic evaluation. </p><p>The clinical behaviours are not used in the initial grade calculation but repeated patterns of ‘No’ behaviours will have an academic consequence. Please see Table 1. Once, the student has received 3 “NO’s” they will meet with the course instructor.    During a meeting, the course instructor will review the inappropriate behaviours, the student’s perspective will be heard and the expectations for appropriate behaviour will be reviewed.   </p><p><i><strong>Table 1: Academic Consequence of Clinical Behaviour 'No' Evaluations</strong></i></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Consequences</strong></td><td><strong>Critical Number of 'No' Evaluations</strong></td></tr><tr><td>No course grade change</td><td>1 - 2</td></tr><tr><td>Meet with student; no course grade change</td><td>3 - 4</td></tr><tr><td>Meet with student; 5% final course grade deduction</td><td>5 - 7</td></tr><tr><td>Meet with student; additional 5% final course grade deduction</td><td>8 - 9</td></tr><tr><td>Meet with student; failing course grade (grade automatically reverts to 32%)</td><td>10 or more</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Frequency &amp; Weight of Evaluation:</strong></p><p>The written student evaluation tool is completed for each direct patient care assignment.  The clinical supervisor completes the evaluation by assigning a grade to each of the clinical skills and indicates ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to each of the clinical behaviours (a not applicable [NA] evaluation on the technical skills scale may be appropriate in some cases).  Each evaluation has the same weight in determining a course component grade.</p><p><strong>Final Course Grade:</strong></p><p>The final course grade will include all submitted evaluations. Successful completion of OPTOM 348B depends on meeting the following standards:</p><ul><li>Overall passing grade:           70%</li></ul><p>Although students are not required to achieve 70% in individual clinic assignments, weak performances will be identified, and students will be required to meet with the course instructor to discuss the performance. <i>The overall grade for OPTOM 348B is determined by the clinical skills and clinic behaviour evaluations submitted throughout the term.</i></p><p>Repeat failure of OPTOM 348B will follow the policies as outlined by the University of Waterloo.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>ABSENCE FROM COURSE ACTIVITIES </strong></p><p>All activities in OPTOM 348B are mandatory. </p><p><strong>Absences:</strong></p><p>Intern attendance is mandatory for all clinical assignments and is a requirement even if there are no pre-booked appointments. This course follows the principles outlined in the Attendance Policy below. An intern must make-up all missed clinic time (this includes partial and complete missed days). There are no exceptions. Time will be made-up according to the following guideline:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Clinic Absence</strong></td><td><strong>Make-Up Time (assigned in clinic area missed)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Each full day</td><td>Full day</td></tr><tr><td>Each partial day (more than half-day)</td><td>Full day</td></tr><tr><td>Each partial day (less than half day)</td><td>Half day</td></tr><tr><td>Each late start  (&gt; 45 mins from expected arrival to clinic)</td><td>Half day</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Unplanned Absences:</strong></p><p>Unplanned (e.g. illness including symptoms related to Covid-19, car trouble etc.) absences from clinic must be reported in accordance to the Attendance Policy. This involves sending the Unplanned Absence Notification Form to the Undergraduate Studies Administrator and informing the Clinic Operations Manager email at the earliest possible time.  In cases of illness, a Verification of Illness Form (VIF) is required for absences that are at minimum of 2 consecutive days (ie. if clinic day is Tuesday, VIF required if also absent the Monday). Unplanned lateness must be reported to the Clinic Operations Manager and course instructor immediately by email.  Failure to notify the Optometry Clinic will result in a Clinical Behaviour “No” for not following clinic policy. </p><p><strong>Planned Absences:</strong></p><p>Application for planned absences (e.g., academic meetings, board examinations, wedding, etc.) must be made in accordance with the Attendance Policy to the Undergraduate Studies Administrator <strong><u>at least four weeks</u></strong> in advance of the clinical assignment or as soon as the special circumstance is known.        </p><p>In most cases, make-up time should be completed in the term in which it was accumulated. In exceptional circumstances, it may be possible to hold over make-up time from one term to another with the course instructor’s approval. If approved, interns may make-up time prior to a planned absence or during regular term time. These cases are dependent on availability of resources and will be treated on a case-by-case basis. In cases where an intern is in good standing but has not made up missed clinic time an “Incomplete” (INC) will be assigned for OPT 348B.  The intern will not be allowed to proceed into the following term until all course requirements are complete.  </p><p><strong>Attendance Policy:</strong></p><p>The School of Optometry and Vision Science has an attendance policy for mandatory course activities that is centrally administrated by the Undergraduate Studies Committee. </p><p>The policy describes:</p><ul><li>How to apply for approval for a planned absence from a mandatory activity</li><li>How to notify of an unplanned absence from a mandatory activity</li></ul><p>The Committee will notify you in their response of the approved accommodations or consequences of missing the activity</p><ul><li>All absences from mandatory activities must be submitted to the Committee</li><li>You <strong>must not </strong>attempt to make separate arrangements with the course, lab or clinic instructor</li></ul><p><strong>Online Submission for Absence Request</strong></p><ul><li>The forms for submitting an absence request/notification can be found here:</li></ul><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/current-students/optometry-student-resources">           https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/current-students/optometry-student-resources</a></p><p><strong>Documentation of Illness</strong></p><ul><li>On occasions when you are unwell and unable to attend a mandatory activity, you must obtain documentation from the University of Waterloo Health Services. You will be asked to submit paperwork verifying your condition to the Optometry Program Manager (<a href="mailto:optometry.ugc@uwaterloo.ca">optometry.ugc@uwaterloo.ca)</a></li><li>Please see the following link for information on the University of Waterloo Verification of Illness Form (VIF) if you are on campus:</li></ul><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic">           https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic</a></p><p><strong>Consequences of a Missed Clinic Day</strong></p><ul><li>Where a student requests a planned absence, or notifies an unplanned absence from an assigned clinic day, a make-up day in the clinic area missed will be assigned<strong><u> at the end of the term exam period</u></strong>. Failure to complete all course requirements for OPTOM 348B, will result in an INC for the course and will delay the start of OPTOM 348B.</li></ul><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT OF INTERNS</strong></p><p>UW Doctor of Optometry Program Mission: <i>“to graduate competent, ethical Doctors of Optometry by providing them with a comprehensive and contemporary optometric education”</i></p><p>Consistent with this mission, the UW Doctor of Optometry program has identified goals for the program.  One such goal is to “provide high quality optometric education which will prepare graduates to provide independent contemporary optometric services in an ethical and professional manner”.  OPT 348B contributes greatly to the School’s ability to reach its goal of preparing graduates to meet these goals. </p><p>Consistent with University Policies #33 Ethical Behaviour and #71 Academic Student Discipline, interns are expected to: </p><ul><li>conduct themselves with honesty and integrity at all times;</li><li>act professionally and respectfully toward clinic instructors, staff members, patients and colleagues;</li><li>put, in most cases, the needs of the patients before their own;</li><li>make themselves aware of, and adhere to, clinic policies;</li><li>be available for clinic assignment, complete all assigned responsibilities and follow the directives of their clinical teachers;</li><li>demonstrate an interest in self-improvement;</li><li>familiarize themselves with, and adhere to, the professional conduct sections as outlined by the College of Optometrists of Ontario</li></ul><p>Interns who anticipate problems in adhering to policies as required are encouraged to speak to the course instructor. </p><p><strong>Complaints:</strong></p><p>If the Clinic receives a complaint about professional misconduct by the intern, the intern will be notified of the complaint and provided with an opportunity to respond. The Clinic Director and course instructor will conduct a review. If there is sufficient evidence to indicate a breach of policy #33 or #71 the matter will be referred to the Optometry Undergraduate Committee for further investigation. If there is sufficient, evidence to indicate that the safety of patients or clinic personnel are at risk the Optometry Undergraduate Committee will consult with the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies and the Secretariat and Office of General Counsel. After such consultations, an interim suspension may be invoked until the matter has been resolved by the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies including all appeals. Interim suspension may range from suspension from clinic duties to a complete ban from campus activity. Decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis and the term, conditions and limitations will be conveyed to the intern in writing at the time the suspension is imposed.</p><p> </p><p><strong>MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT:</strong></p><p>Everyone needs a support system.  The faculty and staff in Science encourage students to seek mental health supports, when they need them.</p><p><i><strong>On Campus</strong></i></p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services/uw-mates-peer-support"><i>Counselling Services</i></a><i>: 519-888-4567 ext 32655</i></li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic"><i>Health Services Student Medical Clinic</i></a><i>: 519-888-4096</i></li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services/uw-mates-peer-support"><i>MATES</i></a><i>: one-to-one peer support program (NH North); Health Services (2<sup>nd</sup> floor)</i></li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/police/"><i>UW Police</i></a><i>: 519-888-4567 ext. 22222</i></li></ul><p><i>Off Campus</i></p><ul><li><a href="https://good2talk.ca/"><i>Good2Talk</i></a><i>: Free confidential help line for post-secondary students / 1-866-925-5454</i></li><li><a href="http://here247.ca/"><i>Here 24/7</i></a><i>: Mental health and crisis service team / 1-844-437-3247</i></li><li><a href="http://www.crisisservicescanada.ca/en/"><i>Crisis Services Canada</i></a><i>: 1-833-456-4566 / text 45645</i></li><li><a href="https://ok2bme.ca/"><i>OK2BME</i></a><i>: support services for LGBTQ teens in Waterloo / 519-884-0000 ext 213</i></li><li><a href="http://www.sascwr.org/"><i>Kitchener-Waterloo Sexual Assault Support Centre</i></a><i>: 519-741-8633</i></li><li><a href="http://www.grhosp.on.ca/"><i>Grand River Hospital</i></a><i>: 519-742-3611</i></li><li><a href="http://www.smgh.ca/"><i>St. Mary’s Hospital</i></a><i>: 519-744-3311</i></li></ul><p> </p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
