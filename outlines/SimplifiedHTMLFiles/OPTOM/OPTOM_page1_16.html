<h3>Association with OPTOM 152 Lecture Course</h3><p>The material covered in this clinical practice lab is supported by the content of the OPTOM 152 lecture course. It is helpful to make connections between the practical and theoretical material by reviewing the lab activities in the context of the theory covered in class. </p><h3>Mandatory Course Elements</h3><ul><li>Attendance at all assigned laboratory sessions</li><li>Final assessment</li></ul><h3>Your Responsibilities for this course are:</h3><h4>Before the Lab</h4><ul><li>Read the required sections of the <u>Procedures in Clinical Optometry</u> manual. Bring the manual to lab.</li><li>View the relevant PowerPoint presentations, video demonstrations and/or other materials for that week's lab. This will allow you to arrive ready to perform the new techniques each week</li><li>Remove your contact lenses if you are a contact lens wearer and present to the lab in your glasses</li></ul><h4>During the Lab</h4><ul><li>You will be assigned to a different partner each week (see lab schedule on LEARN). During the session, you will take turns being the assessor and patient</li><li>Each lab session is 3 hours. Use this time! Begin with techniques from the preceding session before moving on to the new techniques for the week.</li><li>Practice professional behaviour - you should act in lab as you would in clinic. Arrive on time, maintain dress code (<strong>scrubs as the outermost layer + name tags; no hoodies/jackets/sweaters over scrubs</strong>), no outdoor shoes (winter boots)/flip flops or open-toed shoes, masks if you required or appropriate, use professional language, and maintain the dignity of those around you (both your peers and instructors). If you fail to observe these, you will be reminded once, and on any further occasions, will be asked to leave the lab.</li><li>Expected care of equipment: It is critical to maintain clinical equipment, a skill you will use daily in clinical practice. Clean and cover the equipment at the end of the laboratory session. Do not throw the equipment covers on the floor but rather place them inside the cabinets when not in use (dirty covers do not protect the equipment). If a piece of equipment is not functioning properly, notify one of the lab demonstrators, who may be able to solve the problem on the spot. Failing that, call or e-mail the School’s equipment technician, Colin McLaren. Colin can be reached at extension 46275 or at <a href="mailto:colin.mclaren@uwaterloo.ca"><u>colin.mclaren@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> . Inform him of the booth number, the piece of equipment and the issue. Addressing issues in a timely manner will prevent them from propagating to the next week.</li><li>Expected treatment of your patient: maintain patient confidentiality. <strong>Do not share clinical findings with classmates.</strong> During the case history lab, "patients" are encouraged to be as accurate as possible, but have the right to withhold information they are uncomfortable sharing with a classmate. <strong>Record all of your findings under the examiners name in VisualEyes.</strong></li><li>Practice consistent infection control and prevention. All chairs, stands, counter surfaces, and other articles that will contact the patient or the examiner MUST be disinfected with wipes as provided in the lab at the beginning of each lab session and with each change of patient/examiner. Wash your hands before examining your subject. Swab contact surfaces of the equipment with an alcohol swab before using the piece of equipment on a subject. Clean your small hand-held equipment regularly with soap and water. Throw all used tissues and alcohol swabs in the garbage baskets provided. Cap all solutions that are not in use.</li></ul><h4>After the Lab</h4><ul><li>Practice outside of scheduled 152 lab time <strong>is strongly recommended</strong></li><li>Sign up for the preclinic after hours is available through the WLRC</li><li><strong><u>You may only practice on other optometry students</u>.</strong> This will avoid determining conditions that were previously unknown to the subject. Communicating a diagnosis is a restricted act and can only be done by a licensed practitioner.</li><li>Please follow laboratory guidelines in the event of an adverse incident when practicing after hours.</li><li>Keeping in mind protocols during the COVID pandemic, you are encouraged to work with as many partners as possible to broaden your exposure to individual variations in responses to test procedures.</li></ul><p> </p>

<p>The lab portion of Optometry 152 is a separate course in itself (OPTOM 152L) which must be completed successfully as a pre-requisite for further clinical optometry courses. <strong>The course is graded on a Credit/Non-Credit basis, with provision of a credit contingent upon: </strong></p><p>1) Successful demonstration of adequate proficiency on specific skills when demonstrated to one of the laboratory instructors during a lab session. This assessment will consist of the student demonstrating PD measurement, Distance and Near VA’s, and Push-up amplitude of accommodation to the lab instructor using his/her assigned lab partner as patient. The instructor will provide feedback and assistance as needed to satisfy themselves that the student has demonstrated competency in the technique before granting credit for the procedure. <strong>If critical mistakes are made, the student will be re-assessed by a different instructor the following week until competency is demonstrated. </strong></p><p>2) Successful demonstration of adequate competency on the required test procedures on the final practical examination. This will consist of retinoscopy (both eyes), monocular subjective refraction (both eyes), and binocular balancing (by prism balancing or, if indicated, bichrome test). This will be done on a randomly assigned lab partner whose identity will not be known to the student prior to the examination. Each student will be allowed 25 minutes to complete the examination. The results of the findings must be entered into VisualEyes. Due to time constraints, no verbal feedback will be given to the candidates during or immediately following the examination; however, students’ grades and written comments from the examiner will be returned to them soon after the examination. </p><p>On the final practical, each technique assessed will be assigned a grade of either ‘unacceptable’ or ‘acceptable’. The descriptors for each grade are as follows: </p><p><strong>Unacceptable</strong> – The candidate makes critical error(s) that significantly affects the validity of the outcome and/or the well-being of the subject. The candidate has demonstrated a lack of understanding of the test procedure.  </p><p><strong>Acceptable</strong> – The candidate performs test without serious error. </p><p>Where an ‘unacceptable’ grading is obtained, the student will be given a subsequent opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in the technique. <strong>If the performance remains 'unacceptable' then a grade of No Credit will be assigned. </strong></p><p> </p>

<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions.

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
