<h4><strong>Assessment</strong></h4><p><strong>Course Requirements:</strong></p><p>The course requirements and educational objectives for each clinic can be found in the <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/le/content/684589/viewContent/3915787/View">OPTOM 478 Learn Site</a>. </p><p><strong>Calculation of Course Grade:</strong></p><p>Each clinical skills component is assigned a numerical grade (see below); the average of the clinical components is the calculated grade for the day. The final course grade is the average of the daily grades.</p><p>The evaluation tool is used for all clinical rotations.  Five clinical skills are assessed using continuous scales (40 to 100%) and eight clinical behaviours are assessed using categorical (yes/no) scales. </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Clinical Skills           </strong></td><td><strong> Clinical Behaviours</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Case History &amp; Counselling     </td><td>Professional responsibilities</td></tr><tr><td>Technical Ability*      </td><td>Self-improvement and adaptability</td></tr><tr><td>Diagnosis/Management</td><td>Relationships with patient and family</td></tr><tr><td>Record Keeping    </td><td>Relationships with health care team</td></tr><tr><td>Efficiency      </td><td>Infection control</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Professional attire/appearance</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Examination room organization</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>On-site policies and professional college regulations</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>* The Technical Ability scale includes skills in:</p><ul><li>General Care, Ocular Disease, Habilitation Services: Refraction, Oculomotor-Sensory and Ocular Health</li><li>Optical Services: Repairs and Adjustments, Frame Selection, and Lens Design</li><li>Contact Lens: Refraction, Contact Lens Fitting, and Ocular Health.</li></ul><p>Clinical skills are evaluated using a non-compensatory method.  That is, an extraordinarily poor or strong performance on one patient of the day will determine the grade in that skill.  For example, if on a given day the ocular health technical skills were generally acceptable for 3 patients, but a retinal detachment was missed on one patient, the grade would be poor (i.e., 40% using the descriptors).  Alternatively, if the performance was generally acceptable on 3 patients but the intern found a retinal lesion using scleral indentation, the grade would be high (i.e., 100% using the descriptors).</p><p>Evaluations are submitted electronically by the clinical supervisors. Once submitted, interns have access to their grades online. The online evaluation system is accessed through www.optometry.uwaterloo.ca. In all cases, written and oral feedback is expected from the clinical teacher, and must be given for any grade below 70%.  The clinical teacher uses the behavioural descriptors provided to grade the intern. These descriptors have been modified for each clinic. At any time interns can request a meeting with the clinic director to discuss a particular clinic evaluation. </p><p>The clinical behaviours are not used in the initial grade calculation but repeated patterns of ‘No’ behaviours will have an academic consequence (Table 1). Once, the student has received at least 3 “NO’s” they will meet with the course instructor.    During the meeting, the course instructor will review the inappropriate behaviours, the student’s perspective will be heard, and the expectations for appropriate behaviour will be reviewed.   </p><p><i><strong>Table 1: Academic Consequence of Clinical Behaviour 'No' Evaluations</strong></i></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Consequences</strong></td><td><strong>Critical Number of 'No' Evaluations</strong></td></tr><tr><td>No course grade change</td><td>1 - 2</td></tr><tr><td>Meet with student; no course grade change</td><td>3 - 4</td></tr><tr><td>Meet with student; 5% final course grade deduction</td><td>5 - 7</td></tr><tr><td>Meet with student; additional 5% final course grade deduction</td><td>8 - 9</td></tr><tr><td>Meet with student; failing course grade (grade automatically reverts to 32%)</td><td>10 or more</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Frequency &amp; Weight of Evaluation:</strong></p><p>The electronic student evaluation tool is completed on periodic days.  The clinical instructor (optometrist or optician) completes the evaluation by assigning a grade to each of the clinical skills and indicates ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to each of the clinical behaviours (a not applicable [NA] evaluation on the technical skills scale may be appropriate in some cases).  Each evaluation has the same weight in determining a course component grade.    </p><p><strong>Clinical Based Discussions (Virtual, Synchronous):</strong></p><p>Students may be assigned a clinical based discussion day in lieu of direct patient care. Clinical discussions focus on patient cases related to the specialty clinic area.  Each session will be scheduled for an entire clinic day beginning at 9am. A meeting link will be sent to you ahead of your virtual clinic assignment or instructions regarding the virtual assignment will be posted on OPTOM 478 Learn no later than 9am. Attendance and assignment submission is mandatory. For all virtual case discussions, students are asked to have their video on to facilitate group discussion. .  </p><p><strong>Final Course Grade:</strong></p><p>The final course grade will include all submitted ESES evaluations.  Successful completion of OPTOM 478 depends on meeting the following standards:</p><ul><li>Overall passing grade:         70%</li></ul><p>Although interns are not required to achieve 70% in individual clinic assignments, weak performances will be identified and the intern will be required to meet with the course instructor to discuss the performance.  <i>The overall grade for OPTOM 478 is determined by the clinical skills and clinic behaviour evaluations submitted throughout the term.</i></p><p>Repeat failure of OPTOM 478 will follow the policies as outlined by the University of Waterloo.</p><h4><strong>Commitment Expectations/Student Assignment</strong></h4><p><strong>Regular Patient Hours:</strong></p><p>Assigned regular clinic hours: please reference student clinic schedule.  <i>Note:</i> students are expected to report to clinic <strong>1 hour BEFORE</strong> first anticipated patient appointment, regardless if a patient has been scheduled.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4><strong>Absence from Course Activities </strong></h4><p>All activities in OPTOM 478 are mandatory. </p><p><strong>Absences:</strong></p><p>Intern attendance is mandatory for all clinical assignments and is a requirement even if there are no pre-booked appointments. This course follows the principles outlined in the Attendance Policy below. An intern must make-up all missed clinic time (this includes partial and complete missed days). There are no exceptions. Time will be made-up according to the following guideline:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Clinic Absence</strong></td><td><strong>Make-Up Time (assigned in clinic area missed)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Each full day</td><td>Full day</td></tr><tr><td>Each partial day (more than half-day)</td><td>Full day</td></tr><tr><td>Each partial day (less than half day)</td><td>Half day</td></tr><tr><td>Each late start  (&gt; 30 mins from expected arrival to clinic)</td><td>Half day</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Unplanned Absences:</strong></p><p>Unplanned absences (e.g. illness including symptoms related to Covid-19, car trouble etc.) from clinic must be reported in accordance to the Attendance Policy. This involves sending the Unplanned Absence Notification Form to the Undergraduate Studies Administrator and informing the Clinic Operations Manager by email at the earliest possible time.  In cases of illness, a Verification of Illness Form (VIF) is required for absences that are 2 consecutive days or longer. Unplanned lateness must be reported to the Clinic immediately by telephone.  Failure to notify the Optometry Clinic will result in a Clinical Behaviour “No” for not following clinic policy. </p><p><strong>Planned Absences:</strong></p><p>Application for planned absences (e.g., academic meetings, board examinations, wedding, etc.) must be made in accordance with the Attendance Policy to the Undergraduate Studies Administrator <strong><u>at least four weeks</u></strong> in advance of the clinical assignment or as soon as the special circumstance is known.        </p><p>In most cases, clinic make-up is completed following the end of the term in which it was accumulated. In exceptional circumstances, it may be possible to hold over make-up time from one term to another with the course instructor’s approval and the intern will be scheduled at the end of the following term (i.e. spring make up complete at the end of fall term).  These cases are dependent on availability of resources and will be treated on a case-by-case basis. In cases where an intern is in good standing but has not made up missed clinic time an “Incomplete” (INC) will be assigned for OPTOM 478.  The intern will not be allowed to graduate until all 478 course requirements are complete.  </p><p><strong>Attendance Policy:</strong></p><ul><li>The School of Optometry and Vision Science has an attendance policy for mandatory course activities that is centrally administrated by the Undergraduate Studies Committee.</li><li>The policy describes:</li><li>How to apply for approval for a planned absence from a mandatory activity</li><li>How to notify of an unplanned absence from a mandatory activity</li><li>The Committee will notify you in their response of the approved accommodations or consequences of missing the activity</li><li>All absences from mandatory activities must be submitted to the Committee</li><li>You <strong>must not </strong>attempt to make separate arrangements with the course or clinic instructor or an administrator</li></ul><p><strong>Online Submission for Absence Request:</strong></p><ul><li>The forms for submitting an absence request/notification can be found here: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/current-students/optometry-student-resources"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/current-students/optometry-student-resources</u></a></li></ul><p><strong>Documentation of Illness:</strong></p><ul><li>If you miss a mandatory activity due to illness, you may be asked to submit to Marie Amodeo paperwork verifying your medical condition.</li><li>Please see the following link for information on the University of Waterloo Verification of Illness Form (VIF):<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic"><u> https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic</u></a></li></ul><p><strong>Consequences of a missed graded element:</strong></p><ul><li>Where a student requests a planned absence, or notifies an unplanned absence from a mandatory activity, attempts will be made to accommodate the absence. In the event that the request cannot be accommodated, the missed graded element will be added to the weight of the final examination. If the missed mandatory is a final examination, you will be given an INC until such time as the assessment is completed.</li></ul><p> </p><h3><strong>Professional Conduct of Interns</strong></h3><p>UW Doctor of Optometry Program Mission: <i>“to graduate competent, ethical Doctors of Optometry by providing them with a comprehensive and contemporary optometric education”</i></p><p>Consistent with this mission, the UW Doctor of Optometry program has identified goals for the program.  One such goal is to “provide high quality optometric education which will prepare graduates to provide independent contemporary optometric services in an ethical and professional manner”.  OPT 478 contributes greatly to the School’s ability to reach its goal of preparing graduates to meet these goals. </p><p>Consistent with University Policies #33 Ethical Behaviour and #71 Academic Student Discipline, interns are expected to: </p><ul><li>conduct themselves with honesty and integrity at all times;</li><li>act professionally and respectfully toward clinic instructors, staff members, patients and colleagues;</li><li>put, in most cases, the needs of the patients before their own;</li><li>make themselves aware of, and adhere to, clinic policies;</li><li>be available for clinic assignment, complete all assigned responsibilities and follow the directives of their clinical teachers;</li><li>demonstrate an interest in self-improvement;</li><li>familiarize themselves with, and adhere to, the professional conduct sections as outlined by the College of Optometrists of Ontario</li></ul><p>Interns who anticipate problems in adhering to policies as required are encouraged to speak to the course instructor. </p><p><strong>Complaints:</strong></p><p>If the Clinic receives a complaint about professional misconduct by the intern, the intern will be notified of the complaint and provided with an opportunity to respond. The Clinic Director and course instructor will conduct a review. If there is sufficient evidence to indicate a breach of policy #33 or #71 the matter will be referred to the Associate Director Academics for further investigation. If there is sufficient, evidence to indicate that the safety of patients or clinic personnel are at risk the intern will be temporarily suspended from direct patient encounters until the matter is reviewed by the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies. </p><h4><strong>Mental Health Support:</strong></h4><p>Everyone needs a support system.  The faculty and staff in Science encourage students to seek mental health supports, when they need them. If you are in need of Counselling Services, we will have a counsellor (Cecilia Braga) available at the School of Optometry and Vision Science once a week on <strong>Tuesdays</strong> for the duration of this term. Meetings with the counsellor are usually by appointment in room <strong>OPT 157</strong> until the move to the interim clinic (while the WEI is built). Cecilia also has meeting space in Health Services. </p><p>To book an appointment, please call Campus Wellness 519-888-4096 ext. 2 (8:30 am-4:30 pm) where an Intake Specialist will help you to connect with Cecilia or another counsellor. </p><p><strong>Contact information </strong></p><p>Campus Wellness: Weekdays 8:30-4:30: Counselling Services 519-888-4096 ext. 2</p><p>For urgent or after hours help:</p><ul><li>Here 24/7: 1-844-437-3247</li><li>Good2Talk: 1-866-925-5454/text 686868</li><li>Suicide Crisis Helpline: 988 (call or text)</li><li>Emergency services: 911</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.

  University Policy

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
