<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Through observations of verbal and non-verbal interactions in a clinical setting, literature review, and through group participation discussing an IPC case, students are asked to (1) reflect on the role optometry plays within a healthcare team, and (2) reflect and discuss how the healthcare system contributes to and can become an ally for discrimination, barriers to accessibility, and health inequities.</p><p> </p>
</div>
<a></a>
<h2>
  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Describe, discuss, and reflect upon optometry in the context of the healthcare structure and systems, and in doing so consider how these systems contribute to and can become an ally for discrimination, barriers to accessibility, and health inequities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Describe, discuss and reflect upon the role of an optometrist and the contributions they make to the healthcare team.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Understand the services and community supports available for patients.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Develop an understanding of and adhere to professionals ethics, etiquette, communication</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Articulate thoughts in a coherent and professional manner through group participation and reflective writing</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div>
<span>In addition, the learning objectives of the course are also meant to serve as transformational skills: </span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>To gain interpersonal communication skills: a) be able to reflect on your communication with different people and audiences; b) be able to formulate strategies to enhance communication</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div>
<span>Background:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Many individuals face discrimination, barriers to accessibility and health inequities when seeking care from the health care system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Strategies to address health inequities must be applied comprehensively and systematically throughout the healthcare system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This underscores the importance of providing culturally safe care in the optometric setting, as students/interns have the potential to provide a positive experience to patients, by providing culturally safe care – for example, Indigenous persons and recognizing and valuing traditional healing practices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Partnership with and interprofessional collaboration with targeted health care teams and community supports improves health care outcomes and access to care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Health interventions can be improved when they are holistic and informed by cultural knowledge, which is aided by recognizing, respecting and working with community experts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Health interventions can also be improved when decisions are made collaboratively as a healthcare team.</td>
</tr>

  University Policy

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
