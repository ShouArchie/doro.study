<h2>
  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Describe, discuss and reflect upon how patients process and react to a clinical diagnosis and how this influences the type of care received</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Describe, discuss, and reflect upon cross-cultural communication as reported in literature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Develop an understanding of and adhere to professionals ethics, etiquette, communication</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Articulate thoughts in a coherent and professional manner through group participation and reflective writing</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div>
<span>In addition, the learning objectives of the course are also meant to serve as transformational skills: </span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>To gain interpersonal communication skills: a) be able to reflect on your communication with different people and audiences; b) be able to formulate strategies to enhance communication</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div>
<span>Term Focus:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Regardful care — health professionals deliver patient centered care, which does not diminish, demean or disempower the patient, and which incorporates the patient’s unique cultural background, and the withholding of information can contribute to feelings of patient powerlessness and consequently lead to care that is not person centered (1, 2). It is important for information to be delivered to patients in a way that they understand and in which promotes a safe-space for them to ask questions (2). In contrast, open, empathetic and authentic communication leads to beneficial patient-(health) practitioner interactions where the patient feels heard and respected (1,2). Patients have identified that when practitioners work to dismantle the power structure within health care, it opens the door for honest communication and patient understanding (1). Having students reflect on verbal and non-verbal communication, and the power dynamics within the optometry clinic setting provides the foundation to critically reflect on what it means to provide culturally safe care (1).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Engagement and discourse — health professionals undertake appropriate engagement with patients, as defined by the patient, to understand and assist in meeting the patient’s unique needs</td>

<span>Background:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Although patients may have the same condition, the way patients process or react to a clinical experience or diagnosis may be different. As such, it is essential for optometrists to seek their patient’s guidance and explore their patient’s concerns and questions about a symptom, diagnosis or management plan. Research has demonstrated that patients often feel disheartened that their perspectives are not considered valid in the healthcare setting, even though they are the experts on their own health.</td>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
