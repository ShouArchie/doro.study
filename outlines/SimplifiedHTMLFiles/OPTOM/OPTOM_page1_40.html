<p><strong>ASSESSMENT</strong></p><p><strong>Minimum Patient Requirements:</strong></p><p>Students will be directly involved in a minimum of 25 full or partial oculovisual assessments* per week.  In addition to patient care, students are expected to engage in all areas of the practice which may include but are not limited to: pre-testing, contact lens teaching, spectacle dispensing, reception duties, meeting industry representatives, and attending office meetings. </p><p>*all oculovisual assessments should include patient testing, data interpretation, and development of a management plan.</p><p><strong>Minimum Time Requirements:</strong></p><p>Students are expected to attend clinic the equivalent of 5 days per week for at least 8 hours each day in order to receive the assigned number of credits for the course. Please note that actual hours and days of office and patient care activity are determined at the discretion of the clerkship supervisor.</p><p><strong>Course Grade Requirements:</strong></p><p>The final course grade will include all submitted evaluations. Successful completion of OPTOM 468 depends on meeting the following standard:</p><ul><li>Overall passing grade of 70% or higher (CR)*</li><li>Completion of patient logs and clerkship site evaluation</li></ul><p><i>* Credit (CR) for OPTOM 468 is granted if the student achieves an overall grade of 70% or higher. If a student receives an overall grade of less than 70% this is recorded as a failure and the student will be assigned a non-credit (NCR) for the course and follow the policies outlined by the University of Waterloo. The overall grade for OPTOM 468 is determined by the clinical skills and clinic behaviour evaluations submitted throughout the term.</i></p><p><strong>Calculation of Course Grade:</strong></p><p>Principal clerkship supervisors complete three written evaluations of the student for site durations of 15 weeks. The first evaluation considers performance over the first 5 weeks, the second evaluation considers the second 5-week block and the third evaluation considers performance over the final 5 weeks. For site durations of 7 or 8 weeks, the first evaluation considers performance during the first half and the final evaluation considers the last half. When more than one supervisor is involved, input from all clerkship supervisors contribute towards the evaluation submitted by the primary supervisor. Evaluations should include written comments in addition to the grading scale indicators.  Clerkship supervisors are encouraged to offer comprehensive and constructive feedback for improvement and should share the first and second evaluation with the student before submitting it to the RedCap Grading System. A student conference is not required for the final evaluation.</p><p>In all cases, written/oral forms of feedback to the student are expected from the clerkship supervisor.  The clerkship supervisor uses behavioural descriptors provided on the evaluation form as a guide in grading the student. The clerkship supervisor is to complete a grade for each of the clinical skills and indicate yes or no to each of the clinical behaviours. The relative weights of the clerkship evaluations are:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><p><strong>15 Week Rotation:</strong></p></td><td colspan="2"><p><strong>2 x 7/8 Week Rotation:</strong></p></td><td colspan="2"><p><strong>2 x 6/9 Week Rotation:</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Weeks 1-5</p></td><td><p>16%</p></td><td><p>Weeks 1 – 7</p></td><td><p>50%</p></td><td><p>Weeks 1 – 6</p></td><td><p>40%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Weeks 6-10</p></td><td><p>34%</p></td><td><p>Weeks 8 – 15</p></td><td><p>50%</p></td><td><p>Weeks 7 – 9</p></td><td><p>20%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Weeks 11-15</p></td><td><p>50%</p></td><td> </td><td> </td><td><p>Weeks 10 -15</p></td><td><p>40%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Grading Policy:</strong></p><p>Clinic grades are based on the following guidelines and categories:</p><p><strong><u>Clinical Behaviour:</u></strong>  ‘yes’ or ‘no’ grade assigned to each of the following behaviours;  ‘no’ indicates significant and/or repeatable breaches of professional conduct over the assessed period; may be assigned by Clerkship supervisor and/or course instructor anytime throughout the term</p><ul><li><strong>professional responsibilities met </strong><ul><li>record keeping policies of clinic/office followed</li><li>accepts clinical duties as assigned</li><li>available to examine patients when required</li></ul></li><li><strong>positive effort toward self-improvement and adaptability shown</strong><ul><li>positively accepts constructive criticism</li><li>attempts to implement suggested improvements demonstrated during the day</li></ul></li><li><strong>productive relationships with patient and families demonstrated</strong><ul><li>polite to patients and families</li><li>sensitive to needs of patients and their families</li></ul></li><li><strong>good relationships with health care team members shown</strong><ul><li>polite to supervisor, other students and staff</li><li>helpful member of healthcare team</li></ul></li><li><strong>adequate infection control demonstrated</strong><ul><li>followed infection control policy of site/office</li><li>followed infection control protocol for patient with eye infection</li></ul></li><li><strong>adequate professional attire/appearance evident</strong><ul><li>abided by site/office dress code</li><li>clothes neat, clean and task appropriate</li></ul></li><li><strong>examination room neat and organized</strong><ul><li>equipment neatly organized in examination room</li><li>papers neatly organized on examination counter</li><li>counter clear of used tissues, cotton/alcohol swabs, etc.</li></ul></li><li><strong>site policies and professional regulations followed</strong><ul><li>abided by site/office policies not specified above</li><li>abided by regional regulations governing optometric practices (e.g. no professional misconduct)</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong><u>Inappropriate Clinical Behaviour: </u> </strong>If the cumulative number of ‘no’ responses for the clinical behaviour evaluation is two or more, the clerkship supervisor should meet with the student to discuss the inappropriate behaviour and contact the course instructor.  If the cumulative number of ‘no’ responses for the clinical behaviour evaluation is three or more, a meeting will be arranged with the course instructor to discuss the evaluation and review expectations. Additionally, an academic penalty of 5% reduction in the overall grade will be applied.  If the number of ‘no’ responses for the clinical behaviour evaluation is five or more, the students final grade will automatically revert to a 32%. </p><p><strong><u>Clinical Skills</u></strong><u>: </u>Indicates the student’s level of performance by assigning a numerical grade for each area evaluated <i>(guidelines not inclusive)</i></p><ul><li><strong>case history and counselling - 40</strong>: did not elicit chief complaint; medication use not determined / <strong>70</strong>: recorded drug name but not dosage (when known by patient); identified diabetes but did not determine control level / <strong>100</strong>: able to give the news of failure of driving standards professionally and compassionately; able to obtain full history of glaucoma through a translator</li><li><strong>technical ability: refraction; oculomotor-sensory; ocular health - 40</strong>: subjective refraction incorrect by ≥ 1.00D on sphere or cyl; add incorrect by ≥ ±0.75 D; failed to identify a 20<sup>∆</sup> constant esotropia; misdiagnosed high exophoria as an alternating strabismus; missed retinal detachment on BIO; denuded epithelium with tonometer probe / <strong>70</strong>: subjective refraction within +0.25D and -0.50 D sphere; uses pinhole acuity appropriately; alternating cover test measurement within 4<sup>∆</sup>; chooses correct positions of gaze to work up a vertical deviation; described the C/D ratio within .2; able to identify cataract type and depth / <strong>100</strong>: independently knows when and how to perform a trial frame refraction; able to independently determine a high add on a patient with low vision; able to detect studentuclear ophthalmoplegia; able to independently work up a sudden onset strabismus; found retinal lesion using scleral indentation; retinal lesions documented properly with photography</li><li><strong>diagnosis/management - 40</strong>: failure to dilate patient with flashes and floaters; failure to refer diabetic macular edema and hemorrhage / <strong>70</strong>: able to identify a paretic muscle with Parks 3 step test; able to diagnose early macular degeneration / <strong>100</strong>: diagnosed iritis and appropriately identified systemic concerns; able to manage a LR paresis with Fresnel prism independently</li><li><strong>record keeping  - 40</strong>: no chief complaint recorded; problem/plan list not recorded / <strong>70</strong>: all tests recorded accurately; follow up and recall appointments recorded accurately/ <strong>100</strong>: complex letter/report written independently; complex case record completed accurately and independently</li><li><strong>efficiency - 40</strong>: routine examination not completed in the allotted time; patient records not completed at the end of the day / <strong>70</strong>: completed full routine examination and record within the allotted time; letters completed by the end of the day / <strong>100</strong>: able to complete a complex examination and the record by the end of the scheduled appointment; referral letter written within the half day</li></ul><p><strong>Student Patient Log/ Final Summary:</strong></p><p>Students are required to maintain a comprehensive log and final summary of all patient encounters and enter them on ESES weekly throughout the term. Keeping a complete and accurate summary of all patient care activity on a weekly (preferably daily) basis, is a mandatory course requirement for OPTOM 468. Patient logs will be checked weekly, and random checks will occur throughout the term for accuracy.  In the case where patient logs are found to be inaccurate, the student will be contacted, and the Associate Director for Clinical Education will be notified. </p><p><strong>Student Site Evaluations:</strong></p><p>Students are required to complete a site evaluation on ESES no later than 2 business days after completing OPTOM 468.  Failure to submit a final site evaluation will result in a NCR for Optometry 468. </p><p><strong>Expectations for Students:</strong></p><p>Students are expected to dress appropriately and to always act in a professional manner. All students are required to conform to the professional dress code determined by the individual clerkship facility. Failure to comply with this code may result in the student being excused to modify her/his dress. If the site has no established dress code, the student will be expected to comply with the dress code of the University of Waterloo Optometry Clinic.</p><p>Students should consider themselves to be representatives of UWOVS, as well as of the profession of Optometry, and should behave accordingly. To avoid any potential for misunderstanding the student role at a clerkship site, students are required to wear name badges that clearly identify them as an “Clinical Intern”. Students should be willing to accept responsibility for patients assigned to them, and they should act courteously and responsibly.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>ABSENCES:</strong></p><p>Student attendance in considered mandatory for all clinical assignments and is a requirement even if there are no pre-booked appointments. This course follows the principles outlined in the undergraduate optometry students <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/current-students/optometry-student-resources">Attendance Policy</a>. </p><p><strong>Student Attendance:</strong></p><p>Attendance is mandatory at all activities associated with the site to which they are assigned. The hours and days of office and patient care activity are determined at the discretion of the clerkship supervisor.  </p><p>Students should report to their clerkship supervisor at the beginning of each clinic day. Any student reporting later than 30 minutes after the start of a clinic day will be considered unexcused and will be required to submit an <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/sites/ca.optometry-vision-science/files/uploads/files/absence-request-clinic-externship.pdf">Absence Request Form</a>.  </p><p>Habitual tardiness or unexcused absences is considered inappropriate clinical behaviour and will be graded accordingly. </p><p><strong>Student Authorized, Anticipated Absences from Assigned Clerkship Clinic:</strong></p><p>Students should assume their obligation to the clinical program and to patients is paramount, and that permission to be absent from clerkship rotations will be given only when clearly appropriate. Absences from the clerkship rotation may be approved and endorsed, such that no make-up time is required.  </p><p>Students are allowed a maximum of 3 clinic days of planned and endorsed absence from their clerkship site (including travel*) without make-up time. If a student exceeds 3 days of endorsed absences, make-up time will be automatically required. Alternatively, an absence may also be approved but not endorsed, such that make-up time is required.</p><p><i>*Travel days are only endorsed when the clerkship site is located at least120km from the event location. </i></p><p>Examples of planned absences that are approved and endorsed  (supporting documentation required):</p><ul><li>Academic conferences for:<ul><li>Research presentations (first author only*)<ul><li>Copy of abstract acceptance or invitation to present is required<ul><li><i>*If the student is not the first author of a research presentation, then a letter from the research supervisor and/or first author must explain why the student is being asked to present. </i></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Student certification<ul><li>Proof of student certification application and completion required</li></ul></li><li>Leadership<ul><li>Poof of relevant student leadership position and their role/activities at the conference required</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Optometry related certification examinations (letter from examining board):<ul><li>Optometry Examining Board of Canada (OEBC)</li><li>Jurisprudence examination for any province</li><li>National Board Examiners in Optometry (NBEO)</li></ul></li></ul><p>In addition to the guidelines listed above, planned absences may not be approved during the orientation week of clinic, or during the final week of the rotation to ensure completion of all patient care activities.  </p><p>In cases of bereavement or chronic illness (with doctors note), a student may be entitled to exceed the 3 day maximum. In these instances, cases will be dealt with on an individual basis.</p><p>Examples of planned absences that are approved and not endorsed (supporting documentation required):  </p><ul><li>Alcon Academy for Optometry students (confirmation of registration)</li><li>Any Optometric meeting as an attendee, not as a presenter, volunteer etc. (confirmation of registration)</li><li>Residency interviews (letter from institution)</li><li>School committee membership (committee and role)</li><li>Family emergency, funeral or memorial service (relationship)</li><li>Health care appointment (note from health care provider, information on medical condition is not required)</li><li>UW-recognized religious observance (specific observance, including date(s)/time)</li><li>Major personal celebration event (event, participation, role, and travel days)</li><li>Organized athletic event or other competition (invited participation; correspondence of invitation)</li></ul><p><strong>Unplanned Absences:  </strong></p><p>An absence or lateness may arise due to unforeseen and often emergent circumstances. In such cases, UWOVS recognizes the right of students to determine the best course of action based on their unique knowledge of, and perspective on, the situation. This course of action may include a decision to miss an assigned clinic. Students are expected to immediately notify the clerkship site to which they are assigned if this occurs. UWOVS is committed to fostering a supportive, compassionate environment at the heart of which is the conviction that student well-being is intimately connected to student success.  </p><p>Nevertheless, it must be recognized that a student’s right to decide to miss clinic is accompanied by a responsibility to accept and address any academic consequences of the decision. Students who decide to be absent from clinic are still responsible for submitting notification of their absence as soon as possible, after attending to the immediate needs arising from the situation. Upon return, an <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/sites/ca.optometry-vision-science/files/uploads/files/absence-request-clinic-externship.pdf">Absence Request Form </a>MUST be completed and signed by the clerkship supervisor. The form is then to be emailed to the Clerkship Coordinator.  </p><p>Absences are considered “unauthorized” whenever a student has not notified the clerkship site or the UWOVS, and is found to be absent from an assigned location or activity. Leaving a site, center, or clinic without permission constitutes an “unauthorized absence”. Unauthorized absences is considered inappropriate clinical behaviour and will be graded accordingly. Make-up protocols may be developed at the discretion of the Course Instructor.</p><p><strong>Absence Request Form:</strong></p><p>An <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/sites/ca.optometry-vision-science/files/uploads/files/absence-request-clinic-externship.pdf">Absence Request Form</a> must be completed and submitted for both planned and unplanned absences. If the absence request is for a planned absence, it must be submitted at least 4 weeks in advance of any mandatory activity or as soon as the special circumstance is known. If the absence is unplanned (due to emergent situation, illness etc.), the absence must be reported no later than one week after the first day of absence. The site supervisor must initially authorize the absence before submitting the form and the clerkship head will determine the amount of make-up time required. All absence request forms must be submitted to the Clerkship Coordinator.</p><p>Students should anticipate that each approved absence is generally contingent upon making up that time at a later date within the same clinical rotation. If the absence is unable to be made up during the clerkship, the absence will carry-forward, and the student will be required to make-up that time at the UWOVS Optometry Clinics prior to completing their fourth year. Students may not make-up clinic time prior to the absence date.</p><p><strong>Clerkship Supervisor Absences:</strong></p><p>Clerkship supervisors have been instructed to provide alternate clinic activities if direct patient care cannot be provided due to a planned or unplanned absence. In cases when alternate activities have not been arranged, students are required to inform the Course Instructor and Clerkship Coordinator as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Other Clerkship Absences:</strong></p><p>All absences and absence requests not specifically addressed above will require expressed permission from the clerkship supervisor and the course instructor.</p><p><strong>Unforeseen Clerkship Site Closure:</strong></p><p>If for any reason the clerkship site is not able to continue supervision for the term, the Course Instructor and Clerkship Coordinator will attempt to arrange for immediate placement at an alternate site and time missed will be re-scheduled accordingly.</p><p> </p><p><strong>PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT OF STUDENTS:</strong></p><p>UW Doctor of Optometry Program Mission: <i>“to graduate competent, ethical Doctors of Optometry by providing them with a comprehensive and contemporary optometric education”</i></p><p>Consistent with this mission, the UW Doctor of Optometry program has identified goals for the program. One such goal is to “provide high quality optometric education which will prepare graduates to provide independent contemporary optometric services in an ethical and professional manner”.

  University Policy

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
