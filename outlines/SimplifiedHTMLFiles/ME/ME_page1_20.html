<p><strong>Course Overview: </strong><i>Engineering thermodynamics</i> is the study of the transfer, storage, and conversion of energy—processes that occur in every engineered system. The course will include study of key applications of engineering thermodynamics, including converting heat to work, transfer of thermal energy from lower to higher temperature, processes involving simple chemical reactions, and air-conditioning processes (psychrometrics). The analysis techniques to be studied might be applied in addressing the following questions: How might the performance of a device/system/process be improved? What are the limits on the energy efficiency of a device/system/process? Which components of a system offer the greatest potential for improvement?</p><p><strong>Recommended Preparation: </strong>Prior completion of ME250 is the usual prerequisite. Students should have some knowledge of basic concepts in energy and entropy analysis, and evaluation of thermodynamic property changes (of simple substances) due to a process.</p>

<p><strong>Grading Scheme:</strong> Your course grade will be calculated using whichever scheme results in the higher grade (but potentially modified as mentioned below).</p><p>*  If your grade on the Final Exam is less than 50% the overall grade calculation will be modified as follows: the weight of the lab will be changed to zero and its weight will be shifted to the Final Exam. (Note that this will not be applied if it would result in a higher overall grade than if it were not applied.)</p><p>   </p><p><strong>Refrigeration Lab: </strong>In late January, groups of 2-4 students will perform a lab. Students must complete safety training prior to attending their session. A portion of your individual lab grade will be based on your participation at the session. A brief lab report will be submitted by each group, due approximately two weeks after the lab session. Additional details will be provided separately.</p><p><strong>Midterm Exam: </strong>A 2.0 hour midterm exam will be held at a date and time set by the department (tentatively Feb 24, 11:30 am). Aids permitted will include a “crib sheet” (8.5x11 paper, two sides total), calculator, ruler, and “Property Tables Booklet”. Additional details will be provided separately.</p><p><strong>Final Exam: </strong>A 2.5 hour final exam will be held at a date and time set by the department or registrar. Aids permitted will include a “crib sheet” (8.5x11 paper, four sides total), calculator, ruler, and “Property Tables Booklet”. Additional details will be provided separately.</p><p>   </p><p><strong>Regarding Self-Declared Absences:</strong> The University provides instructors with discretion to determine appropriate accommodations for cases of student absences in their courses. Where a student misses a test (e.g. quiz, exam) due to a self-declared absence, appropriate accommodation could include administration of a make-up test (written, oral, or hybrid).</p><p><strong>Late Submissions:</strong> Unless otherwise specified, late submissions for graded projects will be accepted to a maximum of 72 hours late. Late submissions will receive an immediate penalty of 10% and the penalty will increase by 10% for each additional 24 hours. Extensions may be granted in certain circumstances. Requests for extensions should be made before the due date. (Projects assessed as CR/NCR will not be accepted late except where an extension has been granted.)</p><p><strong>AI Text Generation Tools: </strong>The assessments in this course include submission of a lab report. Part of the intent of this work is to provide you with an opportunity to develop your abilities to communicate clearly and effectively. Therefore, it is recommended that you <u>avoid</u> using AI text generation tools in preparing your submission.

<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous"><u>Office of Indigenous Relations</u></a><u>.</u> </p><p><strong>Religious &amp; Spiritual Observances: </strong>The University of Waterloo has a duty to accommodate religious and spiritual observances under the Ontario Human Rights Code. Please inform the instructor at the beginning of term if special accommodation needs to be made for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and assignments. Consult with your instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought. </p><p><strong>Lecture Environment: </strong>Attendees at lectures and tutorials are expected to contribute to an environment that is conducive to teaching, learning, and wellness. As much as possible, the environment should be kept free of unnecessary distractions. Attendees should feel free to advise the instructor/presenter of issues occurring within the learning environment that are creating unreasonable distractions or interfering with their ability to participate.</p><p><strong>Arrival at Lectures:</strong> Please arrive early enough to be ready to participate at the intended lecture start time.</p><p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> All members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to adhere to principles of academic integrity. Further, members of the engineering profession—and those seeking entry into it—are expected to uphold high standards of personal honour and integrity. Please consider that the personal traits and habits that you develop during your education are carried forward into your career. Those who find ways to justify “taking short-cuts” as they pursue their education may be unintentionally training themselves do the same in their careers. Unfortunately, engineers who have “taken short-cuts” have been responsible for many disasters and failures. Ask the instructor if you have any questions or concerns. Check the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.</p><p><strong>Flexible Grading Scheme:</strong> In cases of an academic integrity violation, the grading scheme may be adjusted at the instructor’s discretion such that use of a flexible scheme does not provide a "loop-hole" that would allow a student to avoid the consequences of the violation.</p><p><strong>Acceptable Use of Course Materials:  </strong>Materials provided to students in any format (including, but not limited to: electronic and hard-copy documents, video recordings, etc.) are provided solely for their <u>personal use</u> in completing the coursework. Students are not permitted to share or distribute course materials by any means (including, but not limited to: uploading to a 3<sup>rd</sup> party website, emailing, etc.), unless prior written permission is provided by the instructor. Unauthorized distribution of any material will be considered an academic offense and may constitute copyright infringement. (Note: As clarification to the above, it is acceptable for students enrolled in the course to share material with other students enrolled in the course, <u>while</u> they are both enrolled.)</p><p><strong>Confidentiality of Tests:</strong> The content of all tests (including quizzes and exams) used in this course is confidential. It is a violation of academic integrity to convey and/or transmit content from any test to another person by any means. Further, it is a violation of academic integrity to record, copy, photograph, or store images or descriptions of the content of tests, for any purpose.</p><p><strong>Public Health Considerations:</strong> If necessitated by public health conditions, some aspects of the course (including administration of assessments) may be adjusted. As much as possible, any needed changes will be implemented with intent to avoid imposing unreasonable hardship on any stakeholder (including students, teaching team, administration) based on the discretion of the instructor.</p><p><strong>Declaring absences:</strong> Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, students are responsible for reaching out to their instructors as soon as possible. The course instructor will determine how missed course components are accommodated. </p><p><strong>Rescheduling Co-op Interviews: </strong>Follow the co-op process for rescheduling co-op interviews for conflicts to graded assignments (e.g. midterms, tests, and final exams). Attendance at co-operative work-term employment interviews is not considered to be a valid reason to miss a test.</p>
