<p><strong>Course Overview:</strong> Achieving significant reductions in building energy consumption will be important in efforts to deal with the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of energy use. The energy used by heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems represents a large portion of the energy consumption of most commercial, institutional, and residential buildings. This course will introduce selected topics in HVAC systems design, with focus on energy-efficiency and environmental-sustainability: heating and cooling distribution using air-, water-, and refrigerant-based systems; constant- and variable-flow systems; heat- and energy-recovery systems; vapor-compression heat-pump systems, including air- and geothermal-source heat pumps.</p><p><strong>Recommended Preparation:</strong> It is strongly recommended that students have engaged in prior study of introductory concepts in thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics, including analysis of refrigeration cycles and basic psychrometrics. Students without this background are expected to undertake additional study to acquire sufficient competency in each topic. </p>

Consult with your instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought. </p><p><strong>Lecture Environment: </strong>Attendees at lectures and tutorials are expected to contribute to an environment that is conducive to teaching, learning, and wellness. As much as possible, the environment should be kept free of unnecessary distractions. Attendees should feel free to advise the instructor/presenter of issues occurring within the learning environment that are creating unreasonable distractions or interfering with their ability to participate.</p><p><strong>Arrival at Lectures:</strong> Please arrive early enough to be ready to participate at the intended lecture start time.</p><p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> All members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to adhere to principles of academic integrity. Further, members of the engineering profession—and those seeking entry into it—are expected to uphold high standards of personal honour and integrity. Please consider that the personal traits and habits that you develop during your education are carried forward into your career. Those who find ways to justify “taking short-cuts” as they pursue their education may be unintentionally training themselves do the same in their careers. Unfortunately, engineers who have “taken short-cuts” have been responsible for many disasters and failures. Ask the instructor if you have any questions or concerns. Check the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.</p><p><strong>Flexible Grading Scheme:</strong> In cases of an academic integrity violation, the grading scheme may be adjusted at the instructor’s discretion such that use of a flexible scheme does not provide a "loop-hole" that would allow a student to avoid the consequences of the violation.</p><p><strong>Acceptable Use of Course Materials:  </strong>Materials provided to students in any format (including, but not limited to: electronic and hard-copy documents, video recordings, etc.) are provided solely for their <u>personal use</u> in completing the coursework. Students are not permitted to share or distribute course materials by any means (including, but not limited to: uploading to a 3<sup>rd</sup> party website, emailing, etc.), unless prior written permission is provided by the instructor. Unauthorized distribution of any material will be considered an academic offense and may constitute copyright infringement. (Note: As clarification to the above, it is acceptable for students enrolled in the course to share material with other students enrolled in the course, <u>while</u> they are both enrolled.)</p><p><strong>Confidentiality of Tests:</strong> The content of all tests (including quizzes and exams) used in this course is confidential. It is a violation of academic integrity to convey and/or transmit content from any test to another person by any means. Further, it is a violation of academic integrity to record, copy, photograph, or store images or descriptions of the content of tests, for any purpose.</p><p><strong>Public Health Considerations:</strong> If necessitated by public health conditions, some aspects of the course (including administration of assessments) may be adjusted. As much as possible, any needed changes will be implemented with intent to avoid imposing unreasonable hardship on any stakeholder (including students, teaching team, administration) based on the discretion of the instructor.</p><p><strong>Declaring absences:</strong> Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, students are responsible for reaching out to their instructors as soon as possible. The course instructor will determine how missed course components are accommodated. </p><p><strong>Rescheduling Co-op Interviews: </strong>Follow the co-op process for rescheduling co-op interviews for conflicts to graded assignments (e.g. midterms, tests, and final exams). Attendance at co-operative work-term employment interviews is not considered to be a valid reason to miss a test.</p>
