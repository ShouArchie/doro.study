  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ME 533:</div>
<p>This course is intended to provide an advanced treatment of the structure, properties, and processing of non-metallic and composite materials based on polymers, metals, and ceramics. The structure and properties of polymers and ceramics in bulk form and as matrices and reinforcements in composites will be covered. Processing methods for non-metallics and composites (example extrusion, injection molding, etc.) will be considered. The geometrical arrangement of fibres within laminae and their influences on elastic and strength properties of composites will be described based on suitable micromechanical models. The role of the matrix and fibre/matrix interface in determining composite properties will be described.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>This course is intended to be an extension of the materials science and engineering series of courses (i.e. ME115, ME230, ME340) in the ME program. The ultimate aim of the course is to take an in-depth look at composite materials, their properties, how to tailor their properties, and how to manufacture them. To do this, one must understand some basic ideas regarding the components that makes up the composite itself. The case of metal has been discussed thoroughly in ME115, and ME230, so this course will focus on the non-metallic materials, that is on polymers and on ceramics. </p>

<p><strong>A Note on Assessments </strong></p><p>This course will consist of numerical and conceptual assessments. These assessments will be administered online and students will be given some period of time (usually a week or so) to complete the task. </p><p>Numerical assessments are planned to be assignment-liked. These will likely be conducted on Crowdmark. </p><p>Numerical Assessment #1 is planned to be distributed around week 8 (~Feb 24<sup>th</sup>) and will be due at the end of term. This may be split into two assignments due at different times if the class prefers.</p><p>Conceptual assessments are planned to be Bongo video assignments to emulate a verbal exam on top of a written portion on Crowdmark. It will consist of simply "explain this concept back" to me type questions. The format may be modified a little if the class size is too large to make this feasible. </p><p>Conceptual Assessment #1 is planned to occur 1 week after completing section 3 which is typically around week 5 or 6 (~Feb 3rd or Feb 10<sup>th</sup>).</p><p>Conceptual Assessment #2 is planned to occur 1 week after section 6-3 which is typically around week 10 or 11(~Mar 10<sup>th</sup> or 17<sup>th</sup>)</p><p>During the first week of the final exam period, there will be a final assessment with one or both a numerical and a conceptual assessment. </p><p><strong>Submission(s) for this course:</strong></p><p>There are various submissions for this course, mostly on a group basis. These includes the lab. Reports and the project related submission. <strong>Unless otherwise stated, the due time is at 23:59 of the provided due date. </strong></p><p>Unless otherwise stated, the <strong>late penalty is 10 marks off the total per day</strong> for any late submission(s). The submission time logged on the relevant LEARN dropbox will be used for tallying any late penalties. Submissions will not be accepted after 5 days unless a prior arrangement has been discussed with the instructor.  </p><p>If special circumstances arise, please contact the instructor as soon as you can. Any arrangement should be handled ahead of the deadline rather than after the deadline. </p>

<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
