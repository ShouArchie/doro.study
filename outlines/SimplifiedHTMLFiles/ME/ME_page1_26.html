  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ME 380:</div>
<p>In this course, students study the design process, including needs analysis, problem definition; design criteria and critical parameter identification, generation of alternative solutions; conceptual design, detailed design, optimization; and implementation. Most of the term is devoted to a significant design project in which student groups work independently and competitively, applying the design process to a project goal set by the faculty co-ordinator. The design project typically includes construction of a prototype, and part of the course grade may depend on the performance of the prototype in a competitive test. In exceptional circumstances, the requirement for a prototype may be replaced by a computer simulation, or may be waived. Other mechanical engineering faculty members, particularly those teaching 3B courses, are available to provide advice and supervision to ME380 students.</p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Course Communication:</h4><p><u>Lectures &amp; Project Time (Fridays 1:30-4:30 pm):</u> There will be live lectures for the first two weeks of the term in E5 3101. The following weeks of the term the ME380 course time in your schedule will be directed towards project-related design activities &amp; deliverables. Weekly meetings with the Instructional team will be scheduled during the Project Time in DWE 2524.</p><p><u>Learn</u> will be used for all official course communication, including posting of course materials, documentation for deliverables, and for submission of course deliverables.</p><p>A <u>Microsoft Teams</u> page has been created for the course (<strong>ME 380 -Winter 2025</strong>). This page will not be used for class activities and meetings. Instead, the page has been created for the benefit of the student groups to facilitate group work and remote meetings when they required. Each group will have their own private “channel” (<strong>Group XX</strong>) that will only be viewable by the group members along with the instructional team members. This channel will enable each group to use the suite of tools within Microsoft Teams to conduct their project management this term including chat functionality, record meetings, SharePoint pages, OneNote notebooks, and Task Planner. Use of these tools is encouraged by the instructional team. Note: All communication on the ME380 Teams pages must remain professional since it will be viewable by the instructional team.</p><p> </p><h4>Team Formation and Student Responsibilities:</h4><p><strong>Team Formation:</strong> Students will work in groups of 4 students to complete all requirements of the course. Students are free to pick their teammates; however, the instructional team can assist as needed. Once formed, all team members must be added to a Group # in Learn. Teams need to self-enroll to Learn as soon as possible; all ME380 students must be in a group by <strong>Tuesday January 14th</strong> at the latest.</p><p><strong>Student Responsibilities:</strong> All group members are expected to participate in all aspects of the project, including needs analysis, conceptual design, prototyping, testing, and communication. Most deliverables will have a common grade awarded to all group members, but the Design Portfolio will be submitted individually. The teamwork grade for individuals will be based on the results from two peer evaluations during weeks 6 and 13, as well as an evaluation by the Instructional Team based of the Weekly Meeting contributions. Note that in the event a team member is assessed poorly by their peers in both evaluations (i.e., an extreme case), the instructor may deduct additional marks from the individual pending a one-on-one meeting with the individual.  </p><p><strong>Team Charter: </strong>Teams will be required to complete a charter document (template posted to Learn) that details the expectations for the group members throughout the term. This should include clearly defined team roles, expected contributions, meeting schedules, project management hierarchy, and dispute resolution strategies. All team members must sign the document and submit it to the Learn Dropbox by <strong>Friday January 17th</strong>. It is up to the group members to agree upon the structure and communicate to the instructional team that they will each be responsible for performing their designated roles and be accountable for their actions.</p><p> </p><h4>Design Logs and Weekly Meetings:</h4><p><strong>Design Logs</strong>: Groups will be required to submit three brief design logs at defined points throughout the term detailing the group’s design activities and project management. Each design log is submitted as a group (not individually). The purpose of the design logs is to track and assess progress of the design work completed by the group members throughout the term and receive feedback and guidance from the instructional team.  </p><p>The content of design logs should reflect evidence of the on-going design work using the Engineering Design Process. In evaluating the group’s capacity to reach their design goals, the design logs must provide project management updates related to the questions below (use of tables or charts is encouraged):</p><p>1. What individual or group project related tasks or activities did each team member do? How long did you spend on each activity? Is the activity on schedule and when will it be completed by?</p><p>2. Is the project on budget? Are resources being sourced and used appropriately?  </p><p>3. Are short and long-term project risks being considered? Have mitigation strategies been identified?</p><p>Design logs should be a concise summary over ~2-5 pages; use of descriptive bullet points, photos and figures is highly encouraged. Design logs will be evaluated based on project management and evidenced of design progress. The course grade component (15%) will be equally split over the three design logs; failed design logs will receive a grade of 0.  </p><p>Design logs must be submitted to Learn by the deadline (see Schedule).  </p><p><strong>Weekly Meetings: </strong>Starting in Week 2, groups are required to meet with their assigned TA to provide and receive project feedback. Meetings will be scheduled in 10-minute blocks on Fridays between 2:30-4:30pm. Attendance at the weekly meeting is required for all group members each week (as part of the teamwork evaluation). You can miss up to one meeting without penalty (applied individually against the teamwork grade). Previous feedback on the weekly meetings has been very positive.</p><h4>Course Deliverables: </h4><p>There are four major deliverables in this course:  </p><p>(1) Project Proposal Presentation (15%)</p><p>(2) Construction Check Presentation (20%)</p><p>(3) Design Verification Presentation (25%)</p><p>(4) Individual Design Portfolio (15%)</p><p>The presentations will be scheduled in-person. Additional documentation on these deliverables will be provided in the respective documents on Learn.</p><p>As a project-based course, acknowledging any external help, assistance, and materials received on your project is a requirement. Acknowledgement is typically stated in a separate section and/or referenced with a citation. To acknowledge individual and team contributions, all presentations must contain the following statement:</p><p>“We are the sole authors of this presentation and, unless otherwise stated and properly referenced, the entire content of this presentation is our original work. We have all contributed to the presentation and are aware of the content. The content of this presentation has not received credit in any other course that we have taken in the past or are currently taking at this time.”</p><p><strong><u>Individual Design Portfolio: </u></strong>As part of the culmination of the design project, each group member will be required to submit a 3 page design portfolio summarizing their main contributions to the project. The portfolio should provide a visual summary that contextualizes the contributions and technical details of their work. Each design portfolio must be signed by another group member as confirmation of the described contributions. </p><p> </p><h4><strong>Schedule Details:</strong></h4><p>The majority of the allocated course time in this design workshop course is to be used towards project design, testing and analysis as a team. Course activities and deliverables scheduled this term are detailed below. </p><p> </p><p><strong><u>NOTE: All times listed are in EST</u></strong></p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><p> </p></td><td><p><strong>Week  </strong></p></td><td><strong>Course Activities</strong></td><td><strong>Deliverables (NG = Not graded)</strong></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6"><p><strong>PHASE 1</strong></p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p><i><strong>Lecture 1:</strong></i> Course Introduction &amp; Needs Analysis</p><ul><li>Friday Jan 10<sup>th</sup> 1:30-2:20pm </li></ul><p><i><strong>Lecture 2:</strong></i> Eng.

You can suggest alternate design objectives for approval by the instructional team. Design objectives should be verified or demonstrated at the end of the term in addition to the project criteria/constraints listed above.</p><p><i><u>Possible Design Objectives:</u></i></p><ol><li>Design for speed to move 2+ objects </li><li>Design for accuracy/precision of object placement or storage in drop-off area</li><li>Design for strength-weight ratio to lift and move heavier objects</li><li>Design for efficiency to minimize the amount of energy or work required </li><li>Design for range of motion to pick up objects from multiple storage areas</li><li>Design for dexterity to place objects on the conveyor in different orientations </li><li>Design for compliance to pick up difficult to grasp objects (beyond the baseline 3DBenchy)</li><li>Design for smooth operation (e.g. minimize jerkiness)</li><li>Design for adaptability to handle variable storage area conditions (e.g. mixed objects)</li></ol><p> </p><p><i><strong>Project Scope:</strong> </i>The individual design criterion and demonstration methods for the selected design objective are intended to be open-ended and up to the team to propose to the “client” (instructor and TAs). Teams are encouraged to draw inspiration from existing ideas/examples, as the idea does <u>not</u> have to be entirely original. All ideas should be properly referenced with specific rationale why a new design or advancement is needed and how the designed improvement adds value. Team projects will be guided and advised by the instructional team to assist with defining a suitable project scope. In general, the overall structure of the project should follow:</p><ul><li>Identify the design need, define design requirements, and develop design specifications</li><li>Generate and assess design concepts</li><li>Embodiment and detailed design</li><li>Verify that the design meets the requirements</li></ul><p> </p><p><i><strong>Component Kit Sign-Out:</strong></i></p><p>During Weeks 1 and 2, teams can sign-out a component kit from Paul Groh (DWE-2524). The kit contains several key components that were ordered in bulk for the course. Other construction materials are to be procured as needed (see below).</p><p>Please bring a filled-out and signed copy of the “Kit Sign-out Agreement.docx” file, which is available on Learn. You will NOT receive a kit unless this is signed by everyone in your group.</p><p><i><strong>Kit Components:</strong></i></p><p>Care and attention to detail are required when assembling, modifying and testing your platform design; components are easily damaged and the <u>cost for replacement parts will be paid for by the group</u>. Some of these components have been used in previous course offerings – <strong>make sure to test your components to verify they are working as required. </strong>The no-charge component kit swap out (to replace any damaged components) deadline is <strong>Friday January 24<sup>th</sup></strong><sup> </sup><strong>at 4:00pm</strong> to Paul Groh in DWE-2524. Use of the kit components is optional; unwanted or unneeded kit components can be returned to Paul Groh at the end of the term.</p><p>Here is a list of the kit components and their cost:</p><ul><li>(1 per kit) Arduino Mega: <strong>$60.00 </strong>each</li><li>(6 per kit) Tower Pro MG995 servomotor: <strong>$12.00 </strong>each</li><li>(1 per kit) Container: <strong>$6.00 </strong>each</li><li>(1 per kit) USB cable:<strong>$5.00 </strong>each</li><li>1 package of servo horns</li><li>8 jumper wires: <strong>$1</strong> total</li><li>(2 per kit) smraza S51 micro servomotor: <strong>$8.00 </strong>each</li></ul><p><i><strong>Procurement:</strong></i></p><p>Building the powered mechanisms will require procurement of additional components and materials. ME380 project expenses up to a <strong><u>maximum of $215/team</u> </strong>will be supported by the MME department. <strong>To use these department funds, you must submit a purchase request to either WatiMake or Paul Groh (p3groh@uwaterloo.ca)</strong>. Purchases can be made for WatIMake facilities or materials/components from Digikey, Amazon or McMaster Carr.  <u>We will not be reimbursing out-of-pocket expenses this term for any purchases made with Ridgidware, or other off-campus vendors (e.g., Home Depot).</u></p><p>Based on previous experience from this course, we suggest the following order for seeking procurement:</p><ol><li><strong>MESS System. </strong>It is highly recommended that you use the MESS system (<a href="https://uwaterloo.snipe-it.io/login">https://uwaterloo.snipe-it.io/login</a>) as your first option when looking for components for your project. For details on how to effectively utilize this system please see the WATiMake training module on LEARN. If you are not already enrolled please self-register into "WATiMake Orientation &amp; Training" course. For more details on self-registration please see: https://uwaterloo.ca/learn-help/instructors/self-registration-courses</li><li><strong>WatIMake. </strong>One of the resources that you have for your ME 380 projects are the 3D printers and laser cutters at WATiMake. Once you have completed your training on these machines you can print and laser cut your projects yourselves. When your print or laser cutting jobs are done, simply let the WATiMake co-op students know that you are in ME 380, along with your group number and the final cost of your job. The students will then add this to your account total. If you exceed your total budget, then you will be responsible for paying for the material yourself using your WatCard.</li><li><strong>Digikey / McMaster Carr / Amazon. </strong>Items from these vendors can be purchased by submitting a purchase request to Paul Groh.
