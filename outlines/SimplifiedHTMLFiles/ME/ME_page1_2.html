<p role="note">The ME 101 programming textbooks are optional. They are recommended for beginner programmers who like to learn by reading a textbook (e.g. to prepare for lectures, or to review course concepts). Other C++ books and MATLAB books, or earlier editions of the textbook are also suitable for those students. Links to online references and tutorials for C++ will be posted to the ME 101 Learn website, along with practice problems, so most students opt to use the resources provided rather than purchasing the textbook.</p>

<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>If your programming final exam grade is less than 40%, then your overall course grade will be your final exam grade.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Failure to return or to pay for damage or missing robot kits or Tetrix kit parts will result in a grade of FTC (failure to complete) for all group members.</p><h3>Mechanical Design</h3><p><strong>Grades </strong>– The programming and the mechanical engineering design parts of the course have equal weighting, each contributing to half of the overall grade. The grade for the mechanical engineering part of the course will be based on weekly assignments, two term tests, and a final design project that includes a demonstration, written report and teamwork assessment, using the following weighting scheme. The late penalty for any submitted work (other than the Term Tests) is 20% per working day. </p><p><strong>Group Work</strong> – All assessments for ME101 Mechanical Engineering Design will be group-based, except for Assignment #1a and the Term Tests. One submission will be made by the project group for all other deliverables: assignments, design reviews, project demonstration and project report. All group members will receive the same mark for each graded item. </p><p>The course instructor reserves the right to require all group members to submit work individually for any assignment or project deliverable.  This would be done in cases where the course instructor believes that work is not being evenly distributed among the group, based on information from the following. </p><ul><li>Teamwork surveys, held twice during the term</li><li>Concerns arising from design review meetings</li><li>Personal communication from individual group members</li></ul><p>Groups are strongly encouraged to address teamwork early and often throughout the term, as follows. </p><ul><li>Have a clear understanding of the time each person is willing to invest in the course per week</li><li>Identify times when the group can meet to work together and agree to meeting at these times. Inperson meetings are strongly encouraged over online meetings, text messages, chat, etc.</li><li>Review and update expectations regularly to account for changes in workload or other personal factors.</li><li>Agree on the approach to take when conflicts arise or team members don’t meet deadlines, skip meetings, etc. If you are unable to resolve these issues, ask the course instructor for help.</li></ul><p><strong>Term Tests – </strong>Two tests will be held during the term outside of the normally scheduled midterm and final exam periods. You are expected to write the term tests as scheduled unless you have contacted the instructor beforehand. Failure to write a test without sufficient reason (e.g. severe illness, schedule conflict) will result in a grade of zero. The term tests are closed book with no reference page or calculator allowed. </p><p><strong>Assignments - </strong>There will be weekly assignments for the mechanical engineering design part of the course throughout the term. Each of these assignments will provide you an opportunity to work on a portion of what will become your final design project report, such as needs analysis, design concepts, project plan, etc. </p><p><strong>Design Reviews –</strong> Two design reviews will be held during the term, where groups will present progress on their design project. Design reviews will be graded based on preparation for the meeting, effectiveness of presentation, and response to feedback and questions. Each design review will have a weighting equivalent to a weekly assignment. </p><p><strong>Mechanical Engineering Design Days </strong>– During Week 2 all project groups will participate in Mechanical Engineering Design Days (Mech Days), experiencing an open-ended design challenge in a team based, collaborative environment with limited time and material resources. There will be a reflection assignment that is completed by each group following Mech Days, with a weighting equivalent to one weekly assignment. </p><p><strong>“Picture a Scientist” screening </strong>– On Thursday, March 27 the documentary film “Picture a Scientist” will be shown, followed by a review activity. Attendance is optional but strongly encouraged. A bonus of 0.5% will be added to the final course grade for anyone who actively participates in this activity. </p><p><strong>Project - </strong>The project is to be completed in groups of 4 students of your choosing. The project encompasses both programming and mechanical engineering design, and will be implemented using the Lego EV3 robots, extra parts, and Tetrix kits signed out from First Year Engineering, and parts that you design and build.  Any additional electronic parts, beyond the ones signed out, need to be approved by the course instructors.  <strong>The late penalty is 20% per working day on a given task.</strong> An outline of the major tasks and deliverables is as follows:</p><p> </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Needs analysis, case study (Assignment #1a)        </td><td>Monday, January 13, 10:00pm </td></tr><tr><td>Project Topic Selection                                              </td><td>Tuesday, January 14, 10:00pm </td></tr><tr><td>Needs analysis, project topic (Assignment #1b) </td><td>Monday, January 20, 10:00pm </td></tr><tr><td>Conceptual design, project topic (Assignment #2) </td><td>Monday, January 27, 10:00pm </td></tr><tr><td>Sensors (Assignment #3)                                           </td><td>Monday, February 3, 10:00pm</td></tr><tr><td>Design review #1                                                        </td><td>Thursday, February 6, 1:30-4:30pm</td></tr><tr><td>Project plan (Assignment #4)                                   </td><td>Monday, February 10, 10:00pm </td></tr><tr><td>Design review #2   </td><td>Thursday, March 6, 1:30-4:30pm </td></tr><tr><td>Functional analysis (Assignment #5)                                              </td><td>Friday, March 14, 10:00pm</td></tr><tr><td>Design project demonstration                                 </td><td>Tuesday, April 1, 8:30am-Noon</td></tr><tr><td>Final report                                                                 </td><td>Friday, April 4, 10:00pm</td></tr><tr><td>Teamwork peer and self-assessment                      </td><td>Friday, April 4, 10:00pm<strong> </strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong> </strong></p><h3>Programming</h3><h4>Assignments</h4><p>There will be weekly programming assignments given during most weeks of the term, that will involve coding, and some will involve a LEARN quiz of short answer questions. Most weeks the coding will be completed in pairs. Students will be matched in pairs at random, with a new match occurring each week. The purpose of the weekly assignments is to give you programming practice. Some assignments may also require you to demonstrate your working program to a Tutor/TA. Time to work on the assignments and get help from the teaching team is provided during the programming labs, although for later assignments you will likely need to work on the outside the lab time as well.  Assignments are due:</p><ul><li>Tuesday LAB 202: due on Wednesday at 10:00pm</li><li>Thursday LAB 201: due on Friday at 10:00pm</li></ul><p>The late penalty is 20% per day.</p><p><i><strong>Seek Help, Get an Extension on the Assignment Due Date</strong></i>: For students who have sought extra help on a programming assignment from the teaching team (before or after the due date), the EISTs/Tutors/TAs/instructor will waive the late penalty and grant a 48-hour extension. They will not however, grant the extension if you have not made an effort to work with them to complete the assignment. By seeking help again, a student can earn a second extension. Extensions beyond that time may be granted by the instructor for students who have worked with them to get back on track with regard to the course material. </p><p>Program source code for assignments should be saved and then uploaded to Crowdmark. Each source file should include:</p><ul><li>A comment that acknowledges any help received from any person not on the teaching team, or from any other source including websites, the course textbook, etc.</li><li>Your C++ programs;</li><li>Any output, as described in the assignment, which should be included as a comment at the end of the program file; output must be generated by the code that was submitted</li></ul><p>Files that contain additional information, e.g. a drawing of a flow chart, should be legible – check your upload to Crowdmark to verify this.</p><p>The EISCs/Tutors/TAs may also, at their discretion, initially assign a zero to an assignment or to an assignment question, and then request that you resubmit it for grading.</p><h4>Recorded Lecture Quizzes</h4><p>There are three online quizzes to be completed on Learn during the first three weeks of term:</p><ul><li>Friday Jan 10 at 8:20am</li><li>Friday Jan 17 at 8:20am</li><li>Friday Jan 24 at 8:20am</li></ul><p><strong>Note that each quiz does not appear on Learn until after you have accessed the recorded lecture videos.</strong></p><h4>Robot Project</h4><p>The project will involve programming the Lego EV3 robot to complete a task of your choosing. You will be making significant changes to the robot’s configuration, adding additional components to implement your mechanical design, and then completing a software design, coding the robot, and testing and debugging your system to complete your specified task. The project will be completed in groups of 4 students. The late penalty is 20% per day on any given software task.  Any additional electronic parts, beyond the ones signed out, need to be approved by the course instructors. </p><p>Note: Group members are responsible for the contents of the robot kit that they will sign out for the project and will be billed for missing or broken parts. <u>Failure to return or pay for the robot kit will result in a grade of FTC for all members of the group</u>.</p><p>A detailed project description will be posted to the ME 101 LEARN site.</p><p>The software part of the project will involve:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Design Review #3</strong></p><ul><li>Physical system is built</li><li>Flow charts of software design</li><li>Description of data storage</li><li>Software test plan</li></ul></td><td>Tues Mar 25 9:30am-11:20am and 1:30pm-2:20pm</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Project Demonstration</strong></p><ul><li>Demonstrate your software operation</li></ul></td><td> Tues April 1 8:30am-Noon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Final Project Report</strong></td><td>Fri Apr 4 at 10:00pm</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h4>Exams</h4><p>The midterm and final exams are closed book, with no calculators. You are allowed to bring one reference page to the exams.The reference page:</p><ul><li>8.5 inch by 11 inch; midterm is single-sided, final is double-sided</li><li>Handwritten or typed</li><li>No content restrictions</li></ul><p>You are expected to write the midterm and final exams as scheduled unless you have contacted the instructor before the exam about a schedule conflict.

Absences requiring documentation (e.g., Verification of Illness Form, bereavement, etc.) are to be uploaded by completing the form on the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/"><u>VIF System</u></a>. The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services"><u>UWaterloo Verification of Illness form</u></a>, completed by a health professional, is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not send documentation to your advisor, course instructor, teaching assistant, or lab coordinator. Submission through the VIF System, once approved, will notify your instructors of your absence.</p><p>For group assessments when all students in the group self-declare an absence, or individual assessments when a student self-declares an absence, either the assessment will be deferred or the weight shifted to a similar type of assessment, e.g. a missed assignment will increase the weight of the remaining assignments. Groups where only some members declare an absence should contact the course instructor about whether or not an accommodation for the absence is appropriate.</p><p><strong>Rescheduling Co-op Interviews: </strong>Follow the co-op process for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts"><u>rescheduling co-op interviews</u></a> for conflicts to graded assignments (e.g., midterms, tests, and final exams).

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
