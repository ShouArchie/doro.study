It will be used to set expectations and provide additional information on key aspects of the course. </p><p><strong><u>Design Reviews: </u></strong></p><p>There will be three Design Reviews for this course, Initial (IDR), Midterm (MDR) and Final (FDR). The reviews are intended for students to update the instructional team on their project status and progress and obtain feedback and guidance from the instructional team. These reviews are intended to improve the quality of student learning and the quality of the projects, as well as to monitor and evaluate progress. Each review will have a similar format: a presentation (approximately 20 minutes) followed by or intermingled with discussion. Each presentation should include the following information (also review the paragraph below the bullet list):</p><ul><li>A very brief review of the project background and objectives</li><li>A concise description of the project requirements, constraints, criteria (specifications)</li><li><strong>A concise description of the status of the project at the last review, and a summary of response to feedback received at that review</strong> (the final report in ME481 for the IDR)</li><li>A summary of the status of the project, including a presentation of key design and analysis work completed since the previous review</li><li>A concise plan for work for the remainder of the course</li><li>A current summary of project management data, with an emphasis on milestones and budget(s)</li><li><strong>A time compilation that shows individual member contributions to date.</strong></li></ul><p>Students should use their judgement in deciding what to present and to what level of detail. Most of each design review should be on new material. In each case, students are encouraged to identify issues, make considered proposals as appropriate, and use this opportunity to seek advice from the review committee. <strong>Any changes since the previous review should be highlighted.</strong> </p><p><strong><u>Initial Design Review </u></strong></p><p>The IDR serves as a ‘kick-off’ meeting for the term. Its focus will be on resetting project objectives as required, updating the project plan, and outlining the verification plan. Teams should summarize their project, update the reviewers on the status (changes since their ME481 final report, including response to feedback), and provide a plan for the term (with a focus on verification). Be sure to list specific hazards related to your project, and be prepared to present their updated Hazard Disclosure form.</p><p><strong><u>Safety Review Meeting with MME Technical Staff­</u></strong></p><p>After the Initial Design Review, teams must book a meeting with our technical staff. A sign-up sheet will be available. During this session, your project will undergo a preliminary review of electrical, mechanical, and chemical hazards. All team members must be present. Failure to attend this meeting will result in a 2% grade deduction.</p><p>If significant hazards are identified, subsequent actions and reviews will be required. Qualified staff must review prototypes that have safety concerns prior to testing or operation. </p><p><strong><u>Midterm Design Review </u></strong></p><p>The MDR serves as an update for the project, and focus will be placed on design progress and verification status. For the MDR, teams should summarize their project, apprise the instruction team on the status (changes since the IDR, including response to feedback), and provide a plan for the term. Other students in the class will be invited to provide feedback at this meeting. An external reviewer (usually from industry) will be invited to participate and provide feedback.</p><p><strong><u>Final Design Review </u></strong></p><p>The FDR serves as the final project update and the last opportunity for formal feedback from the instructional team. This is intended to provide a key milestone prior to the Symposium, and to provide feedback on expectations for the final report. For the FDR, teams should summarize their project, update us on the status (changes since their MDR, including response to feedback), and provide a plan for the Symposium and for the rest of the term. </p><p><strong><u>Mechanical Engineering Symposium</u></strong></p><p>The Mechanical Engineering Symposium will take place on <strong>Monday March 24<sup>th</sup></strong> in E5 and E7. Arrangements will be finalized in the coming weeks once group’s space requests are made. During the Symposium, students will be expected to provide a short summary of their project, with emphasis on verification of project objectives. This will be reviewed both by the instructors, their peers and external judges (both technical and non-technical). Groups will have time to respond to questions from external judges (both technical and non-technical), the instructor, and their peers.</p><p><strong><u>Design Project Report</u></strong></p><p>The purpose of the Design Project Report is to <strong>summarize</strong> the entire design project and to provide all data and documentation as appendices.  The <strong>report must not exceed 9000 words</strong><a href="#_ftn1"><strong>[1]</strong></a>, excluding the front matter and Appendices. <strong>Students will be asked to provide the word count for their text in the final report. </strong>Note that all material in the appendices must be referenced in the text. <strong>The report structure is as follows</strong></p><p>Front matter, including, </p><ul><li>Title page<ul><li>Project title </li><li>Team number and students’ names</li><li>Instructional Team (Instructor and Faculty Advisor(s) names)</li><li>Confidentiality provisions as appropriate</li></ul></li><li>Signature page <strong>outlining individual contributions</strong>, with the statement “We the undersigned take responsibility for this design” </li><li>A list of Appendices</li><li>Summary report, including:<ul><li>A <strong>concise summary</strong> of work completed in ME481, including a brief project justification and background, and project specifications. Be sure to only summarize the ME481 proposal and report and reference them. Include the current specifications in an Appendix. Any changes from ME481 should be briefly discussed/justified. <strong>Make sure to include key figures in the main text, and more detailed information in the Appendix.</strong></li><li>Summary of the design work completed this term. Briefly summarize the options considered, design decisions made, and the engineering analyses completed to support these design decisions.

<p>Note that all grades are assigned to teams, but may be adjusted for inequities in contributions, as discussed in the teamwork evaluations below. Grades will be assigned for Design, Project Management, and Communication for all design deliverables: project reviews and the report. </p><p>Course instructor and faculty advisor grades are combined for all course deliverables submitted by students. </p><p><strong><u>Evaluation Adjustments</u></strong></p><p><strong>Instructors</strong> <strong>may adjust grades to account for individual contributions within a team, based primarily on the student peer evaluations and input from the faculty advisor(s)</strong>. This could result in <strong>a significant decrease</strong> (in extreme cases no marks being awarded for relevant components of the course), <strong>or in a small increase</strong> in your course mark. Failure to submit the teamwork assessments will result in a deduction of up to 5% (2.5% per missed assessment).</p><p><strong><u>Teamwork Assessments</u></strong></p><p>All students are required to complete a teamwork self- and peer-evaluation at the middle and end of term. These have two components: technical contribution, and collaboration and communication (as indicated by helpful and unhelpful behaviours). </p><p><strong><u>Late Submissions, Attendance and Repeat Reviews/Examinations</u></strong></p><p>Late submissions of reports and/or deliverables are penalized at 10% per day. Late attendance to review meetings will be penalized at up to 50% immediately for the individuals who are late. Students who miss a review meeting without prior approval are not eligible for marks for that meeting. </p><p><strong><u>Expected Student Learning Investment</u></strong></p><p>To achieve the learning outcomes defined above, students must invest a minimum <strong>average of 8-10 hours per week.</strong> Team members should (for congruence) <strong>agree upon an average weekly time investment</strong>. The hours/week legitimately invested should be <strong>recorded</strong> by each team member and included as part of each design review, and the final report.</p><p><strong><u>Safety, Regulatory, Sustainability and Professional Ethics</u></strong></p><p>Safety in design must be addressed adequately and appropriately throughout the course. Each team must complete a hazard disclosure form<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>, which they will provide at their safety meeting, and include an updated form in an appendix to their report.</p><p>It is the responsibility of each team to identify, address and rectify hazards related to their project. Note that the disclosure form is a summary only, to highlight key hazards. <strong>More detail should be provided in the presentations, safety review meeting, and report, as appropriate.</strong></p><p><strong><u>Canadian Standards Association</u></strong></p><p>Formal CSA electrical inspections may not be possible. Teams should design as to not require CSA approval, e.g., by using CSA approved power supplies, and keeping below 100 volt-amps. Reference guidelines will be available in Learn and the technical staff can also be consulted.</p><p><strong><u>Sustainability </u></strong></p><p>Appropriate attention must be given to design for sustainability, impact of engineering to society and the environment, regardless of the design project, as with professional ethics considerations.</p><p><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a>Blank forms available on Learn.</p>

Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
