<p>*If a student’s average based on the Mid-term and Final does not constitute a passing grade, the instructor reserves the right to exclude the lab portion from their final mark.</p><p><strong>Pre-lab quizzes</strong>: Prior to performing the labs, students must read the lab manuals and complete a pre-lab quiz on LEARN. The quiz must be completed individually. The following materials are allowed for the quizzes: course textbook, course material on LEARN (lab manuals, slides, study questions), and calculator.  </p><p><strong>Study questions</strong> will be posted at the start of each topic, and the solutions will be posted on LEARN by the tutorial TA. You do <u>not</u> need to submit your study questions, but they are valuable study aids. Please work through these questions and take them to your tutorials.  </p><p><strong><u>Labs</u></strong></p><p>The labs are group-based. You will need to organize yourselves into groups of 3-4 according to your laboratory registration (i.e., 101 or 102) and <strong>sign up accordingly on the LEARN ME 115 course web page (under Connect -&gt; Groups -&gt; Lab Groups) by Monday January 13th</strong>. If you encounter any problems, please contact the course instructor or TAs. </p><p>You will attend the labs based on <strong>your group number and the table above.</strong></p><p>Attendance at all labs is mandatory. If you cannot attend your lab session (e.g. due to a co-op interview), please email the TAs responsible for the lab <u>and</u> Prof. Musselman at least one day in advance. <strong>If you do not attend your lab session, you will have 50% deducted from your <u>individual</u> mark for the lab report</strong>. </p><p>Each group of 3-4 people will be responsible for writing and submitting a single lab report. You will be equally responsible for your group’s laboratory reports. An electronic copy should be submitted via the LEARN dropbox. There will be a late penalty of 10%/day or part thereof.</p><ul><li>Tuesday labs: reports due the following Monday by 12 midnight*</li><li>Thursday labs: reports due the following Wednesday by 12 midnight*</li><li>*An additional two weeks are allowed for labs performed Feb. 11 &amp; 13 (not required to submit labs during Study or Midterm week).</li><li>Lab reports will be handed back about one week after all reports for that specific lab have been handed in. If you have questions about your mark, see the T.A.s who ran the lab, and they will discuss it with you.</li></ul><p> </p>

For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights and academic integrity.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.</p><p><strong>Continuity Plan - Fair Contingencies for Unforeseen Circumstances (e.g., resurgence of COVID-19): </strong>In the event of emergencies or highly unusual circumstances, the instructor will collaborate with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty.

Substantial changes after the first week of classes require the approval of the Associate Dean, Undergraduate Studies.</p><p><strong>Declaring absences:</strong> Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, students are responsible for reaching out to their instructors as soon as possible. The course instructor will determine how missed course components are accommodated. Self-declared absences (for COVID-19 and short-term absences up to 2 days) must be submitted through <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students"><u>Quest</u></a>. Absences requiring documentation (e.g., Verification of Illness Form, bereavement, etc.) are to be uploaded by completing the form on the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/"><u>VIF System</u></a>. The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services"><u>UWaterloo Verification of Illness form</u></a>, completed by a health professional, is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not send documentation to your advisor, course instructor, teaching assistant, or lab coordinator.

Attendance at co-operative work-term employment interviews is not considered to be a valid reason to miss a test.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as preparation of lab reports (technical communication). Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
