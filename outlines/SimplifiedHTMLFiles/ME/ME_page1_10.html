<p>This course is a continuation to ME115 Structure and Properties of Materials. In ME115, you have learned the effect of different levels of structure (Electronic, Atomic, and Microscopic) on a material’s properties and performance. In this course (ME230), we will explore the means to manipulate the microstructure through various processes which will allow us to manipulate the final properties and performance of a material. This course will focus on metals and alloys due to their relevance as engineering materials. Both fundamentals and applications of the various processes will be covered.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>For the project</strong>, you will be working in a group of 3. <strong>You will be free to sign up for your own group up until January 17th on Learn.</strong> </p><p>The project detail will be outlined in a different document posted on Learn under content-&gt; project related files-&gt; project outline. </p><p><strong>Tentative Due Dates:</strong></p><p>Initial Plans and Milestone:January 30th,2025 @ 11:59 pm<br/>Final Report:  March 27th, 2025 @ 11:59 pm</p><p>All project reports must be your own original work. Any material taken directly from other refereed sources such as text books, handbooks or journal articles <strong>MUST</strong> be properly referenced using <i><strong>embedded citations</strong></i>. Please note that most web pages are not refereed and, therefore, are not normally considered to be reliable sources of information for engineering purposes. </p><p>Submission of reports that contain un-cited, copied or plagiarized material from other student reports and/or other external sources, or AI generated partially or fully will be considered an academic offence under policy 71 and reported to the appropriate office. </p><p>----------------</p><p><strong>Tutorials </strong>will be your primary source of example problems and their solutions with explanation for this course. The tutorials will also contain a take-home practice section that the TAs will post the solution (on Piazza) of approximately one week after the tutorial has been posted. Any questions/solutions discussed in tutorial will NOT be posted. </p><p>----------------------------------------------</p><p>Dr. Anton Gorny (<a href="mailto:agorny@uwaterloo.ca">agorny@uwaterloo.ca</a>) will be providing instruction on the <strong>Laboratory Activities (Labs)</strong>. </p><p>You <strong>MUST </strong>complete the 'Introduction to ME230 Labs'  module and the 'MME2A Safety Module' module and obtain a 100% on the questions in order to be admitted into the lab (you will have unlimited retries). The completion of this module will count for 1% out of the 20% allocated for your laboratory reports. </p><p>If you have NOT completed these modules by the time of your first scheduled lab, you will not be admitted to the lab and will receive a zero on your lab component. </p><p><strong>Tentative weeks for labs (dates will be confirmed later in lecture/learn announcement):</strong></p><p>Lab. 1 – Heat treatment of Ferrous Alloys (Hardenability) -  Week of January 20th<br/>Lab. 2* - Heat Treatment of Non-Ferrous Alloys - Week of February 3rd<br/>Lab. 3 – Heat Treatment and Microstructural Changes - Weeks of March 3rd, March 10th (We may need week of Feb 11th as well)</p><p> </p><p>A group-based lab report will be due 7 days after you attended Lab. 1 and Lab. 3 by 23:59 pm and to be submitted into the appropriate drop box on Learn. If we need to use the week of Feb 11th, groups who are scheduled to do labs on the week of Feb 11th, will have their lab reports due date on March 10th. </p><p>*No lab report is required for lab 2 (it is an integral part of your project).</p><p>------------</p><p>There are various submissions for this course, mostly on a group basis. These includes the lab. Reports and the project related submission(s). <strong>Unless otherwise stated, the due time is at 23:59 of the provided due date. </strong></p><p>Unless otherwise stated, the general <strong>late penalty of 10 marks off the total per day</strong> applies for any late submission(s). The submission time logged on the relevant LEARN dropbox will be used for tallying any late penalties. The penalty increment on a daily basis, 10 marks for the first 24 hours it is late, and so on.</p><p><strong>Each student will start the term with 3 grace-day credits.</strong> The grace-day credits are used for no-questions asked extension with no penalty. The number of credits required for a 24 hour extension will be equal to the number of students in the group (e.g. 1 day extension for a group project with 3 members will require 3 credits pooled together).</p><p>Aside from the grace-day credit system, no further extension requests will be entertained except for cases of documented and/or self-declared illnesses, accommodation through the accessibility office or the ME undergraduate office, and other documented absence (e.g. jury duty, court dates, etc.). If these apply, please contact the instructor as soon as you can. Any arrangement should be handled ahead of the deadline rather than after the deadline. </p><p>----</p><p>The TA will try their best to return the reports with feedback in a timely manner, but please understand that it takes quite a bit of time to go through that many reports for one person. </p><p>----</p><p>Any dispute or re-grading request must be submitted via email within 2 weeks of receiving your grade. In this email you should detail where you perceive a grading error exist, and provide reasons why you believe it was graded in error. </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

This may include modifying content delivery, course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines with due and fair notice to students. Substantial changes after the first week of classes require the approval of the Associate Dean, Undergraduate Studies.</p><p><strong>Declaring absences:</strong> [<i>undergraduate students and/or courses only</i>]  Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, students are responsible for reaching out to their instructors as soon as possible. The course instructor will determine how missed course components are accommodated. Self-declared absences (for COVID-19 and short-term absences up to 2 days) must be submitted through <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students"><u>Quest</u></a>. Absences requiring documentation (e.g., Verification of Illness Form, bereavement, etc.) are to be uploaded by completing the form on the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/"><u>VIF System</u></a>. The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services"><u>UWaterloo Verification of Illness form</u></a>, completed by a health professional, is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not send documentation to your advisor, course instructor, teaching assistant, or lab coordinator. Submission through the VIF System, once approved, will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Rescheduling Co-op Interviews: </strong>Follow the co-op process for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts"><u>rescheduling co-op interviews</u></a> for conflicts to graded assignments (e.g., midterms, tests, and final exams). Attendance at co-operative work-term employment interviews is not considered to be a valid reason to miss a test.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as communicating your understanding and scientific findings in written and verbal form. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
