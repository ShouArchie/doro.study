  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ME 599:</div>
<p>Various courses dealing with selected topics at the undergraduate level in automation and control, solid mechanics and machine design, materials engineering and processing, fluid mechanics, and thermal engineering. Courses offered when resources permit.</p>
<div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Become knowledgeable about the automotive industry's vehicle design process following the automotive industry’s <i><strong>hybrid, autonomous and connected, vehicle design</strong></i>.  Such design includes but is not limited to simulation, hands on implementation, industry grade equipment use, application of rapid prototyping processes, and reviews by industry experts.  Students will be exposed to controls, mechanical systems, electrical systems, human-machine interface using the experiential design process (very different from fourth year design project design processes), connected autonomous/automated vehicle technologies (CAVs), emissions, software development, and consumer acceptability considerations.  Learning mode is Project Based.  Students will focus on and implement one or more UWAFT sub-projects selected to match students interest.</p><h2>Application Form </h2><p>Given that this is a very engaging, hands on project-based course, we do not have the resources to accept all students in this course. Each student must submit an application form. Form will be provided at first week introduction meeting.</p>

<h2>
  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I do not identify “Outcomes” for my courses. This is a philosophical and pedagogical position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Objective 1: To become familiar with hybrid and electric vehicles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Objective 2: To have a significant team design experience</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I do not identify “Outcomes” for my courses. This is a philosophical and pedagogical position and consistent with the Senate recommendations for course outlines (see https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/courseoutline-requirements; accessed March 18, 2024). I pursue “Objectives” to the best of my ability which, if done well, and if students do their part, translate to outcomes by the end of the course, i.e., your knowledge is increased substantially. The problem with stating course outcomes is that technically they establish a result expectation regardless of student engagement. In contrast I view learning as a team effort requiring both instructor and student to be committed to learning. My additional personal objective is that every student I teach discovers some element of knowledge enjoyment within advanced vehicle design.</p>

<p>The scope of the project is significantly open. The idea is to allow students to pursue projects of their interest, while gaining experience in the automotive industry and furthering the team. The projects will need to follow the EcoCAR EV Challenge timeline and not inhibit the completion of other deliverables.  Teamwork and integration will be incorporated into the grades for the project. Students <strong><u>must</u></strong> be self-driven and comfortable with self-learning to successfully complete their project.</p><p>The project is in the area of improvement and innovation. The competition goal is to re-engineer a 2023 Cadillac Lyriq to reduce emissions, drive autonomously, maintain performance and customer acceptability. </p><p>There are two parts to ME 599, those who have completed ME 599-1 in the previous term will do ME 599-2. The timeline and grade breakdown outline the difference between the two sections. The exact due dates will be discussed in class and through Slack.</p><p><strong>ME599- Part 1 students will have to attend a 1 hour lecture every week</strong>. ME 599- Part 2 students do not have lectures however the weight of the course is more on their project presentation and project report with higher expectations set for ME599- Part 2 projects.</p><h2>NDA’s</h2><p>Non-disclosure agreements (NDA) must be signed and submitted to get access to confidential information such as CAD, component information etc. ME 599-2 students do not need to re submit it if they have already done so in ME 599-1. The process for this can be retrieved by downloading the UWAFT Guidebook pinned to the uwaftecocar.slack.com General channel.</p><p> </p><h2>Project Proposal</h2><ol><li>Students will define their project details based on the topic given.</li><li>Timeline for the project must be established, including milestones and deliverables. <br/>Note: It is imperative to be realistic with these milestones and deliverables as they will be checked at each Review Meeting (Scrum Meeting) for progress. Project scope moving forward can be re-evaluated and adjusted only with permission. Inability to deliver on time will result in mark penalties for the review meeting. No exceptions, late is late, just as in any other technical elective.</li><li>The team will review the proposal to ensure that it is within the scope of the term and that the student will be capable of completing the project. It should be no more than 5 pages of text (figures do not count towards this page limit), see the marking scheme below.</li></ol><p>FAQ</p><p>Q: I was working on other courses and couldn't meet my milestone on time. Can I have an exception?</p><p>A: No.</p><p>Q: FYDP report was due and I couldn't finish on time. Can I have an exception?</p><p>A: No.</p><p>Q: Can my special circumstance be accommodated?</p><p>A: Possible accommodations are made on a case-by-case basis.</p><h2>Project Proposal Marking Scheme</h2><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Title page</td><td>Project title, Team Members and Group Number</td></tr><tr><td><p>Problem Definition</p><p> </p></td><td><ol><li>points.</li><li>Explain the need</li><li>Provide an overview of what your project will deliver.

The team will ensure that every student has a feasible amount of work expected of them. The Team and the student will review the proposal in detail after submission during the first week after proposal is made.</p><h2>Documentation</h2><p>Students will save work on their local machines or on the UWAFT server as needed. Presentations for the 3 term review meetings should be submitted to the LEARN dropbox following this naming convention: <i>Review Meeting #_FirstName LastName</i>. At the end of the term, student reports should detail any links/file paths to the work that the student has been involved with. Any additional work the student wishes to pass on for UWAFT record purposes may be emailed to the TA’s or uploaded to a LEARN Final Report dropbox. </p><p>FYI: DO NOT SAVE ITEMS LOCALLY (EX. DESKTOP) ON THE UWAFT COMPUTERS THAT YOU REMOTE INTO. THESE WILL NOT BE CHECKED AND MAY BE DELETED UNINTENTIONALLY.</p><h2>Review Meetings</h2><p>UWAFT follows an agile development workflow. Review meetings will occur 3 times over the term (3 week sprints). Procedure is as follows:</p><ol><li>Prepare slide deck presenting work that has occurred in previous sprint. Aesthetics of this presentation will NOT be graded, only the content. This content may include screenshots, embedded demo videos of simulations etc. Anything to demonstrate your work done to date is helpful.</li><li>Submit slide deck at <strong>11:59pm</strong> on Learn dropbox the day prior to your scheduled review meeting.</li><li>Attend meeting to answer questions about slide deck and discuss progress in achieving milestones</li><li>Reaffirm (and potentially set new) goals for the next sprint.</li></ol><h2>Attendance/Discretion</h2><p>Students are expected to be spending at least 8h a week on the course in-person in order to get more fully immersed in team operations. If you wish to interact with a TA reach out to them individually about their in-person availability. Attendance/discretion grade will be based on the participation in the team meetings and staying in touch with the TAs, and ensuring milestones are being met as per projects outlined in the project proposal at the start of the term. If there is schedule conflict with the biweekly subteam meetings, it is student’s responsibility to report their project status to their team lead.</p><h2>Project Presentation</h2><p>The student is to present their work to the class near the end of the term similar to the presentation for the final year design project (FYDP).</p><h2>ME599 Project Report Rubric</h2><p><strong>Tentative Report Rubric:</strong> Note that the actual report marking approach will be communicated to the student if different than below.  Different rubrics are often more appropriate. For example, given many projects are second or third term projects an item like the Background is already known so more emphasis on Integration may be appropriate, etc. </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Description</strong></td><td><strong>Insufficient (30%)</strong></td><td><strong>Poor (60%)</strong></td><td><strong>Good (80%)</strong></td><td><strong>Excellent (100%)</strong></td><td><strong>Mark</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Background Material</strong></p><p>20 Points</p></td><td><ul><li>Low quality information</li><li>Not all background covered</li><li>No references</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Moderate quality information</li><li>Basic background covered</li><li>Low quality references</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Good quality information</li><li>All background covered</li><li>High quality references</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>High quality information</li><li>All background covered</li><li>Multitude of high quality references</li></ul></td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>UWAFT Integration</strong></p><p>10 Points</p></td><td><ul><li>No UWAFT specific information</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Utilized specific UWAFT information</li><li>No real relation to UWAFT project.</li><li>No next steps</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Utilized specific UWAFT information</li><li>Shows how project relates to UWAFT</li><li>Poor next steps</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Utilized specific UWAFT information</li><li>Shows how project relates to UWAFT</li><li>Shows next steps for UWAFT</li></ul></td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Identification of Problem</strong></p><p>20 Points</p></td><td><ul><li>Insufficient problem identification</li><li>Insufficient needs and requirements</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Poor problem identification</li><li>Poor discussion of needs and requirements</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Good problem identification</li><li>Good discussion of needs and requirements</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Problem fully identified</li><li>Demonstration of all needs or requirements for solution</li><li>Link to background information seen</li></ul></td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Solution and Analysis</strong></p><p>20 Points</p></td><td><ul><li>Insufficient solution discussion</li><li>Insufficient analysis detail</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Poor solution discussion</li><li>Poor analysis detail</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Good solution discussion</li><li>Good analysis detail</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Solution fully discussed</li><li>Fully detailed analysis</li><li>Solution fully linked to problem</li></ul></td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>10 Points</p></td><td><ul><li>No real conclusions</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Poor summary</li><li>Poor solution detail</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Good summary</li><li>Good solution detail</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Fully summarized</li><li>Restatement of final solution</li></ul></td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p><p>10 Points</p></td><td><ul><li>Inadequate lessons learned</li><li>No implementation of lessons learned</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Poor lessons learned</li><li>Poor implementation of lessons learned</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Detailed lessons learned</li><li>Good implementation of lessons learned discussed</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Evidence of lessons learned from each member</li><li>Additional detailed lessons learned</li><li>Implementation of lessons learned discussed</li></ul></td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Overall Quality</strong></p><p>5 Points</p></td><td><ul><li>Not well formatted</li><li>Poor grammar/spelling</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Poor formatting</li><li>Major grammar/spelling errors</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Well formatted</li><li>Minor grammar/spelling errors</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Very well formatted</li><li>Insignificant grammar/spelling errors</li></ul></td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Discretionary</strong></p><p>5 Points </p></td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><p><strong>/100</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p> </p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
