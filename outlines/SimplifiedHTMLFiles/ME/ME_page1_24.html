  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ME 362:</div>
<p>Basic equations of two-dimensional flow, potential flow, exact viscous solutions. Introduction to lubrication, boundary layers, turbulence, and compressible flow. Turbomachinery fundamentals and applications. Selected advanced topics.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>The material in ME 362 is an extension of ME 351 – Fluids I covering topics in theoretical and applied fluid mechanics.  Though we will review the main topics from Fluids I at the beginning of the course, familiarity and basic competence with the prerequisite material will be essential for success. The course relies on a solid background in: (1) calculus, including differentiation, integration, partial differentiation, and differential equations; (2) physics, including Newton’s laws and concepts of work and energy; and (3) thermodynamics, including the ideal gas law and the first law of thermodynamics. Since we will not be able to allocate time to review all of these concepts during class time, please brush up on these topics as required.</p><p>ME 362 introduces you to areas of fluid mechanics, both theoretical and applied, which were not covered in the Fluids 1 course. The first part of the course will focus on the theoretical side, and involves the derivation and solution of the coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations that govern multi-dimensional fluid motion. The second part includes applied topics such as compressible flow using approaches and tools similar to those presented in the Fluids 1 course. The aim is to give you an appreciation of the full scope of fluid mechanics, and how the different parts of the subject fit together.</p>

<p><strong>Ungraded homework:</strong>    Each week problems requiring in depth application of the course concepts will be assigned. Complete solutions to these problems will be posted approximately one week after the problems are assigned. It is strongly recommended to <strong><u>do the problems</u></strong> <strong><u>before referring to the solution manuals</u></strong>. Remember that solution manuals will not be available during the mid-term or final exams. Keep up with lecture material and with weekly problem assignments.  Solve problems independently, before looking at solution sets. Exams require problem solving skills which can only develop by regularly doing the assigned problems.</p><p><strong>Project:</strong> There is one project in the course. The project will be performed in groups of four students (groups of three or five students may be accepted depending on total number of groups, five students are maximum allowed in one group). Group sign up will be done through Learn. A list of suitable sports will be provided at the beginning of the term. Each group must choose a sport from the list and include their choice and email Akira Tiesma (TA) the selected sport. The sign-up deadline is <strong>Friday January 17, 2025</strong>.</p><p>Each group must submit a short and clear description of their project (one page maximum, including their selected sport, objectives and methodology) by email to Akira Tiesma (TA). This document will be due by <strong>Friday March 7, 2025, </strong>submitted to a dedicated Learn Dropbox, and will be graded by the TAs. The project short description will count for 2% of the total course grade. This will be used to provide feedback. <strong>No late submission is accepted for the short description</strong>. </p><p>Report writing guidelines will be provided in a separate document early in the term. Electronic submission through the course web site dropbox will be required by <strong>Friday April 4, 2025, 11:55 pm</strong>. The project report will count for 13% of the total course grade.</p><p>The project report has a firm submission deadline. Late submission will receive a 10% mark deduction per day and will <u>not </u>be adjusted to hourly rate or other partial reduction. Thus, if students submit their project report 30 minutes or 1 hour after the due date and time, 10% of the mark of the project report will be deducted. If students submit their project one day and 30 minutes or one day and 1 hour after the due date and time, 20% of the mark of the assignment/project will be deducted, and so forth.</p><p><strong>Important dates</strong></p><ul><li>Friday <strong>January 17</strong>, 2025 11:55 pm (week 2): due date for <strong>project sign-up and sport selection.</strong></li><li>Friday <strong>February 28</strong>, 2025 8:30 – 10:30 am: <strong>midterm exam.</strong></li><li>Friday <strong>March 7</strong>, 2025 11:55 pm (week 9): due date for <strong>1-page description of project</strong>.</li><li>Friday <strong>April 4</strong>, 2025 11:55 pm (last day of the term):<strong> </strong>due date for <strong>project</strong> report.</li></ul><p>All exams are closed book and closed notes. A formula sheet will be provided for the exam. The formula sheet will be provided in advance via the course website to aid in studying. In order to perform well on examinations in this course, you must not only understand how to solve <i>new</i> problems in fluid mechanics, but also be comfortable with the basic concepts. The keys to success are (1) attending <i>and participating</i> in the lectures; (2) reading the textbook; and (3) completing all of the homework assignments.  </p><p>The course outline and assessment breakdown presents the instructor’s intentions for course assessments, their weights, and due dates in Winter 2025. As best as possible, we will keep to the specified assessments, weights, and dates. Weightings may be adjusted to yield reasonable final class average at any time during the term at the discretion of the instructor. To provide contingency for unforeseen circumstances, the instructor reserves the right to modify course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines with due and fair notice to students. In the event of such challenges, the instructor will work with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
</p>
<a></a>
<h2>
  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>Lectures will be recorded and posted on Learn.  The aim is for only the instructor's computer screen and voice to be recorded, although there is a chance that a student's voice asking a question in class will be picked up by the microphone. If, during the course of a recorded lecture, a student has concerns that their voice was picked up and recorded they should contact the professor immediately and he will attempt to remove this segment from the recording before posting to Learn.</p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
