<p>The graded elements in this course will be completed in groups of 3 or 4 students (with group structure to be approved by the course instructor). The work submitted within this course must be newly developed for the course and differentiated from past and current coursework. Any duplication of text verbatim will be flagged as an academic offence.  All deliverables must be submitted through Learn into the appropriate dropbox. Late submissions will not be accepted and will receive a mark of zero, unless an exception has been approved and appropriately documented.</p><p>Groups will meet with the course instructor for a check-in meeting each week. Every week, groups are also required to submit a 1-page progress report summarizing the progress made that week. If a group does not submit their progress report a penalty of -2% to their professionalism grade will be applied.</p><ol><li>Professionalism - student groups will have multiple opportunities to demonstrate professionalism throughout the course. These include arriving for class on time and respectfully engaging with guest speakers, arranging and conducting meetings professionally with the instructor and mentors. Class mentors will complete an assessment at the end of term indicating their impressions of professionalism, which will influence this grade element. Within groups, a work log is also a requirement to demonstrate professionalism and the contributions of each group member. In the case of a grade dispute, the work log will be referenced to determine individual grading adjustments. This is an individual grade assessed the same for both AVIA 602 and 802 students.</li><li>Proposal - to demonstrate a group's ability to create and develop research questions and demonstrate answering those questions is achievable within the timeframe of the course, groups will prepare a project proposal. Students will collaborate on proposals as a group (effort will be made to evenly distribute 602/802 students within each group).  The first task of the group is to decompose their group research question into subcomponents, with one assigned to each student, and prepare individual proposals that collectively will address the group's research question.  While an individual grade, the work should be conducted in close coordination with group members towards the collective question assigned to the group.<ul><li>AVIA 602 Proposal Guidelines -<ul><li>4-5 pages in length.</li><li>Proposals will include a brief literature review to identify knowledge gaps, conceptual and implementation challenges, and situate their work relative to their own fields of study.</li><li>AVIA 602 students are expected to focus more on the practical applications as well as industrial and economic impacts of the question (relative to those within AVIA 802).</li><li>Research question formulation, measurement, study design, and data analysis plan should be included.</li></ul></li><li>AVIA 802 Proposal Guidelines -<ul><li>5-7 pages in length.</li><li>At the PhD level, students are expected to assume leadership and project management roles in their group.</li><li>Proposals will include a brief literature review to identify knowledge gaps, conceptual and implementation challenges, and situate their work relative to their own fields of study.</li><li>More advanced theoretical aspects and/or math and computational models (relative to AVIA 602 students).</li><li>Research question formulation, measurement, study design, and data analysis plan should be included.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Proposal Presentation - student groups will deliver a presentation outlining how they propose to address the challenge presented within the course. Presentations should be 5-minutes in duration per group-member (i.e. 20 minutes for a group of 4 students). Presentation materials must be uploaded to Learn before class time. This is a group grade.</li><li>Final Presentation - the final presentation will present a summary of the group's efforts over the course of the term. Presentation duration will be 10-minutes per group member (i.e. 30 minutes for a group of 3 students). This is a group grade.</li><li>Final Paper - your group's final paper is expected to be conference-level work. It could be a literature and opinion type of paper, but will ideally have some data (e.g., survey/interview or small sample size experiments). If timelines will not allow for data collection, existing data or data shared from industrial partners should be used.  The final paper is expected to build upon and integrate information from the proposal. Your final paper will be a group grade.</li></ol><p> </p>
