<h3>What You Will Learn</h3><p>The Jewish people are amongst the smallest nations in the world and they certainly have been for a long time. We hear about Jews in relation to Israel, the Holocaust, New York, Hollywood, the business world, and many other things. But who are they? What do they do? And what does it mean for a person to be Jewish? These are legitimate questions that this course looks to address, discuss, and answer.</p><p>This course offers a multi-disciplinary, online, and interactive meditation. Ten learning modules expose students to the key elements that make up contemporary Jewish identities — traditional and otherwise — with particular focus on the North American Jewish experience and the nature of Jewish modernity.</p><p>Subjects are approached historically, sociologically, anthropologically, and from a religious studies perspective. As a whole, the course aims to demystify Jews and Judaism by exploring the complexity and variety of Jewish experiences.</p>

  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>No explicit learning outcomes defined for this course.</div>
<div>
<h3>How You Will Learn</h3><p>In each module, you will be guided through a series of "tasks", questions, excerpts from scholarly writings, primary sources (images, texts, websites, movie clips, etc.), and, sometimes, graded assignments or quizzes.</p><p>The modules require you to analyze what you see and read, and to think about how the various aspects of Jews or Judaism you encounter are inter-connected.</p><p>In each module, you will be prompted to answer a set of sophisticated questions. The goal of these questions is to prompt you to make connections with broad themes that preoccupy the course as a whole, and draw out further implications that grow out of your thinking.</p><p>The overall goal of this type of learning is to immerse and actively engage you in addressing, understanding, and analyzing course topics from a perspective that is grounded in everyday life and perception, on the one hand, and in an academic perspective, on the other. By following the lead of the modules and working with other students, you will partake in both.</p><h3>Key Terms that Appear Throughout the Modules</h3><h4>Goals</h4><p>The pedagogical aims for the given modules vary. Instructors have designed each respective module activity with these goals in mind. And the instructors expect you to realize these goals. These will be stated at the outset of each module.</p><h4>Point of Departure</h4><p>Each week will begin with a compelling "Point of Departure", through which you will gain insight into the more complex tensions, forces, and ideas that preoccupy the module.</p><h4>Reading</h4><p>Scholarly readings provide you with a better picture of the module's theme. These readings might be excerpts from books or articles, from long-ago scholarly works, or full essays from scholarly journals from a variety of disciplines (sociology, philosophy, history, theology, etc.). We have tried to keep the reading to no more than 40pgs/wk. Readings have been provided in the course as PDF's.</p><h4>"Consider" and "Questions"</h4><p>There are a number of questions in each module. Questions under "Consider" are there for reflection. Questions under "Questions" are designed for you to take time to record your answers.</p><h4>Responses</h4><p>Each week you will either submit a 1-pg (250 word) <strong>Response Assignment</strong> to the selected topic or issue in the module, or take a <strong>Response Quiz</strong>. Clear directions will be provided and you will see, from the Course Schedule, when a Response Assignment is scheduled or a Response Quiz is scheduled. There will be a total of four quizzes and six assignments. For details on grading, check the Grade Breakdown below.<br/> </p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course.
