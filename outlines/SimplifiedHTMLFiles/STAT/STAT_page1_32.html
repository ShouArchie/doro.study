<div>
<p><strong>Contingencies for Emergency Remote Teaching: </strong>This course outline presents the instructor's intentions for course delivery, assessments, weights, and due dates. To provide contingency for unforeseen circumstances, the instructor reserves the right to modify course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines if/when necessary. In the event of such challenges, the instructor will work with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty.</p><p>In the event of short-term cancellation due to instructor illness/unavailability or longer term university-wide cancellation of in-person classes and assessments:</p><ul><li>in-person lectures will be substituted with (asynchronous) online lesson delivery (narrated lecture slides)</li><li>In-person concept quizzes will be replaced with online quizzes</li><li>the midterm exam will be replaced with an online version to be written at the same scheduled time</li></ul><p><strong>Midterm and Quiz Grade Review Requests: </strong>All requests <strong>must be received within 7 days </strong>of the release of your graded assessment on Crowdmark. To request a grade review, send me an email (<u>pbalka@uwaterloo.ca</u>) <strong>containing the course, your full name and userid, clearly specifying the question(s) you wish to have reviewed. </strong>A long explanation is not necessary or useful. Note that in some cases additional questions to those requested may be reviewed for fairness and consistency. <strong>Assignment grade review requests will not be considered.</strong></p><p><strong>Mathematics Faculty INC Grade Policy: </strong>A grade of INC is awarded to a student who has completed course work during the term well enough that they could reasonably be expected to earn a passing mark in the course, but who was unable to complete end-of-term course requirements (usually the final exam) for reasons beyond his or her control. See: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/incomplete-procedure"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/incomplete-procedure</u></a> for more information on the Faculty of Mathematics' INC policy.</p><p><strong>Instructor INC Policy for STAT 371: </strong>In the case of a missed final exam with supporting documentation, an INC grade will only be awarded if <strong>both </strong>the following conditions are satisfied:</p><ul><li>A minimum (cumulative) average of 50% over all term grading components (assignments/quizzes/midterm)</li><li>A minimum 50% grade on the midterm (note that the midterm <u>must be written</u> to remain eligible for an INC)</li></ul><p><strong>Any student who misses the final exam due to illness and who does not meet the above criteria will receive a failing grade of DNW (Did Not Write, with an associated grade of 32), <u>regardless of the severity of the illness, or whether or not they have medical documentation.</u></strong> Exceptions to this policy will be made at the discretion of the instructor.</p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
