<div>
<div>STAT 221:</div>
<p>Empirical problem solving, measurement systems, causal relationships, statistical models, estimation, confidence intervals, tests of significance.</p>

<div>
<p>This course provides a systematic approach to empirical problem solving which will enable students to critically assess the protocol and conclusions of an empirical study including the possible sources of error in the study and whether evidence of a causal relationship can be concluded. The connection between the attributes of a population and the parameters in the named distributions covered in STAT 230 will be emphasized. Numerical and graphical techniques for summarizing data and checking the fit of a statistical model will be discussed. The method of maximum likelihood will be used to obtain point and interval estimates for the parameters of interest as well as testing hypotheses. The interpretation of confidence intervals and p-values will be emphasized. The Chi- squared and t distributions will be introduced and used to construct confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses including likelihood ratio tests. Contingency tables and Gaussian response models including the two sample Gaussian and simple linear regression will be used as examples. </p>

<div>
<p><strong>Out-of-Class Workload</strong></p><p>As in any university course, much of learning will take place outside of class time. Each week, you have 3 hours of lectures. Therefore, you should plan to spend 3 to 6 hours each week in out-of-class learning. This learning consists mostly of making sure you understand the concepts and steps that were introduced and used in class to solve examples and then solving problems from the Course Notes on your own.</p><p><strong>Review STAT 220 Material:</strong></p><p>STAT 221 relies heavily on material from STAT 220. It is important that you review this material on your own to ensure you’re up to speed and ready for STAT 221, especially if you have taken STAT 220 more than a term ago.</p><p><strong>R Assignments:</strong></p><p>There will be two R assignments. The purpose of these assignments is to introduce you to the free statistical software R. </p><p><strong>Tutorials:</strong></p><p>During the weeks when there are no tutorial quizzes, scheduled tutorials will be delivered by Instructor. See the course schedule. We will use the tutorial time to work through the solutions to some problems from the course notes, prepare you for midterms and the final exam. We strongly recommend that you attend these tutorials</p>

<p><strong>Quizzes, Tests, and Final Assessments:</strong></p><p>Details regarding the quizzes, tests, and final exam (e.g., material covered) will be announced in class and posted on Learn. Students must present a valid Student ID card to write the in-person assessments. Items such as bags, purses, etc. are to be closed and placed under the desk or off to the side. Wireless or electronic devices must also be turned off before the test commences. Seating for the exam will be available on <a href="https://odyssey.uwaterloo.ca/teaching/schedule">Odyssey</a>. Only a non-programmable, non-graphical, Math-faculty approved calculator with a <strong>pink-tie </strong>or <strong>blue-goggles </strong>sticker will be permitted. </p><p>Quizzes will take place in tutorial on the above specified dates. These are meant to be low stakes assessments to keep you engaged with material and prepare you for the test and final exam environment.</p><p>One Midterm Test may be dropped, with the weight shifted to the Final, should you do better on the Final than the worst of your Midterms.</p><p><strong>Final Examination:</strong></p><p>A 2.5-hour cumulative final examination will be held during the final exam period (April 9 - 25, 2025). Please do not make travel plans until the final exam schedule has been posted.</p><p><strong>Absence Declarations, Missed Quizzes, Tests, or Final Assessments: </strong></p><p>There are several ways that students can declare absences when they miss assessments. The <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/absence-declarations"><u>Absence Declarations</u></a> website outlines the different types of absences that you can declare.</p><p>If you miss one tutorial quiz, the weight will automatically be moved to the final assessment with the grading scheme. </p><p>If you miss <strong>a second quiz</strong> or the <strong>final exam</strong> due to illness or extenuating circumstances, then you must email the instructor <strong>within 48 hours of the missed assessment</strong>.  You must provide proper documentation to the instructor as soon as you are able to do so.  In the <u>case of illness</u>, you must first provide a completed University of Waterloo Verification of Illness form, please see: <strong>https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations/submission </strong></p><p>Missed assessments without proper documentation are automatically awarded a grade of 0. </p><p>If you miss a second quiz due to illness/extenuating circumstances <strong>with proper documentation</strong>, the weight will be moved to the final assessment. If you miss all three, then you will receive a 0 on all missed tutorial quizzes (regardless of documentation).</p><p>If you miss Midterm #1 or #2 (but not both), the weight will automatically be moved to the final assessment with the grading scheme. <strong>If you miss both midterms (regardless of documentation), you will almost certainly not pass this course. Therefore, you may consider withdrawing from the course. </strong></p><p>If you miss the final exam due to illness/extenuating circumstances with proper documentation, then the Faculty of Mathematics INC Grade Policy (see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/incomplete-procedure">here</a>) may apply.  It is unlikely that an INC will be awarded to students who miss multiple assessments (quizzes, tests, final). Normally if you have not earned a passing grade on your term work and you do not write the final exam then you will receive a mark of DNW for the course.</p><p><strong>Assessment Regrade Requests: </strong></p><p>All grade review requests <strong>must be received within 7 days of the release of your graded assessment</strong>. Note that when submitting your assessment for regrading, your instructor reserves the right to regrade the entirety which may result in an equivalent, higher, or lower mark than originally awarded.</p>
