  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>STAT 847:</div>
<p>This course introduces Data Science students to exploratory data analysis with a focus on the concepts and tools necessary for understanding and successfully undertaking an end to end exploratory analysis of large and complex data.  All stages of data collection, preparation and cleaning, importation into a statistical programming environment, data manipulation, as well as analysis and visualization will be treated.  Material will be presented via case studies which will involve hands on programming and analysis.  Methods and models (both statistical and computational) will be introduced as needed according to the nature of the data encountered in each case.  The case studies will be chosen to give a breadth of experience to the student. A modern statistical programming language will be used throughout.</p>

<p>This class is entirely hybrid. The lectures and the tutorials will be recorded over Zoom and posted on the course Learn page.</p><p> </p><p>Use this Zoom link if you want to watch the lecture from home</p><p>https://uwaterloo.zoom.us/j/6288899150?pwd=RXNXc0w2dXhkdC9uL05CNnllcS9mZz09</p><p> </p><p><strong>This is a survey course</strong></p><p>The main goal of this class is to give you a go-to library of possible approaches to try. We will focus on the WHAT and the WHY, but for the sake of breadth we will be light on the HOW. That is, the mathematical details will only be covered as far as it serves the use cases presented. A more theoretically rigorous treatment of some of these methods is warranted before using them in a major project.</p><p>You’ll want to know more about a method to justify it to a client, boss, or supervisor. Similarly, you’ll want to have more depth in case something goes wrong or unexpected with the data. But for now, knowing what is possible and how to try it, and where to look for more details is going to get you very far, very fast.</p>

<p>Analysis assignments will be code-heavy applications of the methods learned in class. In previous years, these were based around getting basic summary information from a record of thousands of chess matches from https://lichess.org/ ,  around getting basic information from hundreds of horse races from Woodbine Racetrack (Toronto) and Hastings Racecourse (Vancouver). </p><p> </p><p>Reading assignments will be short form interpretation questions from assigned reading. Last year, the first one was based on Chapter 2 of the book Dark Data, which is about missing data.</p><p>Midterm and final projects will be holistic projects. You are expected to run a complete EDA and write a report. The expectations of the midterm project will be scaled back to reflect that writing and visualization won’t have been covered. </p><p>In the final, you are also given a choice of datasets.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Crowdmark</strong></p><p>Assignments and projects are to be handed in online to Crowdmark as typed PDFs. It’s not required that you</p><p>do assignments in R Markdown, but the assignments are designed with R Markdown in mind. I recommend</p><p>getting familiar with it for the easiest time and best results.</p>

Your email must include a completed Remark Request Form. Please find the form and full details of the process posted on LEARN.</li><li>Late Penalties: A late penalty of <strong>20% per day late, up to a maximum of three days</strong> will be applied to assignments for late submissions to Crowdmark. Please do not email us if you have technical issues that cause your submission to be a few minutes late. No waiving of this penalty will occur for technical issues. Instead, we encourage you to plan in advance and submit your assignments earlier than the moment of the deadline.</li><li>Illness: If you are ill, you must submit a VIF indicating severe illness. (If you are self-isolating due to flu-like or COVID-19 symptoms, you can instead complete the self-declaration form in Quest). Details can be found here: https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations<ul><li>If you are ill for a midterm, you must provide satisfactory documentation within 48 hours by emailing an electronic copy of the VIF to the Instructional Support Coordinator (ISC) as well as submitting to the MUO (or email the ISC in addition to completing the self-declaration). For satisfactory documentation, the weight of the test will be shifted to the final exam.</li><li>If you are ill for the final exam, you will receive an INC grade and be required to complete the exam during the next course offering, if you are achieving a passing grade going into the exam. Further, you must have written at least one of the two midterms to receive an INC. If not, a failing grade of DNW will be assigned.</li></ul></li><li>If at any time you are feeling sick, or have been directed by public health to self-isolate, you should not be attending class. We encourage you to get the lecture notes from a classmate or from a recording on Learn, but if needed please email your instructor directly and we will determine an appropriate accommodation for the situation.</li></ol><h3><strong>Mental Health Support</strong></h3><p>The Faculty of Math encourages students to seek out mental health support if needed.</p><p>On-campus Resources:</p><ul><li>Campus Wellness <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</a></li><li>Counselling Services: counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca/ 519-888-4567 ext 32655</li><li>MATES: one-to-one peer support program offered by Federation of Students (FEDS) and Counselling Services: mates@uwaterloo.ca</li><li>Health Services: located across the creek from the Student Life Centre, 519-888-4096.</li></ul><p>Off-campus Resources:</p><ul><li>Good2Talk (24/7): Free confidential help line for post-secondary students.

Phone: 519-884-0000 extension 213</li></ul><h4><strong>Personal Mental Health Support Message</strong></h4><p><strong>You're not alone.</strong> Lots of people look like they have it together in public and online when they're a mess inside too. You're not the only student facing what you're facing, and it really is okay to seek out help from the above sources if you need.</p><p><strong>Getting help is not an admission of failure.</strong> For the same reason that you cannot walk off a broken leg or a heart attack. It's just a thing that some people need to do.</p><p><strong>It probably gets better.</strong> Obviously, nobody can guarantee that, but it is extremely likely to get better. More specifically, you get stronger and more capable at dealing with the problems in your life.</p><p><strong>You are not your grades.</strong> Grades are not a reflection of your worth as a human being. They got you into university, so they've already done most of the work, but at this point, the most they can really do for you decide if you can get into graduate school before doing industry experience. (And if you're in the graduate version of this class, then congrats! You barely need grades at all now.)</p><p><strong>This too will pass.</strong> Some people will say that being a student was the best time of their life. Don't let that be your reason for thinking this is as good as it gets. Everyone's life path is different.</p><p><strong>Every day's 'best' is a little different.</strong> If you could do your theoretical best every day, then it wouldn't be your best it would be your average.</p><p><strong>Others are not yardsticks.</strong> The takeaway message is NOT 'if they can become a prof with a mental illness, then I should be able to as well.', please don't use others as a point of comparison like that.</p><p><strong>Take care of yourself when you can, don't blame yourself when you can't.</strong></p><p><strong>The world is better with you in it.</strong></p><h4><strong>Diversity and AccessAbility</strong></h4><p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, and that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class. We recognize the immense value of the diversity in identities, perspectives, and contributions that students bring, and the benefit it has on our educational environment. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In particular:</p><p>We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternate/preferred name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the semester so I may make appropriate changes to the records.</p><p>We will honour your religious holidays and celebrations. Please inform me of these at the start of the course.</p><p>We will follow AccessAbility Services guidelines and protocols on how to best support students with different learning needs. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility at the beginning of each academic term</p><h4><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></h4><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo, including items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof)</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course</li><li>Questions or solution sets from any type of assessment</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work used by the instructor with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Sharing this intellectual property without the owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository). Permission is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><h4> </h4><h4><strong>Generative AI</strong></h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Recommendations for how to cite GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
