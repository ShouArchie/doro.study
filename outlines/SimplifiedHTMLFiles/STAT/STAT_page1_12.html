  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>STAT 231:</div>
<p>This course provides a systematic approach to empirical problem solving which will enable students to critically assess the sampling protocol and conclusions of an empirical study including the possible sources of error in the study and whether evidence of a causal relationship can be reasonably concluded. The connection between the attributes of a population and the parameters in the named distributions covered in STAT230 will be emphasized. Numerical and graphical techniques for summarizing data and checking the fit of a statistical model will be discussed. The method of maximum likelihood will be used to obtain point and interval estimates for the parameters of interest as well as testing hypotheses. The interpretation of confidence intervals and p-values will be emphasized. The Chi-squared and t distributions will be introduced and used to construct confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses including likelihood ratio tests. Contingency tables and Gaussian response models including the two sample Gaussian and simple linear regression will be used as examples.</p>

<h3><strong>Course Information Webpage</strong></h3><p>The <strong>course webpage </strong>is available at <a href="http://learn.uwaterloo.ca/"><u>http://learn.uwaterloo.ca</u></a> for the purpose of distributing all course materials and announcements. Critical course instructions will be communicated by announcements and/or Emails so students are expected to regularly visit the course webpage. Please review your email and notification settings.<strong> </strong>We recommend students subscribe to notifications related to Announcements so they don’t miss any important information.</p><h3><strong>Piazza</strong></h3><p>To facilitate discussions during this course, a <strong>class discussion board</strong> at <a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/stat231">https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/stat231</a> will be used. Please only <strong>post</strong> about the <strong>course content</strong>. This includes questions on the lectures, tutorials, course notes, after-chapter problems, assessments, R assignment, etc. For questions related to general <strong>course logistics</strong>, please use the <strong>pinned post [General Questions and Course Logistics]. </strong>Please do not send these questions via email. More detailed rules for posting on Piazza (e.g., naming convention to title a post) are pinned on the top on Piazza. Students are encouraged to respond to questions and help each other. I expect everyone to be respectful to each other, any posts that do not meet the principles in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33">Policy 33: Ethical Behaviour</a> will be removed.</p><p>Response time: The instruction team will try our best to answer questions in a timely manner. TAs will hold 2 live Piazza monitoring hours every weekday. However, please expect a response within approximately 24-48 hours during the week. Piazza will not be monitored in the evenings, on weekends, and/or during holidays.</p><h3><strong>Email</strong></h3><p>If students have private questions unrelated to the course content and course logistics and of a personal nature, please feel free to email your instructor directly. Please send emails from uwaterloo.ca email address and include the session number and student ID number. </p><h3><strong>Continuity Plans</strong></h3><p>In response to decisions affecting the entire University, if in-person lectures are canceled (short-term or long-term), they will be replaced by virtual lectures on Zoom during the scheduled lecture time; if in-person office hours are not possible, virtual official hours will be held through Zoom meetings; if a proctored in-person midterm test is not possible, they will be held online using Crowdmark.</p><p>If the instructor must not attend campus following University's <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/health-and-safety">Health and Safe</a> guidelines, a TA may replace the instructor and deliver the lecture using instructor-provided teaching material.</p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>The following table provides a <strong>tentative </strong>schedule for the material in STAT 231, along with sections in the <i>Course Notes </i>indicated. The material in this course is cumulative and students are expected to attend all the lectures, read all the posted lecture notes, and do the end-of-chapter problems in order to learn the material and prepare for the tutorial tests, midterm tests, and final exam. This learning consists of taking the time to carefully read the course notes on your own, making sure you understand the concepts and steps demonstrated in the lectures to tackle examples, and then solving the end-of-chapter problems. Solutions to the end-of-chapter problems are posted on LEARN. However, it is expected that you attempt the problems on your own first prior to consulting the provided solutions. The weeks for tutorials, tutorial tests, and midterm tests are also provided. Please be sure to take note of the important dates indicated below.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Week</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Monday</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Thursday</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Friday</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>1</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>January 6</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>7</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>8</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>9</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>10</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td> </td><td><p>Welcome</p><p>Couse Outline<br/> <br/>A Brief STAT 230 Review </p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p>1.1 Introduction to Statistical Sciences<br/>1.2 Collecting Data, Types of Studies</p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p> 1.3 Numerical Data Summaries<br/><br/><strong>No Tutorial </strong></p><p>Please use the tutorial period to review STAT 230</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>2</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>13</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>14</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>15</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>16</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>17</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td> </td><td><p><br/>1.3 Graphical Summaries</p></td><td><p> </p></td><td><p>1.4 Probability Distributions and Statistical Models</p></td><td><p> </p></td><td> 1.5 Data Analysis and Statistical Inference<br/>1.6 Introduction to R and RStudio<br/><br/><strong>Tutorial 1 </strong> Topics TBA -

<h4>Out-of-Class Workload</h4><p>As in any university course, much of learning will take place outside of class time. Each week, you have 3 hours of lectures. Therefore, you should plan to spend 3 to 6 hours each week in out-of-class learning. This learning consists mostly of making sure you understand the concepts and steps that were introduced and used in class to solve examples and then solving problems from the <i>Course Notes </i>on your own.</p><h4><br/>R Statistical Software</h4><p>The course notes and lectures use the R statistical programming language for examples. This is the only software that the instructors and TAs will answer specific programming questions about. R and the RStudio development environment can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">here</a>. If you are not familiar with R programming or syntax, the book <i>Introductory Statistics with R</i> by Dalgaard is a helpful resource for you.</p>

<h4>Review STAT 230 Material:</h4><p>STAT 231 relies heavily on material from STAT 230. It is important that you review this material on your own to ensure you’re up to speed and ready for STAT 231, especially if you have taken STAT 230 more than a term ago.</p><h4>After-Chapter Problems:</h4><p>Attempting as many after-chapter problems as possible is key to success in assessments. You will expect to see similar problems in tutorial tests.</p><h4>R Assignments:</h4><p>There will be five R assignments. The purpose of these assignments is to introduce you to the free statistical software R. They will not be submitted or marked.</p><h4>Tutorials:</h4><p>During the weeks when there are no tutorial tests, scheduled tutorials will be delivered by TA. See the course schedule above. We will use the tutorial time to work through the solutions to some problems from the course notes, present you data examples of using R,  and/or prepare you for midterms and the final exam. We strongly recommend that you attend these tutorials.</p><h4>Assessments:</h4><p>All assessments are <strong>proctored, in-person, and closed-book</strong> exams. Details regarding the assessments (e.g., material covered and locations) will be announced on LEARN. You must present a valid Student ID card to write all assessments. Seating for the assessments will be pre-assigned and available on Odyssey.</p><p><strong><u>Tutorial Tests:</u></strong></p><p>Tutorial tests 1, 2, and 3 will be held on Fridays<strong> January 24, February 28, and March 28</strong>, respectively,<strong> </strong>during your <strong>tutorial sessions</strong>.</p><p><strong><u>Midterms:</u></strong></p><p>Midterm Tests 1 and 2 are held on Thursdays at <strong>4:30 PM - 5:50 PM</strong> on <strong>February 6 and March 13</strong>, respectively<strong>.</strong></p><p><strong><u>Final Examination:</u></strong></p><p>A 2.5-hour cumulative final examination will be held during the <strong>final exam period (April 9 - 25, 2025)</strong>. <strong>Please do not make travel plans until the final exam schedule has been posted.</strong></p><h4>Missed Assessments:</h4><p>If you miss a tutorial test with<strong> </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/absence-declarations"><u>Absence Declarations</u></a>, you will score 0 for the tutorial test and the weights of tutorial tests 1, 2, and 3 will be transferred to midterm test 1, midterm test 2, and final exam, respectively.<br/><br/>If you miss one midterm test with<strong> </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/absence-declarations"><u>Absence Declarations</u></a>, you will score a 0 for the midterm test and the weight for that midterm test will be transferred to the final exam.</p><p>Missed assessments without absence declarations are automatically awarded a grade of zero.</p><p>If you miss the final exam due to illness/extenuating circumstances with proper documentation then the Mathematics Faculty INC Grade Policy (see below) may apply. Normally if you have not earned a passing grade (50%) on your term work and you do not write the final exam then you will receive a mark of DNW for the course. <strong>If you miss both midterm tests, or you miss two tutorial tests and one midterm (regardless of declarations), you will NOT be eligible for INC. </strong>In this case, you will automatically receive a grade of DNW. </p><p><br/>You must contact Instructional Support Coordinator <strong>Funmilayo Adeku</strong> <strong>(fadeku@uwaterloo.ca)</strong> about your absence before or within <strong>48 hours</strong> of the missed assessment using your Waterloo email account. In your email, provide your name, session number, and student ID number.</p><h4>Remark Requests:</h4><p>All assessments will be graded and returned electronically using <i>Crowdmark</i>. If you have a question regarding the marking of an assessment, you should first check the posted solutions on LEARN. If you still have a question, then you can file a remark request. Remark requests can be emailed to Instructional Support Coordinator <strong>Funmilayo Adeku</strong> <strong>(fadeku@uwaterloo.ca) </strong>within <strong>1 week</strong> of the feedback being released and must include the following information:</p><ul><li>First and last name</li><li>Student ID</li><li>Course code (STAT 231)</li><li>Session number</li><li>Assessment name (example: Tutorial Test 1)</li><li>Question(s) for remark</li><li>Reason(s) for remark. Please be specific and explain your rationale for a remark.</li></ul><p>Please keep in mind that your grade may be subject to change, either increasing or decreasing, as a result of the remark.</p><h4>Technical Issues:</h4><p>Any technical issues with Crowdmark, LEARN, or Piazza can be consulted with our Instructional Support <strong>Funmilayo Adeku</strong> <strong>(fadeku@uwaterloo.ca).</strong> Please include your full name, WatIAM user ID, student number, course name and number, session number, and any other relevant details (e.g., assignment name). </p>

Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
