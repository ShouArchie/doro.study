<p>The primary objective of this course is to introduce students to generalized linear models. Attention will be mainly directed towards theory and applications involving binary, categorical, and count data, although the generalized linear model will be presented in its full generality for responses from the exponential family. This course introduces several useful regression techniques for the analysis of data arising in many different settings (ie， medicine, industry, psychology etc.). Each new topic will be discussed with one or two applications examined for illustrative purposes. The intended audience consists of students interested in advanced regression modeling. The objectives are to help students develop an understanding of the statistical theory and to equip them with the ability to fit regression models for a wide range of problems.</p><ul><li>Attendance: students are responsible for all material covered and announcements made during lectures and tutorials. In the event that a student is absent from class or tutorial,  they are advised to consult with a classmate to determine what material was missed.</li><li>Cell phones and laptops: should be set to silent and out of sight.</li><li>Course website: Available through http://learn.uwaterloo.ca for the purpose of distributing slides, written notes, assignments and announcements. Please ensure your email settings are up to date so that you receive messages sent to the class.</li><li>Discussion forum: You may also join the discussion forum for this course: <a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/stat431">https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/stat431</a> and post your questions there. One TA (Sijie Chen) and the instructor will check it regularly during the weekdays from 9am to 4pm. You are encouraged to answer your classmates’ questions as well. In the end of the term, top three student answerers will earn an extra credit of 2 points in their final score.</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Assignments</strong></p><p>Assignments are <strong>due by 11:59pm </strong>via Crowdmark on <strong>Wednesday February 5, Wednesday March 5 and Wednesday April 2nd</strong>. The assignment will be posted two weeks earlier than the due date. Each assignment is worth 5% of the final grade. You will receive a personal link to submit your assignment via email at least one week before the due date. Unless prior arrangements are made, no late assignments will be accepted and a grade of zero will be awarded. The weight for missed assignments can not be shifted to the final.</p><ul><li>Rules for Collaboration: Students are encouraged to discuss assignment exercises with each other, the TAs, and the course instructor. Any assistance must be limited to discussion of the problem and sketching general approaches to a solution. Each student must write their own solutions, including code (where relevant). Consulting another student’s solution is prohibited, and submitted solutions may not be copied from any source. In particular, submitting solutions copied in whole or in part from an assignment submission or solution key from a previous offering of this course, or from an offering of any other course, is forbidden, even if a student is resubmitting their own work. These and any other forms of collaboration on assignments constitute cheating. Suspected cases of cheating will be immediately forwarded to the Associate Dean. If you have any questions about whether some activity constitutes cheating, please ask the instructor.</li><li>Software: Students are encouraged to use R for coding problems in assignments, but feel free to use any computing software you feel comfortable with. An introduction to R: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf">https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Midterm</strong></p><p>There will be two in-person midterms on <strong>Thursday Feb 13</strong> and <strong>Thursday March 20</strong> during the lecture times (<strong>1:00‐2:20pm</strong>). Room assignments will be announced via the course webpage and Odyssey. Each midterm is worth 20% of the final grade. If a student missed one of the midterms for a valid documented reason, the other midterm be worth 20% each and the remaining 20% will be shifted to the final. A student is allowed to miss at most one term test for a valid documented reason. </p><p>Please submit your illness form through <a href=" https://uwaterloo.ca/math/vif-submission">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/vif-submission</a></p><p><strong>Final Examination</strong></p><p>The final examination will be scheduled by the Registrar’s Office and held during the University Exam Period (April  10– April 27). Arrangements for students with official conflicts will be handled on a case by case basis. Student travel plans are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time.</p><ul><li>Incompletes: Students who miss the exam for a valid, documented reason will only be awarded a grade of incomplete (INC) if they have an average passing grade (&gt;50%) based on the assignments and midterms going to the final. </li></ul><p> </p><p> </p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
