<p>Project:  This is a group project with 2-3 group members. The outline contains a due date for project. The project deliverable is an &lt;=10 min video. You will also peer review videos of your fellow students.</p><p>Activities supporting in-class analysis: The in-class analysis will require data collection (and possibly other activities). The marks are for contributing to data collection (and possibly other activities). </p><p>Assignments: If you miss assignments for any reason, including "my dog ate the homework", I will shift the weight to the midterm. Likewise, for  VIFs and self-declared absences I will also shift the weight to the midterm.</p><p>Missed midterm:  Any missed midterm will result into an oral exam.</p><p>Failed midterm+project: If you fail both the midterm and the project, you fail the course. Your grade will be the average between midterm and project.</p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) may be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.<br/><br/>ChatGPT/Generative AI: Feel free to use such tools for learning. What you hand in (project / assignment) should be written by you, not by ChatGPT or similar programs. Software that detects whether or not your project is auto-generated essay maybe used.
</p>
<div>
</div>
<a></a>
<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Project: </strong>Team members must contribute to the project in broadly equal proportions. All team members must meaningfully contribute to the analysis and to coding.  For video projects, no team member may read a script that another team member wrote. Projects must not use data sets that one of the team members has used for similar projects in previous courses.</p><p><strong>Assignments:</strong> </p><p><u>Collaboration:</u> Collaboration with other students on assignments is encouraged. You must write up solutions using your own words and write your own programs. </p><p><u>Handing-in</u>: Upload scanned assignment to www.crowdmark.com.  (Uploading the assignments in the last seconds/ minutes before the deadline is at your own risk. Please note that if you upload one file for one question before the deadline, you will not be able to upload any additional files to other questions after the deadline.) Assignment are typically due 9 days after they come out.</p><p><u>Late assignments/ project:</u> You lose 2% of the marks on late assignments <i>per hour late</i>.</p><p><u>Solutions:</u> I am no longer able to supply solutions because a minority of students post them on the Internet. If you have questions about the marked assignments, you can ask the TA’s or myself.</p><p><strong>Appeals:</strong> You have 7 days from the time the assignment/midterm is handed back to you to appeal a midterm or an assignment. (e.g., If you get an assignment back on a Tuesday, I will take appeals until and including the following Tuesday). </p><p>Please send an email to the instructor support coordinator  Divya Lala &lt;divya.lala@uwaterloo.ca&gt; who will coordinate with the TAs.</p><p>The email must contain your name, student id, and  Waterloo email address.</p><p>Give a clear explanation as to why you think you deserve a different mark. It is helpful if the subject line of the email is “STAT xxx: regrade request A#” where # is the number of the assignment. Note: You can gain or lose marks on assignments. Students are frequently surprised that losing marks is not uncommon.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Discussion / Question forum Piazza: </strong>I have set up a piazza discussion forum for this class: </p><p>https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/stat332</p><p>This forum will be monitored by TA’s, Divya Lala, and by myself. If you have questions related to class material or homework please post this question on Piazza or during office hour. I will redirect email questions related to the course material to Piazza (unless you found an error in the slides/ assignment in which case I will react as soon as I can).</p><p>It is your responsibility to monitor announcements on Piazza regularly.</p><p><strong>Software:</strong> You may use whatever software you prefer.  The slides contain examples using Stata. You have to be able to interpret similar output from any software. Because I am more familiar with Stata you are more likely to see Stata output on exams.</p><p>Stata is available for free. You can “remote desktop”. If you remote login for Stata access, you have to use this server: windows.student.math.uwaterloo.ca .  Use your nexus username: “nexus\myusername” (The word “nexus” is needed).  </p><p>If you remote desktop from off-campus, you need to install “connect anywhere” (VPN software) and connect anywhere to "cn-vpn.uwaterloo.ca" before “remote desktop”.  How to install anywhere connect VPN is described here: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/information-systems-technology/services/virtual-private-network-vpn">https://uwaterloo.ca/information-systems-technology/services/virtual-private-network-vpn</a> </p><p>If you use another server, a message will tell you are not authorized to use Stata.  There is a limit to the number of simultaneous users (This limit has so far never been reached/ enforced.)  </p><p><strong>Professional Conduct:</strong> </p><p><u>Posting online:</u> Please remember that everything you post online is in the public domain. Do not post solutions to assignments; do not insult anyone. </p><p><u>Instructor’s name</u>: In part due to my upbringing in Germany, I prefer being addressed by my last name rather than my first name (including in emails). </p><p><u>Recording audio/video/photography of this class (including online interactions):</u> Not permitted.</p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
