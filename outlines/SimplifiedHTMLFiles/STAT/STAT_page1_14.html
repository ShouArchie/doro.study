<div>
<div>
<div>STAT 231:</div>
<p>This course provides a systematic approach to empirical problem solving which will enable students to critically assess the sampling protocol and conclusions of an empirical study including the possible sources of error in the study and whether evidence of a causal relationship can be reasonably concluded. The connection between the attributes of a population and the parameters in the named distributions covered in STAT230 will be emphasized. Numerical and graphical techniques for summarizing data and checking the fit of a statistical model will be discussed. The method of maximum likelihood will be used to obtain point and interval estimates for the parameters of interest as well as testing hypotheses. The interpretation of confidence intervals and p-values will be emphasized. The Chi-squared and t distributions will be introduced and used to construct confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses including likelihood ratio tests. Contingency tables and Gaussian response models including the two sample Gaussian and simple linear regression will be used as examples.</p>

<p><strong>Course overview</strong>:</p><p>In this course we will introduce the 'language' of statistics, and learn about the importance of precision in framing and answering statistical questions. We will explore various methods of statistical analysis, including how to describe data, how to estimate unknown parameters (such as the proportion of a population with a particular disease), and how to conduct hypothesis tests (e.g., to examine the efficacy of a vaccine). The course will address topics from both practical and theoretical perspectives, using real-world examples as well as mathematical derivations. By the end, you will be well-versed in a wide range of fundamental statistical concepts. This will form a basis for those of you who go on to higher level statistical courses, while for those of you with different trajectories, the concepts and ideas explored in this course should help your communication, analytic, and critical thinking skills for years to come.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Illness and Extenuating Circumstances</strong>: Note that a missed assessment will be scored as a 0. However, it is extremely unwise to skip an assessment unless you have to (such as for medical reasons). Because a missed assessment is scored as a 0, if you choose to miss an assessment then you do not need to notify your instructor. </p><p><strong>Assignments</strong>: You may discuss assignments with other students but you must submit your own unique solution written in your own words, and write who you collaborated with on the front page. <u>Assignments up to 24 hours late will receive a penalty of 50%. Assignments more than 24 hours late will not be graded, and you will receive a zero. </u></p><p><strong><u>Important</u></strong><u>: </u><strong><u>If you miss both midterms and are unable to write the final exam, you will receive a DNW (regardless of the reason for missing the final).</u></strong></p><p><strong><u>Important</u></strong>: If you are forced to miss an assessment due to an illness or serious personal emergency then you must follow Math Faculty guidelines for missed assessments which are detailed here: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations/submission">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations/submission</a>. In particular, <i>you must notify your instructor within 48 hours of the due date/end of the missed assessment</i>. <u>Given appropriate documentation and notification</u>, the weight of the assessment will be shifted to the ﬁnal exam.</p><p><strong>Remark Requests: </strong>You may appeal the way an assignment/midterm was marked by <strong>submitting it to the ISC</strong> via email <strong>within one week</strong> of it being returned. Note that remark requests can result in a grade higher or lower than the original. When requesting a remark request, the following information is required:<br/><br/>• First and Last Name <br/>• Userid or Student # <br/>• Course code<br/>• Assessment Name<br/>• Question(s) for Remark <br/>• Reason(s) for Remark</p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.
