  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<ul><li><strong>Due Dates and Times:</strong> Online Quizzes/Tests/Assignments are due at 4:30 EDT (unless stated otherwise above) via Mobius or Crowdmark as per the tentative outline.</li><li><strong>Missed Course Components: </strong></li></ul><ol><li>Arrangements will be made if you miss a course component(s) due to a valid, documented reason. Note for your circumstance to be deemed valid you must have been incapacitated for a significant portion of the assessment window. An illness must have a severity of “severe”.</li><li>A circumstance that incapacitates a student for a month or longer is unlikely to be accommodated – in such a case we ask that you please speak to your academic advisor and consider dropping the course.</li></ol><ul><li><strong>The Process</strong>:</li></ul><ol><li>Within 3 days of your absence end, go to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations</a> and submit a VIF/declaration. Further,</li><li>Email your instructor directly to inform the instructor that you have missed an important course component. This way they can tell you how/if you will be accommodated. If you are accommodated this will likely be done as follows:</li></ol><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Missed Component </strong></td><td><strong>Accommodation, if Provided (see above)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Make-up Exam </td><td>Weight shifted to Make-up Exam in NEXT offering of course. i.e. INC, provided you are doing well in the course which implies you have also completed at least 75% of required deliverables.</td></tr><tr><td>Written Test</td><td>Weight shifted to Make-up Exam OR to written test in NEXT offering of course.</td></tr><tr><td>Assignment</td><td>Weight shifted to next test.</td></tr><tr><td>Online Quiz</td><td>Weight shifted to next assignment. </td></tr><tr><td>Clicker</td><td>See above. No accommodation given.</td></tr><tr><td>Lectures</td><td>Please obtain notes from another student. No accommodation given. </td></tr></tbody></table></figure><ul><li><strong>Rules for Collaboration:</strong> Group work is NOT permitted on the online quizzes and tests. The work you hand in must be your own. If you have any questions about academic integrity please ask the instructor. On an assignment, you may work in a group. More information will be given at the time of the assignment.</li><li><strong>Requests for re-grading:</strong> You may appeal the grading of an assessment by sending an email request to the appeals TA within one week of the date the assessment was returned. You must provide an explanation of why you feel you deserve a different mark. Your grade may go up or down as a result.</li></ul><p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> Sometimes students make rash decisions. In the past some of the issues below have cropped up in my courses:</p><ul><li>Whether you use it or not, having a cell phone or non-approved calculator on your desk during an exam.</li><li>Writing after the time of the exam is up.</li><li>Asking for remarks of tests that were modified.</li><li>Copying from another student.</li><li>Using more than one clicker.</li><li>Using someone else’s clicker or letting someone else use your clicker.</li></ul><p><strong>Copyright: </strong>All material covered in in this course including material discussed in class (i.e. lecture notes), in the course notes, or uploaded to learn are copyrighted. You do NOT have permission to post such information on any website, or to copy such information without the express permission of<strong> </strong><i><strong>Riley Metzger</strong></i><strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong><i><strong>Jenny Tieu. </strong></i></p><p><strong>Photography/Videography/Audio Recording:</strong> </p><p>No photography, audio recording nor video of any component of this course is allowed without prior permission from the instructor. </p><p><strong>Communication: </strong></p><p>You are responsible for checking your UWaterloo email, in class announcements, and learn announcements for information on a regular basis. </p><p><strong>Technical Issues:</strong></p><p>Technical issues, unless they occur to the entire class, are treated as an absence. Make sure you start online quizzes early, hand in assignments early, etc in case of unforeseen technical issues! </p><p><strong>Final Marks: </strong></p><p>Final marks will be calculated according to the outline. If there is any deviation from the outline it will be to the entire class's benefit. Such a deviation would be applied to the entire class, and not to an individual student. Increasing an individual student’s final mark independent of the class would be unfair to the class – such changes do not occur under any circumstance. </p><p><strong>School Closure/Unpredictable Cancellation </strong></p><p><strong>1-Day (Snow day, etc):</strong> </p><p>The class will have been canceled. If this is the date of a written test then the test will be put in Crowdmark, be a take-home test, and will be due the following weekday, at the same time. The class will be made up in a tutorial(s). </p><p><strong>Multi-Day (COVID outbreak, etc):</strong> </p><p>Classes will be put online, in Learn. Any written test during this period will be put in Crowdmark, be a take-home test, and will be due same date as given in the tentative schedule.</p><h3>University Rules </h3><p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> </p><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as: </p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, Make-up Exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner)</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository). Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights. Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent). </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
