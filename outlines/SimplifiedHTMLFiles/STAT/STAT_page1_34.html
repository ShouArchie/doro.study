I’m planning to post the slides Monday and Wednesday evenings.</p><p>Under no circumstances should the slides or any other course material (e.g., assignments or solutions) be posted on the Internet without my explicit and written consent.

<div>
<p>Assignments:</p><ul><li>The 35% will not be divided equally between the 4 assignments. The weight of each assignment will be proportional to its number of points. For example, if assignments #1 &amp; #3 are on a total of 40 points each, and assignments #2 &amp; #4 are on a total of 60 points each; then, assignments #1 &amp; #3 will each count for 20% of your overall assignment grade, whereas assignments #2 &amp; #4 will each count for 30% of your overall assignment grade. Since assignments are worth 35% of your overall Stat 372 grade, assignments #1 &amp; #3 will each count for 7% of your overall grade, whereas assignments #2 &amp; #4 will each count for 10.5% of your overall grade.</li><li>You will have (about) 1 week to complete each assignment after it is posted on the <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home/1097455">Stat 372 LEARN website</a>.</li><li><strong>You are allowed and encouraged to collaborate with fellow classmates on assignments. However, everyone must hand in their own assignment and show that they understood what they wrote. You are not allowed to collaborate with anyone who is not a fellow Stat 372 classmate</strong>; see Avoiding Academic Offenses &amp; Academic Integrity.</li><li>You will thus have to upload your assignments to <a href="https://crowdmark.com">Crowdmark</a>. To ensure smooth and efficient grading, please make sure to upload each question individually. I like the additional flexibility provided by Crowdmark; in particular, that students can submit their assignments without being on campus.</li><li>Assignments submitted late will be penalized. Assignments submitted after the solutions have been posted or after the graded assignments have been returned to students will not be marked and will receive a grade of 0. Note that Crowdmark allows for late submissions.</li><li>However, I recognize that some of you might be dealing with multiple deadlines on or around the same date. I am thus allowing each one of you a one time 3 hour, 1-day or 2-day extension on an assignment with a reduced lateness penalty. That reduced penalty will be 1% for an additional 3 hours, 5% for an additional 24 hours and 10% for an additional 48 hours. Please know that you have to <a href="mailto:cboudreau@uwaterloo.ca?subject=Late%20Assignment%20Submission">email me</a> (at least) 6 hours before the original due date to take advantage of the reduced 1-day or 2-day lateness penalty. Since this is meant to be a last minute thing, you do not need to email me in advance to take advantage of the 1% (3 hours) lateness penalty. However, since it counts towards your one-time reduced lateness penalty, you still need to <a href="mailto:cboudreau@uwaterloo.ca?subject=Late%20Assignment%20Submission">email me</a> to inform me that you want to take advantage of this option.</li><li>If you are unable to hand in an assignment due to illness (with supporting documentation) or other extenuating circumstances (again with proper documentation), the weight of that assignment will be shifted to your other assignments (proportionally; see first bullet under assignments); no alternate/make-up assignment will be granted in this case. If you do not have proper documentation, you will receive a grade of 0 for that assignment. Since you will have (about) one week to complete any given assignment, I do not expect that illnesses will be much of an issue.</li><li>In the above bullet, by <strong>supporting/proper documentation</strong>, I am mostly (but not exclusively) referring to completing a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations/submission">Verification of Illness Form (VIF)</a> or a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences">self-declared short-term absence</a> in Quest (note that COVID-19 now falls under this). Also, <strong>make sure to </strong><a href="mailto:cboudreau@uwaterloo.ca?subject=Illness%20-%20Stat%20372"><strong>email me</strong></a> as soon as possible. That being said, I recognize that we are all currently experiencing extraordinary circumstances, and I will do my best to be understanding/accommodating.</li><li>If you are unable to hand in 2 (or more) assignments (due to illness or other extenuating circumstances), the weight of the first missed assignment will be shifted to your other assignments as described in the above bullet point. However, the weight of the other missed assignments will be shifted to the final exam.</li><li>You have 2 weeks from the day the graded assignment is handed back (via Crowdmark) to appeal your grade.</li></ul><p> </p><p>See my detailed course outline on the <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home/1097455">Stat 372 LEARN website</a> for my detailed policies on assignments and exams.</p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
