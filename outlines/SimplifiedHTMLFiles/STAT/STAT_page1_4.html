I will primarily communicate with you through this platform. You are expected to check your UW email regularly and visit the course website on LEARN. It is your responsibility to stay up to date.</p><h4><strong>Instructor's Office Hours</strong></h4><p>You may attend office hours with the instructor. Come with well-organized questions to make the best use of your time.</p><ul><li>Fridays 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM OR by appointment</li></ul><p>Office hours will be held in M3 - 2101 (Desk 1). </p><p>There are no office hours during reading week.</p><h4><strong>TA Office Hours</strong></h4><p>TA office hours will be announced soon with details provided on LEARN.</p><p> </p><h2>Lectures &amp; Tutorials</h2><h4>Lectures</h4><p>Lecture slides will be posted as unannotated versions prior to lectures.

This approach is based on the principle that deep learning is often facilitated by the physical act of writing and summarizing concepts in your own words. We strongly encourage you to print and annotate the slides, use a tablet for digital annotations, or take your own notes on plain paper during class.</p><p>Additionally, it is recommended to read the textbook sections corresponding to the lecture material each week, as outlined in the course schedule. The textbook offers additional examples to further enhance your understanding of the material.</p><h4>Tutorials</h4><p>Tutorial sections are listed above, except for the first week and the reading week. Please refer to the course schedule below for the specific dates when tutorials will take place. Tutorials will be used to present additional examples and to serve as review sessions for the two Term Tests. We strongly encourage you to attend the tutorials to better prepare for the course assessments.</p><p> </p><h2>Class Discussion Board</h2><p>We will be using Piazza as our discussion board this term.

<p>This course provides an introduction to probability models including sample spaces, mutually exclusive and independent events, conditional probability, and Bayes’ Theorem. The named distributions (Discrete Uniform, Bernoulli, Binomial, Geometric, Hypergeometric, Poisson, Continuous Uniform, Exponential, Normal (Gaussian), and Multinomial) are used to model real phenomena. Discrete and continuous univariate random variables and their distributions are discussed. Joint, marginal, and conditional probability mass functions of two or more discrete random variables and functions of random variables are also discussed. Students learn how to calculate and interpret means, variances, and covariance, particularly for the named distributions. The Central Limit Theorem is used to approximate probabilities.</p><h4><strong>Prerequisites/Anti-requisite:</strong></h4><p>View prerequisites and anti-requisites for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/courses/B1bJZFN7Fh">STAT 220.</a></p>

Assignments will be submitted to <i>Crowdmark</i>. All assignments will be graded and returned electronically. If you choose to type your submission, you can use Word with its equation editor and then save it as PDF, or use LaTeX, whichever you are more comfortable with.</p><p>Late Penalties: Assignments submitted late to Crowdmark will incur a penalty of 20% per day, up to a maximum of two days. Please do not email us regarding technical issues that result in your submission being a few minutes late, as no exceptions will be made for such cases. To avoid any penalties, we strongly encourage you to plan ahead and submit your assignments well before the deadline.</p><p>If you are unable to submit an assignment due to illness or other extenuating circumstances, there is no need to contact the instructor. A grade of 0 will be recorded for that assignment. However, note that only the best 3 out of 4 assignment grades will count toward your final grade.</p><h4><strong>Term Tests</strong></h4><p>There are two Term Tests held during the scheduled test slots. </p><h4><strong>Final Exam:</strong></h4><p>Final Exam will be a 2.5-hour closed-book assessment held during the official exam period from April 9 to 25. Specific dates, times, and format details will be posted on LEARN closer to the end of the semester.<strong> Please do not make any travel arrangements until the exam dates are officially announced.</strong></p><ul><li>Full details for each Term Test and the Final Exam will be posted on the <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home/1046076">LEARN page</a>.</li><li>For both Term Tests and the Final Exam, only non-programmable, non-graphical calculators approved by the Math faculty and marked with a pink-tie or blue-goggle sticker are allowed.</li><li>Students must present a <u>valid Student ID card</u> to write all midterms and the final exam.</li></ul><h4> </h4><h4><strong>Missed Assignments, Midterms, or Final Exam</strong></h4><p> </p><p>If you miss a <strong>Term Test </strong>due to illness or extenuating circumstances, you must send an e-mail to the instructor at <a href="https://outline.uwaterloo.ca/view/n7wx97">blashkari@uwaterloo.ca (</a><a href="mailto:blashkari@uwaterloo.ca">mailto:blashkari@uwaterloo.ca</a><a href="https://outline.uwaterloo.ca/view/n7wx97">)</a> within 48 hours of the missed Term Test. For a missed Term Test with proper documentation, the weight will be shifted to the Final Exam. Missed term tests without proper documentation are automatically awarded a grade of 0.</p><p>If you miss the <strong>Final Exam </strong>due to illness or extenuating circumstances, you must send an e-mail to the instructor at <a href="https://outline.uwaterloo.ca/view/n7wx97">blashkari@uwaterloo.ca (</a><a href="mailto:blashkari@uwaterloo.ca">mailto:blashkari@uwaterloo.ca</a><a href="https://outline.uwaterloo.ca/view/n7wx97">)</a> within 48 hours of the missed Final Exam.

Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-proceduresguidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 (https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-proceduresguidelines/policy-71)</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility, and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI(https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf)</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
