  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>STAT 836:</div>
<p>The objective of this course is to develop understanding and working knowledge of spatial models and analysis of spatial data.  The course provides an introduction to the rudiments of statistaical inference based on spatially correlated data.  Methods of estimation and testing will be developed for geostatistical models based on variograms and spatial autoregressive models.  Concepts and application of methods will be emphasized through case studies and projects with health applications.</p>

<p><strong>Assignments:</strong></p><p>Four assignments will be given during the course, each worth 7.5%. They are designed to keep you up-to-date with the course material and to deepen your understanding of the concepts we cover in class.  The due dates of the assignments tentatively are as follows:</p><ul><li>Assignment 1: Due 11:59pm Friday, January 31</li><li>Assignment 2:  Due 11:59pm Friday, February 14</li><li>Assignment 3: Due 11:59pm Friday, March 14</li><li>Assignment 4: Due 11:59pm Friday, March 28</li></ul><p>Assignments will be released approximately 2 weeks before the due date and must be submitted via Crowdmark. You may discuss assignments with other students but you must submit your own unique solution written in your own words. If you miss an assignment with valid documentation, its weight will be transferred to the final project.</p><p><strong>Midterm:</strong></p><p>A midterm exam will be held in-class, during the course's regular lecture time on Thursday, March 6. If you miss the midterm with valid documentation, a make-up exam will be given.</p><p><strong>Final project:</strong></p><p>The course will culminate in working on a final project. The project will be composed of a short oral presentation (during the last week of class) and the submission of a final written report. Each student will complete a project individually, with guidance from the instructor. You will apply appropriate spatial modelling methods to a real dataset, motivated by a clear scientiﬁc objective. STAT 836 students are expected to come up with their own projects and choose their own dataset, and perform analyses that require some programming and/or methodological effort. Detailed project instructions will be provided later in the term.</p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like ChatGPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will be discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
