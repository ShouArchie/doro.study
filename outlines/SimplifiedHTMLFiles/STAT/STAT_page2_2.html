<h3><strong>ASSIGNMENT POLICIES</strong></h3><p>The three assignments will be <strong>due by 11:59 pm EDT </strong>via Crowdmark on <strong>February 2nd, March 2nd and March 30th</strong>, respectively. You will receive a personal link to submit your assignment via email one week before the due date. </p><ul><li><strong>Submissions </strong><i><strong>before</strong></i><strong> the deadline:</strong> You can <strong>resubmit your assignment as many times as</strong> you like before the deadline.  It is your responsibility to make sure your solutions are visually clear (if your answers cannot be read you will receive a grade of zero) and that each question’s answer is uploaded separately into the correct section. <i><strong>Be sure to give yourself ample time to upload your solutions before the deadline.</strong></i><br/> </li><li><strong>Late Assignments:</strong> Late Assignments will not be graded and will be awarded a grade of zero. <br/> </li><li><strong>Missed Assignments: </strong>Arrangements will be made if you miss an assignment due to a valid, documented, reason. See the section on Accommodation due to illness below. Note for your circumstance to be deemed valid you must have been <strong>incapacitated for a significant portion of the 7-day assignment window.</strong><br/> </li><li><strong>Retrieving Marked Assignments:</strong> A link to your graded assignment will be sent to you via email.<br/> </li><li><strong>Rules for Collaboration: </strong>Students are encouraged to discuss assignment exercises with each other, the TAs, and the course instructor. Any assistance must be limited to discussion of the problem and sketching general approaches to a solution. Each student must write their own solutions. Consulting another student’s solution is prohibited, and submitted solutions may not be copied from any source. In particular, submitting solutions copied in whole or in part from an assignment submission or solution key from a previous offering of this course, or from an offering of any other course, is forbidden, even if a student is resubmitting their own work. These and any other forms of collaboration on assignments constitute cheating. Suspected cases of cheating will be immediately forwarded to the Associate Dean. If you have any questions about whether some activity constitutes cheating, please ask the instructor.<br/> </li><li><strong>Requests for re-grading</strong>: You may appeal the grading of an assignment or test by sending an email request to the <strong>TA</strong> within <strong>three days</strong> of the date the assessment is returned. You must provide an explanation of why you feel you deserve a different mark. Your grade may go up or down as a result.</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Presentation POLICIES</strong></p><p>The presentation will be scheduled at weeks 12 - 13 (tentatively). </p><ul><li>Papers of interest for presentations will be provided to you two weeks before your individual presentation date.<br/> </li><li>Your presentation date and time will be randomly assigned.<br/> </li><li>You have <strong>20 minutes</strong> to present and <strong>5 minutes</strong> for Q&amp;A (This is subject to change depending on the number of students who will make a presentation).<br/> </li><li>Your presentation will be evaluated based on your comprehensive understanding of the paper and the clarity of your presentation.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Project POLICIES</strong></p><p>  </p><ul><li>Project reports (based on some real data analysis) need to be typed and submitted to the Dropbox folder at <strong>LEARN</strong>. More details (e.g., data sets etc.) will be announced by <strong>March 15th</strong>.</li><li><strong>Alternative Options for Written Report</strong>:<br/>If you are interested in ideas in journal papers related to the course, you are also allowed to write a<br/>review paper. Additionally, for students who have original ideas on multivariate analysis, a research<br/>essay is acceptable as well. Make sure that the paper or the research topic chosen by you is<br/>approved by me.</li><li><strong>Grading of the Projects</strong><br/>General clarity and correctness of writing are required for all three options.<br/>• For the first option, we will grade your reports on the statement of problem and data, statistical analysis performed, and conclusions.<br/>• For the second option, we will be more concerned about whether you can make critical comments on the paper you choose to review.<br/>• For the third option, we will focus on originality of your ideas in your research essay.<br/> </li><li>It will be due <strong>due by 11:59 pm EDT </strong>on <strong>April 13th</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p>      </p><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy

<div>
<p><strong>Changes to in-class Meeting Schedule and other Covid related Circumstances:</strong></p><p>It is possible, due to Covid-19, that the university may need to cancel classes for a short period of time and/or transition from in person instruction to an online format during the term (and with short notice). In the event of a university required change, using an appropriate technology platform we will adopt an alternative meeting schedule that mirrors/matches the existing in-person meeting schedule for the course/section as much as possible, . </p><p><i>Any on-campus in-person assessments that require modification due to a university mandated change connected to in-person gathering will, if necessary, proceed in a manner that best achieves the intentions of the original assessment format. Any necessary changes will be communicated as soon as we reasonably can during the course of the term. </i></p><p>If you are required to self-isolate as a result of Covid-19 and unable to attend in person classes, the expectation is that all other course obligations can be met except for anything related to direct in-person attendance. In circumstances where your ability to complete course obligations are impacted, you should use the Accommodations due to Illness and related instructions below in order to provide notification of the circumstances to your instructor. </p><p>The university has a self-declaration process that can be followed for anyone who is diagnosed with Covid-19 during the term. This self-declaration is a first step for any necessary course related accommodations for any student experiencing related symptoms. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Accommodation due to Illness</strong>: Students self-isolating due to flu-like or COVID-19 symptoms should be completing short-term absence declaration form on Quest. This form allows students to self-declare an absence of 48 hours with no documentation required. Students are limited to submitting once per term, and only during the lecture period.</p><p>When you believe your illness (different from COVID-19) or circumstances will impact your academic studies you must follow the instructions on the Faculty of Mathematics' <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations">Accommodations</a> webpage. In verified cases, typically the weight of the missed assessment will be moved to the final exam, however the decision is at the discretion of the instructor.  </p><p><strong>Intellectual Property and Copyright Notice</strong>: The course notes, lecture slides, assignments, exams, and written lecture notes provided to you are all under the copyright of the current and previous course instructor(s). These materials are made available for the personal use of students registered in the Fall 2022 offering of Stat 330. Students may not distribute or reproduce these materials for commercial or non-commercial means. Failure to abide by these conditions is a breach of copyright and an academic offence (see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a>). </p><p><strong>Mental Health Support</strong>: The Faculty of Math encourages students to seek out mental health support if needed.</p><ul><li>On-campus Resources:<ul><li>Campus Wellness <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</a></li><li>Counselling Services: counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca 519-888-4567 ext 32655</li><li>MATES: one-to-one peer support program offered by Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) and Counselling Services: mates@wusa.ca</li><li>Health Services: located across the creek from the Student Life Centre, 519-888-4096.</li></ul></li><li>Off-campus Resources:<ul><li>Good2Talk (24/7): Free confidential help line for post-secondary students.

Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In particular:</p><ul><li>We will gladly honour your request to address you by an alternate/preferred name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the semester so we may make appropriate changes to our records.</li><li>We will honour your religious holidays and celebrations. Please inform of us these at the start of the course.</li><li>We will follow Accessibility Services guidelines and protocols on how to best support students with different learning needs.</li></ul><p> </p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
