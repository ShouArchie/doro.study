  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>STAT 936:</div>
<p>This course covers methods for analyzing data in which repeated measures have been obtained for individuals in health studies over time. Different methods will be discussed to handle both continuous and discrete longitudinal response data, with examples from biomedical and population health datasets. Some of the approaches covered will include linear, non-linear, and generalized linear mixed effects models, as well as generalized estimating equations and transition models, with distinctions drawn between subject-specific and population averaged approaches for generalized linear longitudinal response data. Also, there will be coverage of exploratory methods, evaluation of model assumptions and adapting to assumption violations, approaches for handling missing data, and treatment of advanced topics such as semiparametric and nonparametric models for longitudinal data. Software (e.g. R or SAS) will be used throughout the course.</p>

<p><strong>Assignments</strong>: There will be 3 assignments, each worth 15% of your final grade. They will be a combination of theoretical/analytical problems, data analysis, R coding and/or simulations. They are tentatively due at 5pm EST on the following dates:</p><ul><li>Assignment 1: 5pm Thursday, February 6, 2025</li><li>Assignment 2: 5pm Thursday, February 27, 2025</li><li>Assignment 3: 5pm Thursday, March 20, 2025</li></ul><p>Assignments will be released roughly 1.5 weeks before they are due and must be submitted via Crowdmark. You may discuss assignments with other students but you must submit your own unique solution written in your own words, and write who you collaborated with on the front page. Assignments up to 24 hours late will receive a penalty of 50%. Assignments more than 24 hours late will not be graded, and you will receive a zero.</p><p><strong>Rules for Collaboration:</strong> Students are encouraged to discuss assignment exercises with each other, but any assistance must be limited to discussion of the problem and sketching general approaches to a solution. Each student must write their own solutions, including code (where relevant). Consulting another student’s solution is prohibited, and submitted solutions may not be copied from any source. In particular, submitting solutions copied in whole or in part from an assignment submission or solution key from a previous offering of this course, or from an offering of any other course, is forbidden, even if a student is resubmitting their own work. These and any other forms of collaboration on assignments constitute cheating. Suspected cases of cheating will be immediately forwarded to the Associate Dean. If you have any questions about whether some activity constitutes cheating, please ask the instructor.</p><p><strong>Illness and Extenuating Circumstances:</strong> If you are unable to complete an assignment due to severe illness or extenuating circumstances, please email the instructor before the deadline. </p><p><strong>Remark Requests:</strong> You may appeal the way an assignment was marked by submitting it to the instructor via email within one week of it being returned. Note that remark requests can result in a grade higher or lower than the original. When requesting a remark request, the following information is required:</p><ul><li>First and Last Name</li><li>Userid or Student #</li><li>Course code</li><li>Assessment Name</li><li>Question(s) for Remark • Reason(s) for Remark</li></ul><p><strong>Final Presentation &amp; Report: </strong>There will be a final presentation and a final report. Detailed instruction will be shared later during the term. The final report will be due before the final lecture, and the presentations will take place during lecture time. </p>

However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository). Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/> </p><p> </p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
