<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>STAT 330:</div>
<p>This course provides a mathematically rigorous treatment for topics covered in STAT230 and 231, and to make essential extensions to the multivariate case. Maximum likelihood estimation. Random variables and distribution theory. Generating functions. Functions of random variables. Limiting distributions. Large sample theory of likelihood methods. Likelihood ratio tests. Joint probability (density) functions, marginal probability (density) functions, and conditional probability (density) functions of two or more random variables are discussed. Topics covered include independence of random variables, conditional expectation and the determination of the distribution of functions of random variables using the cumulative distribution method, change of variable and moment generating functions. Properties of the Multinomial and Bivariate Normal distributions are proved. Limiting distributions, including convergence in probability and convergence in distribution, are discussed. Important results, including the Weak Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem, Slutsky's theorem, and the Delta Method, are introduced with applications. The maximum likelihood method is discussed for the multi-parameter case. Asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimator are examined and used to construct confidence intervals or regions. Tests for simple and composite hypotheses are constructed using the Likelihood Ratio Test.</p>

<p><strong>LECTURES</strong></p><ul><li>Tutorial: tutorials will be used for going over solutions of practice problem sets and holding term tests. Tutorials will be held only when notified by emails from the instructor (tentative schedules of tutorials are posted in the syllabus; see the table below). Tutorials will be given by one of the TAs (Xianwei Li).</li><li>Course Web Page: Available through http://learn.uwaterloo.ca for the purpose of distributing practice problems, solutions, and announcements. Please ensure your email settings are up to date so that you receive messages sent to the class.</li><li>Attendance: students are responsible for all material covered and announcements made during lectures and tutorials. In the event that a student is absent from class or tutorial,  they are advised to consult with a classmate to determine what material was missed.</li><li>Cell phones and laptops: should be set to silent and out of sight.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>DISCUSSION FORUM</strong></p><p>This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. Two TAs (Jay Sivathayalan and Jingcheng Yu) and the instructor will be monitoring the Piazza and answering questions during the weekdays from 9am to 4pm. Students are encouraged to answer questions from other classmates. In the end of the term, top three student answerers will earn an extra credit of 2 points in their final scores.</p><p>Find our class signup link at: <a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/stat330">https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/stat330</a></p>

<p><strong>Term Tests</strong></p><p>There will be three term tests during the tutorial time slot. They will be held on Tuesday January 28th, Tuesday March 4th, and Tuesday April 1st. Room assignments will be announced via the course webpage and Odyssey. If you have a conflict with the test time you must inform your instructor at least two weeks before the examination. The cut offs for content covered on the test will be announced on Learn. Term tests are worth 45% of the final grade in total: The highest two scores will be worth 20% each and the lowest score will be worth 5%.  If a student missed one of the term tests for a valid documented reason, the other two will be worth 20% each and the remaining 5% will be shifted to the final. A student is allowed to miss at most one term test for a valid documented reason.</p><p>Please submit your illness form through <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/vif-submission">https://uwaterloo.ca/math/vif-submission</a></p><p><strong>Final Examination</strong></p><p>The final examination will be scheduled by the Registrar’s Office and held during the University Exam Period (April  10– April 27). The final exam is worth 55% of the final grade. Arrangements for students with official conflicts will be handled on a case by case basis. Student travel plans are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time.</p><ul><li>Incompletes: Students who miss the exam for a valid, documented reason will only be awarded a grade of incomplete (INC) if they have a passing grade (&gt;50%) on the three term tests going in to the final exam.</li></ul><p> </p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
