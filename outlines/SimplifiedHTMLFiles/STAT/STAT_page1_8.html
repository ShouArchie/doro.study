  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>STAT 230:</div>
<p>This course provides an introduction to probability models including sample spaces, mutually exclusive and independent events, conditional probability and Bayes' Theorem. The named distributions (Discrete Uniform, Hypergeometric, Binomial, Negative Binomial, Geometric, Poisson, Continuous Uniform, Exponential, Normal (Gaussian), and Multinomial) are used to model real phenomena. Discrete and continuous univariate random variables and their distributions are discussed. Joint probability functions, marginal probability functions, and conditional probability functions of two or more discrete random variables and functions of random variables are also discussed. Students learn how to calculate and interpret means, variances and covariances particularly for the named distributions. The Central Limit Theorem is used to approximate probabilities.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Post-requisite:</strong></p><p>STAT 231 relies very heavily on the concepts from STAT 230. It is recommended that you take STAT 231 as soon as possible after completing STAT 230. To move forward to STAT 231, you only need a passing grade (50%) in STAT 230. However, to take upper-year STAT courses such as 330, 333, 334, or 340, you need a <u>minimum grade</u> of 60% in STAT 230.</p><p><strong>Lectures and Slides:</strong></p><p>Lectures will be held in person three times a week according to the class schedule above.</p><p>Lecture slides and course notes will be posted on the STAT 230 <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/le/content/1097524/Home">LEARN</a> website.</p><p><i>Please note that lecture slides or any other course materials (e.g., assessment questions or solutions) should not be posted on the Internet without the explicit and written consent of the instructors.<strong> </strong></i>Please see the<strong> </strong><i><strong>Intellectual Property and Copyright Notice</strong></i><strong> </strong>below for details.</p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>The following table provides a <strong>tentative schedule</strong> for the material you are responsible for in STAT 230, along with sections in the <i>Course Notes</i> indicated. The material in this course is cumulative. You are expected to attend all the lectures, read all the posted lecture notes, and do the end-of-section problems to learn the material and prepare for the quizzes, midterm tests, and final exams. This learning consists of taking the time to carefully read the lecture notes on your own, ensuring you understand the concepts and steps demonstrated in the lectures to tackle examples, and then solving the end-of-section problems. Solutions to the end-of-section problems will be posted in a timely fashion on the <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home/1097524">LEARN</a> course website. However, you are expected to attempt the problems on your own before consulting the provided solutions. The weeks for tutorials, tutorial quizzes, and midterm tests are also provided.

See below for details.</p><ul><li>Tutorial quizzes will be closed book and run during your scheduled tutorial section (pre-seating will be used).</li><li>Review tutorials are optional but highly encouraged and will be used to review content that will be tested on the different assessments.</li></ul><p><strong><u>Out-of-Class Workload</u>:</strong> </p><p>As in any university course, much of your learning in this course will take place outside of class time. Each week, you have three hours of lectures. Therefore, you should plan to spend between 3 and 6 hours each week in out-of-class learning. This learning consists mainly of ensuring you understand the concepts and steps used in class to solve problems and then solving exercises from the <i>Course Notes</i> on your own.</p><p><strong><u>Missed Lectures</u>:</strong> </p><p>If you miss lectures, <u>you are responsible</u> for finding out what you missed from a classmate and learning the course material using the <i>Course Notes</i> and lecture slides posted on LEARN. Instructors will not respond to requests for help with missed lectures. Also, instructors may annotate lecture slides during class time, but these annotations may not be available on LEARN after the lecture.</p>

<p>This grading scheme minimizes the impact of poor performance on either of the two midterm tests and quizzes.</p><p>Information about the tutorial quizzes, midterm tests, and the final exam (e.g., room locations) will be posted on the <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home/1097524">LEARN</a> course website.</p><p>Students must present a <u>valid Student ID card or another photo ID</u> to write all tutorial quizzes, term tests, and the final exam.</p><p>Only a non-programmable, non-graphical, math-faculty-approved calculator with a pink tie or blue goggle sticker will be allowed for the tutorial quizzes, term tests, and the final exam.</p><p><i>Every student in all sections is treated the same way according to this grading scheme.</i></p><p><strong><u>Tutorial Quizzes:</u></strong></p><p>You <strong>must attend </strong>the tutorial section in which you are registered! The date and<strong> </strong>time of tutorial quizzes are listed in the table of tentative schedules above.</p><p>If you <strong>miss a Tutorial Quiz</strong> for whatever reason, there is no need to e-mail the ISC or instructors. Remember that your Quiz Mark for the course will be comprised of taking your best 3 out of 5 quizzes. Therefore, you <strong>must write at least three of the five quizzes</strong>. We will <strong><u>not</u></strong> provide make-up quizzes or weight adjustments if you miss the quizzes for any reason. That is, <strong>any missed quiz will automatically be awarded a grade of 0</strong>.</p><p><strong><u>Midterm Tests:</u></strong></p><p>The date and time of the midterm tests are listed in the table of tentative schedules above.</p><p>If you <strong>miss a Midterm Test</strong> due to illness or extenuating circumstances, you must e-mail Divya Lala at <a href="mailto:divya.lala@uwaterloo.ca">divya.lala@uwaterloo.ca</a> within 48 hours of the missed Midterm Test. The weight will be shifted to the Final Exam for a missed Midterm Test with proper documentation.</p><p>Missed Midterm Tests without proper documentation are automatically awarded a grade of 0.</p><p>If you miss both Midterm Tests and you do not write the Final Exam, you will be ineligible for an INC. In this case, you will automatically receive a Did Not Write (DNW) grade.</p><p><strong><u>Final Exam:</u></strong></p><p>A 2.5-hour final cumulative examination will be held during the final exam period in April. The Registrar's Office will announce the date and location of the final exam later in the term. <strong>Please do not make any travel plans before the final exam schedule is posted.</strong></p><p>If you <strong>miss the Final Exam</strong> due to illness or extenuating circumstances, you must e-mail Divya Lala at <a href="mailto:divya.lala@uwaterloo.ca">divya.lala@uwaterloo.ca</a> within 48 hours of the missed Final Exam. If you miss the Final Exam with proper documentation, then the <a href="https:// uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/incomplete-procedure">Mathematics Faculty INC Grade Policy</a> will apply.</p><p>Normally, if you have not earned a passing grade on your term work and do not write the Final Exam, you will receive a mark of DNW for the course.</p><p><strong><u>Accommodations:</u></strong></p><p>In the <u>case of illness</u>, you may declare your absence or submit a completed University of Waterloo Verification of Illness Form (VIF) to the Math Undergraduate Office, MC 4022. Remember to e-mail Divya Lala at <a href="mailto:divya.lala@uwaterloo.ca">divya.lala@uwaterloo.ca</a> within 48 hours of a missed Midterm Test or Final Exam. No documentation is needed for a missed Tutorial Quiz, as we take your best 3 out of 5 quizzes unless you miss at least three.</p><p>See the Faculty of Mathematics' <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/accommodations/submission">Accommodations</a> webpage for further details.</p><p>In the <u>case of extenuating circumstances</u>, you must provide sufficient documentation via e-mail to Divya Lala at <a href="mailto:divya.lala@uwaterloo.ca">divya.lala@uwaterloo.ca</a> as soon as possible to verify your absence's circumstances.</p><p><strong><u>Re-mark Requests:</u></strong></p><p>All assessments will be graded and returned electronically using Crowdmark. If you have a question about re-marking your assessment, you should first check the posted solutions on the <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home/1097524">LEARN</a> course website. If you still have a question, you should follow the procedure posted on the course website on <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home/1097524">LEARN</a> once an assessment has been graded and feedback has been returned to you. When an assessment is returned to you, you have <u>one week</u> to appeal a grade (no exceptions will be made for any reason).</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Cancellation of In-Person Classes: </strong></p><p>In the event of a short or long-term cancellation of in-person classes (e.g. due to the pandemic), we intend for the following changes to apply: 1) In-person lectures will be replaced with weekly videos, which may not be synchronous. 2) Tutorial Quizzes will be replaced with Mobius quizzes, to be completed within the tutorial day. 3) Midterm Tests and Exams will occur according to the course schedule but will be completed online and synchronously rather than in-person. Some components may need to be submitted via Crowdmark. 4) The course's grading scheme will remain the same. The instructors reserve the right to modify these plans with due and fair notice to students if unforeseen circumstances prevent the implementation of this plan.</p><p><strong>Intellectual Property and Copyright Notice:</strong></p><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course;</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exam); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored/used by the instructor/TA, with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>These materials are made available for the personal use of students registered in the Winter 2025 offering of STAT 230. Students may not distribute or reproduce these materials for commercial or non-commercial means. Failure to abide by these conditions is a breach of copyright and an academic offence (see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a>).</p><p><strong>Generative AI:</strong></p><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills for solving real-life problems using introductory probability rules. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
