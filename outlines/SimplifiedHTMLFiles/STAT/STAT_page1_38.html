<p><strong>Goals: </strong>Reducing the variation in process outputs is a key part of process improvement. Excess variation has dire consequences. It can lead to scrap, rework, the need for added inspection, customer returns, impairment of function and a reduction in reliability and durability. Reducing variation can lower overall cost and simultaneously improve customer satisfaction. This course is structured around a systematic algorithm for reducing process variation and thus improving existing manufacturing and assembly processes.</p>

<p><strong>Watfactory Process Improvement Game Reports, Presentations and Management Review Meetings:</strong> </p><p>You will work in (self-selected) teams of 3 and I will assign each team a different version of the virtual process “Watfactory” to improve. See the Process Improvement Game write-up for more details on the reports and presentations. The purpose of the process improvement “game” is to give you experience applying the ideas and tools in the Statistical Engineering algorithm, and to help prepare you for the midterm test and final assessment.</p><p><strong>The Writing Centre: </strong>The Writing Centre works across all faculties to help students clarify their ideas, develop their voices, and write in the style appropriate to their disciplines. Writing Centre staff offer one-on-one support in planning assignments and presentations, using and documenting research, organizing and structuring papers, and revising for clarity and coherence. You can make multiple appointments throughout the term. To book an appointment visit <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/writing-centre">www.uwaterloo.ca/writing-centre</a>. Group appointments for team-based projects, presentations, and papers are also available. Please note that writing specialists guide you to see your work as readers would. They can teach you revising skills and strategies but will not proofread or edit for you. Please bring hard copies of your assignment instructions and any notes or drafts to your appointment.  </p><p><strong>Teamwork</strong>: This course involves teamwork for the assignments and presentation (midterm and final exam are individual). The tentative presentation schedule can handle at most 9 teams. Team size is dependent on the number of enrolled students. Below are links to some UW resources that may help you work effectively in a group.</p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/catalogs/tip-sheets/making-group-contracts">Making Group Contracts | Centre for Teaching Excellence | University of Waterloo (uwaterloo.ca)</a></p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/catalogs/tip-sheets/meeting-strategies-group-work">Meeting Strategies for Group Work | Centre for Teaching Excellence | University of Waterloo (uwaterloo.ca)</a></p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/catalogs/tip-sheets/teamwork-skills-being-effective-group-member">Teamwork Skills: Being an Effective Group Member | Centre for Teaching Excellence | University of Waterloo (uwaterloo.ca)</a></p><p><strong>Computing:</strong> In this class, the use of some statistical software is essential. You will be assigned Nexus and UNIX accounts. Throughout the term, in videos, textbook and on assessments, I will show MINITAB statistical software (available on Nexus, thanks to the Math Endowment Fund) output. It is your responsibility to be sure you understand the MINITAB results. You can access Nexus using remote desktop (mef-nts.math.uwaterloo.ca) from your home computer. You can also download a trial version (valid for 30 days) from minitab.com. However, you are free to use any statistics package you wish, including R, SPSS and SAS (Excel is probably a poor choice!). </p>

  University Policy

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
