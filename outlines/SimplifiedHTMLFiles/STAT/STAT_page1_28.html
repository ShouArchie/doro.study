<p><i><u>There is NO final exam in this course. </u></i></p><p><strong>Midterm Rules</strong></p><p>Please check Odyssey for your room and seat prior to each exam. The focus of each midterm is the material discussed since the previous midterm; e.g., the focus of Midterm 3 is the material discussed after Midterm 2. </p><p><strong>Assignment Rules</strong></p><p>The four assignments can be submitted in groups of up to and including two students. Moreover, all assignments are handled by Crowdmark. Make sure your name only appears on precisely one assignment (otherwise the minimum is applied). Justify all your answers; a correct answer without justification or derivation will only give a minor fraction of marks. Solutions to R exercises have to be reproducible, show all source code, with comments, and relevant output (such as numbers or plots). Unless stated otherwise, <i>using R markdown or LaTeX is required</i> for all assignments and hand-written solutions and/or imported screenshots may lead to a penalty of up to 30% per question. A RMarkdown and LaTeX template is available on Learn. </p><p><strong>Tutorial Quiz Rules</strong></p><p>The tutorial quizzes will be run in two stages. First, in Stage 1, each student gets a paper with questions that they work on individually and submit after 20 minutes. These papers are then collected. Next, in Stage 2, a new set of papers with questions is distributed (with very similar or even identical questions). In the next 20 minutes, you can work on that second set of questions, and this time, you are allowed to collaborate with anybody in the classroom! The overall grade of each quiz is then a weighted average of the Stage 1 and Stage 2 components. </p><p><strong>Diary Entry Rules</strong></p><p>In order for you to track your progress throughout the course, there will be a form of an online diary on Learn, where you are asked to reflect on certain questions (for example, ”What were my major mistakes in Quiz 1?”). This also helps me gathering feedback from you. The diary entries are handled via Crowdmark and are graded by completeness. </p><p><strong>iClicker Rules</strong></p><p>Through the use of iClicker, you can earn up to 2% on top of your grade. Each lecture will have a couple of iClicker questions, each worth 2 marks (1 mark for participation; 1 mark for correctness). At the end, everyone's clicker mark will be divided by 0.75 to allow for absences. <i>No further accommodation will be provided for any reason.</i></p><p><strong>Missed assessment policy</strong></p><p><i>Assignments:</i> Given that there are at least 7 days to solve the assignment, unless prior arrangements are made or extenuating circumstances are documented, no late assignments will be accepted and a grade of zero will be awarded. Any arrangements for extenuating circumstances are at the discretion of the instructor.</p><p><i>Midterms: </i>If you miss a midterm due to illness or other reasons, you must inform your Instructor within 48 hours. If proper documentation is provided (VIF, self-declared absence, . . . ), usually a make-up examination will take place at a time mutually agreed-upon. It is at the instructor’s discretion whether this examination is oral or written. Only in the most extenuating circumstances will the weight of a missed midterm be distributed over the remaining midterms, which is also at the instructor's discretion.</p><p><i>Tutorial Quiz: </i>If you miss a quiz due to illness or other reasons, you must inform your Instructor within 48 hours. If proper documentation is provided (VIF, self-declared absence, . . . ), the weight of the missed quiz is redistributed among the remaining quizzes. </p><p><i>Diary Entries: </i>No late diary entries will be accepted similar to "Assignments" above.</p><p><i>iClickers:</i> No accommodations will be made for any reason; the final iClicker score is divided by 0.75 for everybody to accommodate for missed lectures. </p><p><strong>Regrading policy</strong></p><p>Requests for regrading a document must be made within 7 days after the document has been returned to you. To have your document considered for regrading you must formulate a request in writing by email to the instructor, providing the problem and a reason for why you believe it should be regraded. Your entire document may then be regraded and, in case necessary, your original mark raised or lowered. Keep in mind that if a problem has been graded consistently for all students, it is unlikely that changes for a particular student can be made as this would make grading unfair towards the other students.</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>The importance of practice: </strong>Being a mathematician (in the wider sense; you could be a probabilist, statistician, financial analyst, actuarial scientist etc.) is, to a large degree, not different from being a mechanic. A mechanic encounters a problem, analyzes it, and fixes it with the tools from her/his toolbox. Mathematics is the same, just our ‘tools’ are results we have previously derived or learned about: Our hammer is the Central Limit Theorem, our screwdriver the Strong Law of Large Numbers, our drilling machine is Monte Carlo simulation etc. . . . you get the idea. The computer we use to simulate a result is also one of our tools. Now the whole goal is to fill up your toolbox. If you then encounter a new problem, you analyze it, open your toolbox, see what tools you have and apply what works best – just as a mechanic. But if you open your toolbox and there are only few tools in there, you don’t have many options. . . that’s why we work on filling that toolbox in the course, and the practice questions are simply the ‘problems’ you may encounter. And to become a good mechanic, you need a good toolbox plus practice in using it (doesn’t help if you have a thousand tools with you but you don’t know how to use any of them. . . ).</p><p>Thus, work on the practice problems! If you don’t try them and wait for the solution to be presented in class, you look at it and say ‘okay, that sounds reasonable, I would have probably come up with the same idea’. But then you forget about that idea because it didn’t take you any effort to understand. On the other hand, if you tried to find a solution by yourself, you will always remember that point where you got stuck and which was challenging for you. And once you see the solution, you have this aha-effect saying ‘aha, I see, this is what I was missing’. Because of this effect, you will remember that idea/trick in the future, in particular also in an exam. So do try the practice problems alone (if it helps you, set a time limit before starting to ask others). Also, obviously, do look at the solutions after being made available to make sure you learn the underlying ideas and tricks how to approach the problems.</p><p><strong>INC policy: </strong>A grade of INC is awarded to a student who has done course work during the term well enough that they could reasonably be expected to earn a passing mark in the course, but, was unable to complete end-of-term course requirements (usually the final exam) for reasons beyond their control. It is at the instructor's discretion wether a student is eligible for an INC. If a student is not passing the class going into the final exam, it is unlikely that they will be granted an INC. See https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/incomplete-procedure.</p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
