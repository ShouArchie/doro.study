<p>This course covers a wide range of topics pertaining to the statistical analysis of data from prospective studies. The major areas of coverage are i) methods for the analysis of longitudinal data arising from repeated measurements of individuals and ii) the analysis of life history data. For longitudinal data, likelihood-based methods will be covered based on hierarchical mixed effect models and transitional models. Robust marginal models will also be covered with inferences based on estimating equations. Continuous and discrete outcomes will be treated. The material on event history analysis will primarily involve an introduction to the analysis of survival data with some introduction to the modeling of censoring, truncation and more complex sampling processes. Studies will be discussed from the epidemiological literature and other sources in the public domain. Data analysis will be carried out using statistical software (e.g. R).</p><h3>Course Information Webpage</h3><p>The <strong>course webpage </strong>is available through <a href="http://learn.uwaterloo.ca/"><u>http://learn.uwaterloo.ca</u></a> for the purpose of distributing all course materials and announcements. Critical course instructions will be communicated by announcements so you are expected to regularly visit the course webpage. Please review your email and notification settings.<strong> </strong>I recommend you subscribe to notifications related to Announcements so you don’t miss any important information.</p><h3>Pre-requisites for STAT 437</h3><p>To take this course you need to have taken STAT 431. This course will rely heavily on material from STAT 331 and STAT 431. I will provide a review of this material in an attempt to keep it self-contained, but the review will be fairly brief and will assume some familiarity.</p><h3>Piazza</h3><p>To facilitate discussions during this course, a <strong>class discussion board</strong> at <a href="https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/stat437">https://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2025/stat437</a> will be used. Please only <strong>post</strong> about the <strong>course content</strong>. This includes questions on the lectures, course slides, assessments, R code, etc. For questions related to general <strong>course logistics</strong>, please use the <strong>pinned post [General Questions and Course Logistics]. </strong>Please do not send these questions via email. More detailed rules for posting on Piazza (e.g., naming convention to title your post) are pinned on the top on Piazza. Students are encouraged to respond to questions and help each other. I expect everyone to be respectful to each other, any posts that do not meet the principles in <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33">Policy 33: Ethical Behaviour</a> will be removed.</p><p>Response time: You can expect a response within approximately 24-48 hours during the week. Piazza will not be monitored in the evenings or on weekends.</p><h3>Email</h3><p>If you have private questions unrelated to the course content and logistics and of a personal nature, please feel free to email your instructor directly. Please send your emails from your uwaterloo.ca email address and include your student ID number. </p><h4>Continuity Plans</h4><p>In response to decisions affecting the entire University, if in-person lectures are canceled (short-term or long-term), they will be replaced by virtual lectures on Zoom during the scheduled lecture time; if in-person office hours are not possible, virtual official hours will be held through Zoom meetings; if a proctored in-person midterm test is not possible, they will be held online using Crowdmark.</p><p>If the instructor must not attend campus following University's <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/health-and-safety">Health and Safe</a> guidelines, a TA may replace the instructor and deliver the lecture using instructor-provided teaching material.</p>

<h3>R Statistical Software</h3><p>The course notes and lectures use the R statistical programming language for all examples. This is the only software that the instructor and TAs will answer specific programming questions about. You can download R and the RStudio development environment from <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">here</a>. R is commonly used in STAT 231 and other third-year courses. If you are not familiar with R programming or syntax, the book <i>Introductory Statistics with R</i> by Dalgaard is a helpful resource for you.</p>

Within each document, please clearly mark the part (a, b, c...) to which each answer corresponds. You can resubmit your assignment as many times as you like before the deadline.  It is your responsibility to make sure your solution to each question is submitted in the correct section, that the pages are rotated correctly, and that your solutions are visually clear (if your answers cannot be read you will receive a grade of zero). Assignments that are left as a single document, not uploaded to the appropriate places, or not rotated correctly in Crowdmark will be assigned a 10% penalty. <i><strong>Be sure to give yourself ample time to upload your solutions before the deadline.</strong></i><br/> </li><li><strong>Late Assignments:</strong> You lose 5% per hour late. The solution will be posted on LEARN at 8:00 am on the day after the due date. No late submission will be accepted after the solution is posted. It will be considered as a missed assignment. <br/> </li><li><strong>Missed Assignments: </strong>If you <strong>miss an assignment </strong>with<strong> </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/absence-declarations"><u>Absence Declarations</u></a>, you will score a 0 for that assignment, the weight of a missed assignment will be shifted to the next test (either Midterm Test 1 or Midterm Test 2).<br/> </li><li><strong>Retrieving Marked Assignments:</strong> A link to your graded assignment will be sent to you via email.<br/> </li><li><strong>Rules for Collaboration: </strong>Students are encouraged to discuss assignment exercises with each other, the TAs, and the course instructor. Any assistance must be limited to discussion of the problem and sketching general approaches to a solution. Each student must write their own solutions, including code (where relevant). Consulting another student’s solution is prohibited, and submitted solutions may not be copied from any source. In particular, submitting solutions copied in whole or in part from an assignment submission or solution key from a previous offering of this course, or from an offering of any other course, is forbidden, even if a student is resubmitting their own work. These and any other forms of collaboration on assignments constitute cheating. Suspected cases of cheating will be immediately forwarded to the Associate Dean. If you have any questions about whether some activity constitutes cheating, please ask the instructor.</li></ul><h3>Midterm Policies</h3><p>Midterm Tests 1 and 2 are held during the lecture time (1:00 PM - 2:20 PM) on <strong>February 12 and March 26</strong>, respectively, in <strong>RCH 208 and RCH 212.</strong></p><p>If you <strong>miss one midterm test </strong>with<strong> </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/absence-declarations"><u>Absence Declarations</u></a>, you will score a 0 for that test, and <strong>the weight will be automatically transferred to the final project</strong>.</p><p> </p>

Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
