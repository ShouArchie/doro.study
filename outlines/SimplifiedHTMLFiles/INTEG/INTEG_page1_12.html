<p>(NOTE: Most text in this section is copied from INTEG 420A; bolded language at the end of this section is the focus of INTEG 420B.) </p><p>The Senior Honours Project is the two-term culmination of the Knowledge Integration degree. It provides students with the opportunity to engage in an original inquiry process through either a design project, creative project, or academic thesis, honing your KI skills while opening options for your next career move. The capstone project should demonstrate the ability to undertake integrative inquiry that addresses a topic drawn from the student’s area(s) of interest, while building a relationship with a mentor whose expertise can support the student’s chosen topic. Class meetings will be devoted to discussion, workshops, and mini-presentations to support your inquiry process as you move from topic selection, to finding an appropriate mentor, to developing your project pitch/proposal, onto carrying out in INTEG 420B the project design, implementation and write up. While the course instructor will facilitate these meetings, set out the deliverables for making progress on the project, and be available to answer student questions, a big part of the success of your project is building a strong community of support around your work, including a peer group, your work with a mentor(s) and seeking out additional training, communities, or networks that can guide you. Implementing and developing mechanisms for personal accountability introduced in the course will also contribute to success. </p><p>In INTEG 420A (typically taken in the Fall term of a student’s final year of the BKI), students will focus on specifying and designing their capstone project, initiating a methodical inquiry process (including obtaining ethics approval where necessary, which usually takes several weeks), and situating the project in a context of past and current relevant work (i.e., conducting an appropriate literature review). Students will also be learning about their own work habits and how to work productively and iteratively towards achieving the goals of their project. In INTEG 420B (typically taken during the term immediately following INTEG 420A), students will complete their project and prepare a flash talk, short conference paper, and poster for the KI symposium in March, and organize the write up of their final paper due in April. Along with such project deliverables, students will include a reflection on how they met learning objectives listed below.</p><p>(NOTE: students registered for a different thesis course, e.g., PSYCH 499, are still required to participate in the KI Symposium and to complete the conference paper and poster in order to receive credit towards INTEG 420A/B. They are encouraged to join a peer group in INTEG 420A/B as well.) </p><p>The thinking processes that you will apply in INTEG 420A focus on divergent thinking in preparation for the work of INTEG 420B (<strong>convergent thinking</strong>). Appropriate activities in INTEG 420A include exploring (and revising) possible questions and early prototypes as applicable. <strong>In INTEG 420B, students will make final decisions to focus on project implementation.</strong></p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Class Meetings &amp; Peer Groups in INTEG 420B</strong></p><p>This course is scheduled to meet twice every week. Please talk to me if your schedule does not fit with our meeting times, and I will do my best to work out an appropriate accommodation with you. Now that we are in the second half of a capstone course, you have one term remaining to complete your project. Thus you should focus on following through on the project proposed at the end of 420A and on producing a finished product by the end of term, including project writeup. </p><p><i><strong>A capstone project is about showing people what you can do.</strong></i> This means that <u>you</u> are in the driver’s seat and primarily responsible for your own learning, design thinking, project planning, and project activity. Similar to driver’s education, the student drives, but the instructor helps with technique and ensuring the car doesn’t crash. In this course, the Instructor and mentors (i.e., supervisor or mentor) provide feedback and advice that they believe may be helpful for the student and the development of their project. </p><p>The first week of term will use scheduled time to establish norms for the remainder of class meetings. We will discuss how course activities relate to final assessment. As needed, topics covered in INTEG 420A may be reviewed, such as how to develop what is often called a "research interest", how to identify a potential mentor, and how to approach and engage with them professionally. Flipped skill-building activities will focus on discussing your progress with research/report writing, writing an abstract, designing a poster, and crafting a flash talk. A list of relevant topics is below. </p><ul><li>Course expectations</li><li>Writing a zeroth-order draft</li><li>Soliciting feedback early and often</li><li>Revising your work</li><li>Psychological factors that block productivity and how to work around them</li></ul><p>As was the case last term, <u>you are encouraged to form peer support/writing groups</u>. How you structure and run the group will be up to you and your group members. As needed, I may provide you with some suggestions as to how you might best make use of your time together. Most class meetings will be work time, and the KI studio is an appropriate place for groups to meet. Students who work better in quiet settings individually may opt to work during class time from the library or home with the exception of <strong>March 3</strong> and <strong>March 23</strong>, which have scheduled in-person class activities (see table below). </p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Week</strong></td><td><strong>Topic/Activity</strong></td><td><strong>Assigned</strong></td><td><strong>Due</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>WK1: </p><p>Jan 6-11</p></td><td><ul><li>Jan 6<ul><li>Course outline</li><li>Revisiting the meaning of research/inquiry</li></ul></li><li>Jan 8<ul><li>Scrum lite (standups) for generating/ maintaining momentum</li><li>Share/work on storyboards in small groups</li></ul></li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Weekly check-in/standup</li><li>RECOMMENDED: Email check-in/update to your mentor</li><li>RECOMMENDED: Writing and Communication Centre Workshops<ul><li>“Getting It Done” or</li><li>“Rock Your Thesis”</li></ul></li></ul></td><td><ul><li>IF APPLICABLE: Early storyboard and rough workplan (in LEARN, Jan 11, 11:59 PM)</li><li>RECOMMENDED: Email check-in/update to your mentor</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>WK2: </p><p>Jan 12-18</p></td><td rowspan="5">Follow your own work plan</td><td rowspan="3">Weekly check-in/standup</td><td><p>Weekly Check-in/Standup 1 (Mon, first 15 min. of class)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>WK3: </p><p>Jan 19-25</p></td><td><p>Weekly Check-in/Standup 2 (Mon, first 15 min. of class)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>WK4: </p><p>Jan 26 – Feb 1</p></td><td><ul><li>Weekly Check-in/Standup 3 (Mon)</li><li>IF APPLICABLE: Rough literature review (in LEARN, Feb 1, 11:59 PM)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>WK5: </p><p>Feb 2-8</p></td><td><ul><li>Weekly standup</li><li>Draft abstract</li><li>RECOMMENDED: “Designing Academic Posters” Writing and Communication Centre Workshop</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Weekly Check-in/Standup 4 (Mon)</li><li>Draft abstract (in LEARN, Feb 8, 11:59 PM)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>WK6: </p><p>Feb 9-15</p></td><td><ul><li>Weekly standup</li><li>Draft poster</li></ul></td><td><p>Weekly Check-in/Standup 5 (Mon, first 15 min. of class)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>READING WEEK: </p><p>Feb 13-23</p></td><td>No class meetings</td><td><ul><li>Prep draft poster</li><li>Prep weekly standup 6</li><li>INTEG 420 project info form</li></ul></td><td>No assignments due</td></tr><tr><td><p>WK7: </p><p>Feb 24 – Mar 1</p></td><td><ul><li>Follow your own work plan</li><li>Feb 26: Class time to finalize abstract</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Weekly standup</li><li>Prep draft poster</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Weekly Check-in/Standup 6 (Mon)</li><li>420 info form (Feb 26, 11:59 PM)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>WK8: </p><p>Mar 2-8</p></td><td colspan="2"><p>Mar 3 class activity: Draft poster feedback session</p><p>Mar 5: Revise poster, work time</p></td><td>Draft poster (Mar 3 in class and LEARN d-board) </td></tr><tr><td><p>WK9: </p><p>Mar 9-15</p></td><td><ul><li>Follow your own work plan</li><li>Print poster this week</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Weekly standup</li><li>REMINDER: Symposium next week (install poster, deliver flash talk)</li></ul></td><td>Weekly Check-in/Standup 7 (Mon)</td></tr><tr><td><p>WK10: </p><p>Mar 16-22</p></td><td><ul><li>Mar 16: Poster/display install</li><li>Follow your own work plan</li><li>Mar 17: Discussion of flash talk / elevator pitch delivery</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Weekly standup</li><li>REMINDER: Digital copy of poster in LEARN</li><li>IF APPLICABLE: Declare weightings for KI Symposium deliverables,</li><li>REMINDER: Symposium Friday</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Mar 16: Poster/display install</li><li>Mar 17: Digital copy of poster in LEARN (end of class)</li><li>Mar 21<ul><li>IF APPLICABLE: Flash talk slide in LEARN (12:00 PM)</li><li>Symposium (setup 2:15 PM)</li></ul></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>WK11: </p><p>Mar 23-29</p></td><td><ul><li>Follow your own work plan</li><li>Mar 23 class activity: Symposium and course debrief, course evaluation</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Weekly standup</li><li>Learning reflection</li></ul></td><td><p>Weekly Check-in/Standup 9 (Mon)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>WK12: </p><p>Mar 30 – Apr 5</p></td><td><p>Follow your own work plan</p></td><td><p>Weekly standup</p></td><td><ul><li>Weekly Check-in/Standup 10 (Mon)</li><li>Learning reflection (in LEARN, Apr 5, 11:59 PM)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Apr 7-8</td><td colspan="3"><p>Pre-examination study days, no assignments due</p></td></tr><tr><td>Apr 9*</td><td colspan="3"><p>Final Write-up and/or Display by Apr 9*, 11:59 PM</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">*Unless an alternative date is requested by a mentor (e.g., due to a conflict with their exam schedule), or the due date conflicts with a scheduled final exam for the student, all students should submit their final INTEG 420B deliverable(s) by the start of the exam period. </td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p> </p>

<p>Instructions and resources for all assignments will be made available in LEARN. </p><p><strong>Assessment in 420A and its contribution to the final grade posted on your transcript upon completion of 420B: </strong>INTEG 420A was the first of a two-part sequence. University policy for a course like 420A is that all students receive an IP at the end of term. Thus student assessments in 420A served as <i>indicators </i>for the strength of a student's <i>work in progress</i> as well as how much progress the student made over the first part of the sequence. Due to differences in the working styles of students, the quality (and quantity) of work-in-progress during 420A may not necessarily be representative of work completed by the end of 420B. Thus the quality of deliverables at the end of 420B and evidence of steady progress (i.e., participation marks for 420B) will determine the mark recorded for INTEG 420B. University policy is that the mark recorded for 420B will also be recorded for 420A on the student's transcript.</p><p><strong>Acceptable rules for coauthored work: </strong>Occasionally, two students opt to do their Senior Honours Project together as co-contributors. Such projects will be recognized as the result of a collaboration, meaning that each deliverable (namely annotated bibliography, literature review, story board and work plan) should be a single, consistent, coherent submission for both students. The submission should reflect the collaboration as a whole, not the monumental efforts of one student. More coordination and cooperation may be involved for coauthored work, and it may involve diplomatically encouraging one partner to step up or to step back.</p><p>Most of the time, individual marks for coauthored work will be the same, based on an overall (or average) mark for the deliverable. However, disclosures for what contributions each co-author spearheaded (if the co-authors did not contribute equally) can be helpful for assigning differentiated individual marks if appropriate. See the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/authorship">Author Contributions guidelines</a> from the Journal <i>PLOS ONE </i>as an example and speak with the instructor if there are questions.</p><p>In the event that a student appears to be abusing the collaborative efforts of their partner (i.e., free riding), their individual mark on a co-authored deliverable may be replaced with a mark of 62 (C-) or lower. <i><strong>Severe problems of this nature in a collaboration that the students are unable to resolve on their own should be brought to the attention of the instructor.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Late submissions of assignments: </strong>The University has adopted a short-term absence policy for up to 2 days (see Administrative Policy below). In addition to University policy, all students in INTEG 420B may apply up to 2 additional "Grace Days” to late 420B deliverables without penalty. Grace Days may be applied to most 420B assignments except those marked with a circumflex (^).</p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Use of Generative AI</strong></p><ul><li>Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT or DALL-E can serve as additional sounding boards for your thoughts.</li><li>However, these tools are imperfect and should not be blindly trusted.</li><li>These tools can be ethically problematic.</li><li>Like any other external resource you might use in producing your work, your use of them must be properly acknowledged otherwise you could be guilty of an academic integrity violation. (See University Policy below for further information about academic integrity.)</li><li>Like any work you submit based in part on external resources, you should expect your grade to reflect the amount of original content and thought in your submission. If you submit work that is entirely assembled from external sources without original thought (even if sources are properly cited), then you are not guilty of plagiarism but you might appropriately expect to receive a low grade for being derivative (as opposed to innovative and insightful).</li><li>In this course, any work you submit that is based in part on generative AI must include a cover paragraph explaining when you used GenAI as a tool, what it contributed to your work, and what you did with the information it provided. Use must also be appropriately cited.</li></ul><p><strong>Research Ethics:</strong> The University of Waterloo requires all research conducted by its students, staff, and faculty which involves humans as participants to undergo prior ethics review and clearance through the Director, Office of Human Research and Animal Care (Office). The ethics review and clearance processes are intended to ensure that projects comply with the Office’s Guidelines for Research with Human Participants (Guidelines) as well as those of provincial and federal agencies, and that the safety, rights and welfare of participants are adequately protected. The Guidelines inform researchers about ethical issues and procedures which are of concern when conducting research with humans (e.g. confidentiality, risks and benefits, informed consent process, etc.). If the development of your research proposal consists of research that involves humans as participants, the please contact the course instructor for guidance and see: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics</u></a>. Note that user research for design projects are categorized by the Office of Research as “<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics/research-human-participants/pre-submission-and-training/human-research-guidelines-policies-and-resources/definition-professional-skill-development">entrepreneurial activities</a>” and do not require ethics review.</p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
