<div>INTEG 321:</div>
<p>An introduction to the museum, broadly interpreted as the public face of scholarship. Students construct and exhibit their designs from INTEG320, and present public talks on the scholarship and curatorial decisions behind their work.</p>

<p>INTEG 321 is a 12-week, half-credit course that is part of the core program for Knowledge Integration students. It is the second half of “The Museum Course”, coming after INTEG 320, in which students apply their skills and experience to a major collaborative interdisciplinary project: the design of a museum exhibit.  Over the course of the 24 weeks of INTEG 320/321, you will collaborate within your groups to research, design, build, and present a museum exhibit that uses objects, text and experiences to help achieve those learning objectives. Roughly speaking, INTEG 320 comprises the project definition, research, conceptual design, and early prototyping phases of the project. Time in INTEG321 is spent critiquing, refining, redesigning, and fabricating the exhibits for public exhibition in March.</p><p>In INTEG320, your design groups chose a topic and associated learning objectives: what do you want your visitors to experience, feel, learn..  You researched and designed aspects of the visitor experience, and developed a storyboard detailing the experience of visiting your exhibit.  In INTEG321, you will implement your design: refine, iterate, build, and present your exhibit. </p><p>The primary audience for the design is high-school and university students. However, the exhibit will be open to the entire Waterloo community including adults and children: faculty, staff, parents, siblings, and community members. You will want to consider the points of view of different segments of this audience in your design.</p>

  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Increase your domain-specific knowledge about your specific topic area and, in the process, gain experience and increased comfort doing independent research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gain experience identifying, understanding and addressing the issues that may arise during a complex, extended group project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exercise your time management, organizational, negotiation, leadership, followership and other professional skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gain experience planning a large project, including: breaking large tasks into components, scheduling and distributing tasks, adjusting scope in light of constraints.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Experience the satisfaction of making your ideas come to life in something physical, and the pleasure of watching how that thing creates an impact on others.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p role="note">The Museum Course provides a context in which students gain experience applying their skills in research, communication, collaboration, and design. The obvious end product is the museum exhibit, but perhaps more important is the development of collaboration and other professional skills that accompany the creation of that exhibit. While the exhibit you build may have an impact on your hundreds of visitors, the most important aspect is the growth and impact that activity will have on you, the student.</p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>INTEG321 is primarily a studio-type course: your main objective is to build your exhibits, and the teaching team's objective is to support you in whatever way that we can with advice and information on project management, scoping, design, construction, and other aspects. The term will be roughly divided into three periods: the first three weeks, the next five weeks, and the remaining four weeks.</p><ul><li>During the first three weeks you will finish any door preparation and begin building the infrastructure for your exhibit. You will continue to develop and update your implementation plan--your roadmap to getting the exhibit built.</li><li>The next five weeks are build, build, build. The start of the classroom period will be used for whole-group updates and announcements. Most of the classroom period will be freed up to give you additional common time to work together. <strong>Use the first 15-20 minutes of those meetings to review recent progress, discuss group issues, get on the same page about upcoming milestones, and update your project plans. </strong></li><li>The last four weeks are the installation, exhibition, strike, and course wrap-up.</li></ul><p>A slightly more detailed schedule can be found, and may be periodically updated as needed, <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=1055896&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=uWaterloo-3009791">here</a>.</p>

<p>Deliverables listed above have detailed descriptions, grading information, and submission details <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/le/content/943012/viewContent/5082013/View">here</a>.</p><h2><strong>Grading</strong></h2><p>INTEG321 has several deliverables, some of which are individually graded and some, including the exhibit itself, which are group graded.  The default is that all members of a group will receive the same grade for group-graded deliverables, though there is a mechanism for differential grading should any member of the group feel that is justified.  <strong>In some cases, groups may in fact acknowledge and plan for this as described in the next section; it's a good idea to have that conversation early.</strong></p><p>Student(s) requesting differential grading must request it by email within 3 days of submission, with a simple email that says "I would like to request differential grading be considered for the latest assignment."  More detail is not necessary, since I will email each group member to request further info, including the requestor.  I will base my decision and any grade adjustments on the resulting input, and on the peer feedback available at the time. </p><p>The 2025 deadlines to request differential grading are:</p><ul><li>for the implementation plan (D10), Jan 27 plus any grace days used;</li><li>for the actual exhibit (D11), Mar 20 (grace days cannot be used for the exhibit).</li></ul><p><strong>If the request is based on long-standing issues and there is no evidence the group has made real attempts to resolve those issues, I am unlikely to alter any grades.  Essentially: the fact that differential grading is being considered should never come as a surprise to anyone in the group, and it isn't a crutch to be used to avoid dealing with group issues.</strong></p><h3><strong>Differential Grading and the Real World</strong></h3><p>Differential grading--and discussing unequal effort in a group in general--can be a source of conflict or a source of relief, depending how and when a group discusses the prospect. Many groups will avoid discussing this altogether, partly because people measure their worth extrinsically--by the credit they get from others--and to suggest differential grading implies that one person is somehow lesser. But these conversations about credit and recognition will be absolutely critical in all your future collaborations!  So gaining experience having candid conversations about credit and effort is incredibly valuable.</p><p>Having said that, differential grading is also an opportunity to recognize from the start that some group members may not be willing or able to contribute the way others expect, for any variety of reasons (e.g., part-time jobs, higher or lower course loads, different expertise/interest, etc.). Having those conversations up front can alleviate feelings of guilt and resentment that arise from an imbalance of work that isn’t openly discussed. If there's a significant imbalance in a long project, it will end up being discussed at some point and everyone is better off if that happens early.</p><p>If groups are having difficulty thinking about how to have a conversation about differential grading, I'm happy to help.</p><h3><strong>Late submissions</strong></h3><p>Each individual will be allocated a total of 4 grace days, which allow deliverables to be handed in late without penalty. Grace days used for group deliverables will be subtracted from EACH member of the group. Late days, including weekends, will be tracked individually. At the end of the term, I will total the number of late days, subtract 4, and each student will receive a 1% penalty on their overall grade for each late day beyond the 4 grace days. Note that grace days cannot be used for the exhibit, D11.</p><h2><strong>Group Work</strong></h2><p>The nature of The Museum Course requires significant, extended group work, in a way that you may not have experienced to date.  Even compared to INTEG320, the nature of group work changes in INTEG321.  With the majority of your major decisions already made, groups tend to work more independently on parallel assigned tasks as things move from more conceptual to getting-it-done.  <strong>This means that delegation is important and accountability and communication are critical.</strong></p><p>You will undoubtedly encounter conflict, but not all conflict is bad! Groups are highly encouraged to engage in regular reflection about their process and give each other formative feedback at regular intervals. While groups are expected to openly discuss and resolve any issues that arise—indeed, a significant part of the experiential learning is in doing so—the instructor is available to act as an advisor or facilitator if any group member desires.</p><h2><strong>Exhibition Planning Committee</strong></h2><p>In order to help plan the exhibition, we will form an Exhibition Planning Committee, which will consider exhibition-wide issues such as how to get the word out, what kind of closing party we want to have, how to ensure safety protocols are followed, documentation of the process and exhibits, design of posters/invitations, etc. All these things are important for the exhibition--and therefore your exhibits--to be successful.  Ideally, the committee will include at least one person from each group with an interest in organization/documentation/publicity/graphic design/marketing.  Participation in "ExCom" will contribute towards your Course Engagement grade (for other ways to engage, see the <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=1055896&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=uWaterloo-4204370">full description</a>).</p>
