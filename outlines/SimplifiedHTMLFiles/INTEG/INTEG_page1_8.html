<p>This course examines social aspects of knowledge, including ways that characteristics of individual knowers and their communities affect the acquisition, interpretation, production, and transfer of knowledge.  In addition, we analyze the consequences this has for the objectivity of knowledge.  The course features significant input from researchers in the humanities and social sciences in the form of guest lectures.</p>

<h2>Course Description</h2><p>This is a course about <strong>diverse ways of knowing</strong>. We’ll examine the nature of knowledge by studying some of the theory behind it (called “epistemology”). Traditional theories of knowledge have focused on individuals as the producers of knowledge, while ignoring the identity of those individuals (e.g., their gender, race, or cultural background), as they were believed to be irrelevant to understanding the nature of knowledge. Two fields have created alternatives to this view: <strong>feminist epistemology</strong> and <strong>social epistemology</strong>. Feminist epistemologists argue that a person’s social identity <i>is</i>epistemologically relevant. They say that all knowledge is “situated knowledge” where someone’s characteristics and experiences provide a lens through which they view the world. Social epistemologists argue against the traditional idea that knowledge is produced by individuals. They claim that most of our knowledge is created and transmitted through social processes, and that we should pay attention to how these processes work to understand the nature of knowledge. We will look at some of the key work in these two fields, and students will have the opportunity to apply what they are learning both to themselves and to real-world issues.</p>

<h2>Required Assignments: What Will I Need to Do?</h2><h2>Course Engagement</h2><p>Active engagement is a crucial part of this course. We will take a philosophical approach to examining diverse ways of knowing. Just as many scientific fields require hands-on laboratory practice for deep learning, doing philosophy also requires practice. This involves <strong>actively engaging with texts</strong> (e.g., identifying an author’s thesis, uncovering the structure of an argument, or raising objections to an argument), as well as <strong>participating in thoughtful dialogue with others</strong>. Course engagement is also important for creating a collaborative learning community where we can all learn from one another. </p><p>A significant portion of your course grade will be based on your engagement with course material, with other students, and with the instructor. This includes (1) assigned readings/videos on Perusall, and (2) your choice of engagement activities. Anyone should be able to get a high mark on engagement with enough time and effort!</p><h3>Assigned Readings/Videos on Perusall (15%)</h3><ul><li>This part of your grade will be based on <strong>completing assigned readings on Perusall</strong>. Completion means doing the reading and annotating the text (i.e., highlighting text and adding comments or questions, or replying to others’ comments or questions) by the due date on LEARN.</li><li>It is important that you do the assigned readings on time as most of the class sessions will focus on the specific reading assigned for that day.</li></ul><h3>Your Choice of Course Engagement Activities (15%)</h3><ul><li>In addition to the readings, you will be expected to complete <strong>your choice of engagement activities that contribute to a collaborative learning environment</strong>. Activities might include posts or replies in LEARN Discussion Forums, contributing to collaborative class notes, participating in class discussions, doing an optional reading and posting a short reflection on LEARN, sharing how you’ve applied course material (e.g., in another course or in conversation with a friend or family member), or something else!</li><li>You are also expected to attend class on a regular basis. You can miss up to <u>two</u> class sessions for any reason without it negatively affecting your Course Engagement grade. If you miss additional classes due to illness, be sure to declare them on Quest (see the Absence Policy below for more information).</li><li>At the end of the course, you will be asked to<strong> write a summary &amp; reflection </strong>on how you contributed to the learning community and suggest a <u>grade range</u> that you think best reflects the work you did.</li></ul><h3>“Who Am I as a Knower” Assignment (15%)</h3><p>For this assignment, you will have the opportunity to apply the concept of situated knowledge to yourself to reflect on who <i>you</i> are as a knower. There are three main things you need to do: (1) explain the concept of situated knowledge and how it differs from traditional theories of knowledge, (2) apply the concept to yourself by expressing various characteristics that you think are epistemically relevant, (3) discuss cases in which these characteristics affect what you know, how you know it, or how your knowledge is received by others.  </p><h3>Midterm Learning Portfolio (15%)</h3><p>The midterm portfolio has three parts. In part one, you will choose one of the major theories we have discussed so far – standpoint theory, feminist empiricism, or black feminist epistemology – and write a short, critical reflection that summarizes the theory, along with your analysis of it. In part two, you will communicate a key aspect of reflection through a creative medium (such as an infographic). Finally, in part three, you should write a brief check-in about your course engagement thus far, including your goals for the second half of the course. </p><h3>Final Learning Portfolio (20%) </h3><p>At the end of the course, you will create a learning portfolio that documents your development in this course as a learner, knower, collaborator, and/or aspiring ally, and how you will apply what you’ve learned in this course to other contexts. You must draw on at least one concept, theory, or framework from the course (e.g., situated knowledge, standpoint theory, epistemology of ignorance) to inform your reflection. Note that there is no final exam in this course, so the Learning Reflection is your capstone assignment.</p><h3>Group Project (20%)</h3><p>You will have one group project in this course. Each group will be asked to research and present one real-world example or issue related to epistemic injustice or epistemology of ignorance, along with ideas as to how the injustice or ignorance can be combatted.</p><ul><li>Your group should submit a draft of your project by the date listed above (and on LEARN). You will also be asked to look at other groups’ draft projects and provide constructive feedback.</li><li>Each group will then have an opportunity to incorporate feedback on their projects and revise their projects before the final due date (listed above and on LEARN).</li><li>After the project has been submitted, each student will fill out a peer evaluation of each of their group members, including themselves.</li></ul><h2>Late Policy &amp; Grace Days</h2><p>Assignments are <strong>due by 11:59pm</strong> on the dates listed above. You must submit your work to the appropriate dropbox on LEARN. If you have technical problems submitting your work, please <strong>email me immediately and attach</strong> your assignment before the deadline to avoid late penalties.</p><ul><li>Each student will be automatically given a total of <strong><u>4 grace days</u></strong> for submitting late work (excluding the group project). Grace days can all be used for one assignment or broken up over several assignments.</li><li>After the grace days are applied, there will be a <strong>5-point penalty</strong> for each day or part of a day an assignment is late, including weekends.</li><li><strong>You</strong> <strong>do not need to inform me when you use a grace day</strong>. I will track late days throughout the term and apply them after the final assignment is in. I will first apply grace days to the late assignments that are weighted most heavily in the overall course grade; if you have more than three late days, I will then apply the 5-point late penalty for each additional day an assignment was late.</li><li>Because of these grace days, <strong>no other extensions will be given,</strong> except when an accommodation is warranted (see below).</li><li><u>All</u> course work must be submitted no later than Monday, April 14, at 10pm.</li></ul><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
