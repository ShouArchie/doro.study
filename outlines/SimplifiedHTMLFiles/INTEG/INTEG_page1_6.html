<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>INTEG 230:</div>

<div>
<p>INTEG 230 builds on the Observation and Design Skills introduced in INTEG 121, and adds domain-specific knowledge about museums and learning in order to prepare you for your Field Trip – whatever form it takes. You’re building relationships with the people you’ll travel with, learn with, and eventually create an exhibit with in INTEG 320 and 321. We’ll lay the groundwork, but expect you to shoulder the responsibility for your – and others’ – success.</p><p>Information regarding the Field Trip that follows this course can be found on the <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/home/359233">LEARN Field Trip community site</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Assignment submission / due dates</strong></h3><p>Please see detailed information about assignments and due dates in the <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/le/content/1102776/Home?itemIdentifier=D2L.LE.Content.ContentObject.ModuleCO-5772804">Assignments &amp; Deliverables</a> page on Learn.</p><h3><strong>Late Submissions</strong></h3><p>Each student will be allocated a total of 4 grace days, which allow deliverables to be handed in late without penalty. Grace days used for group deliverables will be subtracted from EACH member of the group. Late days, including weekends, will be tracked individually. At the end of the term, I will total the number of late days, subtract 4, and each student will receive a 1% penalty <strong>on their overall grade</strong> for each late day beyond the 4 grace days. <br/><br/><strong>Grace days cannot be used for the PK slides (D3).  Readings (D1) have their own late mechanism, detailed in the D1 description.</strong></p><h3><strong>Alternate arrangements</strong></h3><p>Students with valid justification may make alternate arrangements with the instructor prior to the due date.</p><h3><strong>Use of Generative AI</strong></h3><p><strong>Note that this is my position, in my course.  Other instructors and courses may vary.</strong></p><ul><li>Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT or DALL-E can provide a great starting point for thoughts.</li><li>These tools are imperfect and should not be blindly trusted.</li><li>These tools can be ethically problematic.</li><li>Like any other external resource you might use in producing your work, your use of them must be properly acknowledged otherwise you could be guilty of a Policy 71 violation.</li><li>Like any work you submit based in part on external resources, you should expect your grade to reflect the amount of original content and thought in your submission.  If you submit work that is entirely assembled from external sources without original thought (even if sources are properly cited), then you are not guilty of plagiarism but you might appropriately expect to receive a low grade.</li><li><strong>In this course, any work you submit that is based in part on generative AI</strong> <strong>must include a cover paragraph explaining when you used GenAI as a tool, what it contributed to your work, and what you did with the information it provided</strong>.  <strong>Use must also be </strong><a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><strong>appropriately cited</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li></ul><p>More resources, from University of Waterloo guidelines, can be found in the Administrative Policy section below.</p><h3><strong>Attendance &amp; Engagement</strong></h3><p>Your attendance &amp; engagement, your positive contributions, and your effective planning and coordination with other members of the travel cohort are important. We care about you and what you think, and we know you have good things to offer the cohort.<br/><br/><i>Sometimes, you can't make it.  </i>In such cases, first and foremost I hope that whatever is keeping you from the classroom resolves quickly and well. <strong> There are still a couple of things you're responsible for though, and they're there to help me, your other profs, and the University accommodate you as best possible:</strong></p><ul><li>please email me to let me know you won't be coming, and</li><li>declare your absence (see the <strong>Illness and other absences requiring academic considerations</strong> section in the Administrative Policy section below, or ask me).</li></ul><p><strong>Attendance and engagement count as part of D2 Course Engagement, and the expectation is that you will be present and engaged at every session.</strong></p><h3><strong>In-class discussion &amp; activities</strong></h3><p>Students are expected to be prepared for thoughtful, relevant, and respectful contributions to class discussions and small-group activities. Absorb the readings; do the exercises; offer input / feedback; engage in the class.</p><h3><strong>Individual vs. Group Work</strong></h3><p>For individual work, discussing assignments can improve your understanding and learning.  However, you must still produce original work from individual effort, maintaining your academic integrity. A simple trick to avoid copying and other academic offenses (in this class and others!): take a one-hour break after your discussions and before writing up the idea. The ideas will come out in your own words, ensuring that you have integrated them – acquired new knowledge – rather than just reproducing the discussion.</p>

For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).<br/><br/>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.<br/><br/>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
