<p>Each class meeting is two hours in length (Mon and Wed from 2:30 PM - 4:20 PM). Class meetings will have interactive learning activities or time to work with group members on assigned Projects. According to the UW Undergraduate Studies Calendar, studio time includes "teaching [consisting] of instructor coaching focused on practical skills execution, normally in a room with special purpose equipment, such as audio-visual recording equipment, theatre technical equipment, etc."</p><p><strong>Collaboration</strong> is essential for solving complex, real-world problems. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, the ability to work well in a team is becoming one of the most sought-after skills by employers. Most students have the opportunity to work in groups, but many have not learned <i>theory </i>behind group work or <i>best practices </i>for making collaboration work. In this course, you will learn and apply key collaborative theories and practices. For example: What aspects of teams are most important? What problems do teams most commonly face and how can those problems be minimized? How can <u>productive</u> conflict increase creativity and productivity, and how can destructive conflict be reduced? </p><p>During the course, you will learn collaboration techniques for improving team dynamics, such as creating and using a team charter, identifying and addressing conflict, providing useful feedback to team members, and building on the ideas of others to arrive at the best outcomes. </p><p><strong>Design thinking</strong> is contrasted with linear thinking, a common approach for solving problems that are simple. Why is "design" in the name? Design is more than making things, or making things pretty; design is about making things <i>better</i>. Ultimately, the target audiences (i.e., users) of anything designed (e.g., a community program, public policy, new product) will be the judge of whether the design makes their lives better.</p><p>During the course, you will also learn some fundamentals of design thinking that will help you work in a team to address a real-world problem. You will be introduced to and will practice techniques for centring <i>the user</i> in your designs as well as becoming cognizant of problem-solving and decision-making stages – both individually and within a team. </p><p>Collaboration and design thinking will be exercised and studied through multiple group-based, real-world projects culminating in an open-ended design challenge and skills-based portfolio. Throughout the course, you will have a chance to reflect on your own strengths and weaknesses in team settings and use feedback from your peers to improve your collaborative skills. You will also receive feedback on the group projects themselves before revising and submitting your best work. Students should come out of this course feeling more comfortable working in groups, more confident in their ability to identify and address problems whether working individually or on a team, and better able to provide useful feedback to others. </p>

<h3>Course Philosophy: Active Learning and Blended Components</h3><p>This course follows an "active learning" philosophy, where the best way to learn collaboration is through trying out best practices. Significant class time will go to building rapport with group members (as well as others in the class, since they might be your group members later in the term!), tutorials on the best practices and techniques of functional groups, group time, and reflection with your group members as well as the whole class. Additionally, 35% of course components (i.e., Group 1 and Group 2 experiences) are blended, which means that you will have a number of weeks to complete a culminating group assignment. The quality of your group assignments will be higher if you work on them between classes in addition to during class. To get the most of out of class time, it is essential that you <strong>prepare <u>before</u></strong> class, <strong>participate <u>in</u></strong> class, and <strong>practice <u>after</u> </strong>class (i.e., 3P structure). Learning activities following this "3P" structure are summarized in the table below.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Component / Learning assessment</strong></td><td><strong>Learning activities</strong></td><td><strong>Learning outcomes</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>Course engagement </p><p>(individual grade; graded primarily pass/fail)</p></td><td><ul><li>Prep: Course readings</li><li>Prep/participate/practice: A/synchronous discussion</li><li>Participate (in class): Practice/technique observations/tutorials</li><li>Prep/participate/practice: Group time</li></ul></td><td>All learning objectives</td></tr><tr><td><p>Sketchbook </p><p>(individual grade; graded primarily pass/fail)</p></td><td>Prep/practice (i.e., before/after class): Complete brief entries every other day according to prompts</td><td><strong>LO1: </strong>Record and share detailed observations of the world around you in order to think critically</td></tr><tr><td><p>Project 1 (blended component)</p><ul><li>PSA Prior Art Observation/Critique (individual grade)</li><li>PSA Project Dossier (group grade)</li><li>PSA Reflection (individual grade)</li></ul></td><td rowspan="2"><ul><li>Participate (in class): Spend time with group members, develop and revise a team charter</li><li>Prep/participate/practice: Think/reflect separately and together as a group about a project</li></ul></td><td rowspan="2"><p><strong>LO2: </strong>Establish and cultivate positive group dynamics by applying appropriate theory and best practices</p><p><strong>LO3:</strong> Take initiative, exercise responsibility, problem solve, and make decisions during crucial stages of a problem-solving cycle</p><p><strong>LO4: </strong>Address pain points in team settings effectively as they arise </p><p><strong>LO5:</strong> Give, receive, and incorporate constructive feedback</p><p><strong>LO6: </strong>Practice collaboration while avoiding excessive delegation to complete a challenging project as a group to your and your group's satisfaction</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Project 2 (blended component)</p><ul><li>ED Prior Art Observation/Critique (individual grade)</li><li>ED Project Dossier (group grade)</li><li>ED Reflection (individual grade)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Personal statement (individual grade)</td><td>A self-directed, culminating component informed by all learning activities throughout the course.

The <strong>course engagement</strong> mark will be affected by how well you prepare for, participate in, and practice regular assigned activities (e.g., course readings, regular observations), class activities, and group work. </p><ul><li><strong>Course readings </strong>will be discussed synchronously in class or asynchronously on LEARN. Your preparation and participation will be indicated by your ability to perform behaviours such as posing thoughtful questions and comments, either in response to the text or to comments/posts from the Instructor or peers. Behaviours will be rated qualitatively as check-plus (exceeds expectations), check (meets expectations), check-minus (below expectations). Further information about expectations will be posted in LEARN.</li><li><strong>Synchronous class discussions and activities </strong>include skill tutorials, group work, and in-class observations. For participation credit, attendance will be taken during most synchronous meetings. For in-class observations, the best two observations over the term count towards the course mark.</li><li><strong>Asynchronous regular observations</strong> are to be practiced and written up in your sketchbook outside of class. For regular observations, the best two sketchbook checks over the term count towards the course mark.</li></ul><p>The mark for the <strong>course engagement </strong>category will be determined through a specifications grading approach to develop a common base of knowledge/experience for all students and to maintain student motivation. Each course engagement activity is graded pass/fail, and the overall course engagement grade will be based on the number of levels completed below <u>cumulatively</u> over the term (i.e., over a total of 12 weeks).  </p><p>Level 1, 70% – Required engagement for the learning community </p><ul><li>Participation during key synchronous learning activities (i.e. 40/40% earned)</li><li>Reading/discussion/observation engagement completed at the “check-minus” level only (i.e. 30/60% earned)</li></ul><p>Level 2, 85% – Level 1 achieved, and: </p><ul><li>Reading/discussion/observation engagement consistently achieves the “check” level by the end of term (i.e. additional 15/60% earned)</li></ul><p>Level 3, 100% – Levels 1 and 2 achieved, and: </p><ul><li>Reading/discussion/observation engagement consistently achieves the “check-plus” level by the end of term (i.e. final 15/60% earned)</li></ul><p>If any of the lower levels are not completed successfully, maximum points possible at higher levels will be adjusted downward accordingly. <i><strong>NOTE: Points for missed observation and participation assignments cannot be made up without a self-declaration in Quest or verification of illness (VIF). See the Administrative Policy below on declaring an absence. </strong></i></p><h3>What are the expectations for projects?</h3><p>Problem-solving is a verb (i.e., a process), so you will demonstrate your mastery by doing it through two projects in interdisciplinary groups (i.e., the Instruction Team will strive to create groups of students with different backgrounds). <i>Group projects</i> are meant to be done in groups, and submitted as a single, consistent, coherent submission. The project should reflect the group as a whole, not just the monumental efforts of a few participants.<strong> </strong>To ensure that a group project reflects the efforts of all group members, everyone will receive the same mark on the project. Completing the project will involve coordination and cooperation, and may involve diplomatically encouraging some group members to step up, and others to step back. </p><ul><li><i>Individual assignments </i>prepare you to make contributions to the group. At the start of each project, group members should<ul><li>Contribute to drafting a group resume and team charter</li><li>Complete a <strong>prior art observation. </strong>Students will be given class time to discuss these with each other, as such discussion informs the group's understanding of the design challenge. Students must still produce original work from their individual effort, maintaining academic integrity (more on this can be found in the Administrative Policy section).</li></ul></li><li><i>Group deliverables:</i> A project display and writeup (i.e., the Project Dossier) of how the group developed their solution to the design challenge</li><li><i>Individual reflections</i> after each project prepare you to take lessons learned forward to the next project. Such reflections are to be prepared and submitted individually.</li><li><strong>Note: if there are any concerns with the academic integrity of a group project, all group members will be considered responsible.</strong> In the Faculty of Environment, all group submissions must include a signed ENV Group Assignment Disclosure form. Knowing how to balance discussion with others while avoiding copying and other academic offences may seem tricky. Some suggestions: After you discuss a project or idea with a colleague, take a one-hour break to have food, read/watch something, exercise – do whatever you like – before writing up the idea. This will mean that the writeup comes out in your own words, and it will allow you to confirm that you have integrated the discussion into your own thinking (i.e., acquired new knowledge) rather than just reproducing the discussion.</li></ul><h3>Assignment submission and return</h3><ul><li>To minimize implicit bias in grading, assignments other than the Final ePortfolio will be marked anonymously in LEARN. This means that marks will be recorded without knowing the identity of the student. To help with this process, <strong>please use only your SID and/or group number (e.g., PSA Group 1, ED Group 5)</strong> to identify your assignment submission. After all assignments have been marked, LEARN will put your name on the assignment.</li><li>Assignments are to be submitted electronically no later than 11:59 PM Eastern Time on the specified due date unless stated otherwise in the Tentative Schedule of classes (e.g., "start of class").</li><li>Marked assignments will be returned electronically. For each assignment, be sure to consult the instructions for where to submit, as the course employs different platforms (e.g., LEARN, Kritik) that are best suited for each assignment.</li><li><strong>Be sure to <u>follow directions</u> for assignment submission. If you do not, the mark on your assignment is subject to a 5% penalty </strong>for not following directions. <i><strong>This means that an assignment that presents work at the quality level of 85% can be knocked down to 80% for not following directions. </strong></i>Any of the following errors will result in a penalty:<ul><li>Leaving identifying information on your assignment (especially your name)</li><li>Failing to provide a file in the requested format (e.g., providing a .ppt file when a document file is specified)</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Late submissions:</strong> Each student will be allocated a total of 4<strong> </strong>grace days, which allow assignments to be handed in late without penalty during the lecture and/or examination period. These grace days include use of the 2-day <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences">short-term absence</a> that students can self-declare in Quest (however, if students do not activate the short-term absence, they may still apply a total of 4 grace days to late submissions). At the end of the term, the total number of late days (including weekends) will be counted, the 4 grace days will be subtracted, and you will receive a 1% penalty on your <strong><u>overall</u></strong> course grade for each late day beyond the grace days and any short-term absences. For example, if at the end term, the reflection for Project 1 was late by 5 days and the prior art observation for Project 2 was late by 5 days but overlapped with a short-term absence in Quest, this reflects a total of 8 late days (8 = 5 + 5 - 2) for assignments. Because 2 short-term absence days were used, 2 further grace days will be subtracted from the total late days to arrive at a balance of 6 late days (6 = 8 - 2). This translates to a 6% late penalty on the final course grade at the end of the term.<strong> </strong></p><p> </p>

<h3>Respectful Behavior</h3><p>Policy 33, Ethical Behavior, addresses expectations for all members of the university, including faculty, staff, and students. The general principle of Policy 33 is that “each member of the University endeavor to contribute to the existence of a just and supportive community based on equality and respect for individual differences.” Disrespectful or offensive behavior will not be tolerated. Policy 33 also prohibits “a poisoned environment (or one that is intimidating, hostile, or offensive).” For more information about what constitutes discrimination, harassment, or a poisoned environment, see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33"><u>Policy 33, Ethical Behavior</u></a>. </p><p>Furthermore, many students don’t realize that Policy 71, Student Discipline, covers both academic and non-academic offenses, such as disrupting other students’ learning. In particular, Policy 71 prohibits “disruptive, dangerous, aggressive or threatening behavior, including by electronic means.” </p><p><strong>The instructor is committed to creating a safe, respectful, and supportive learning environment.</strong> If you have been the target of hostile or disrespectful behavior, or you think you have witnessed another student engaging in such behavior towards other students in class, please email the instructor immediately.</p>
