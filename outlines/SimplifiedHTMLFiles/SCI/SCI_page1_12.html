<div>SCI 300:</div>
<p>These special topics courses will cover material relevant to all students in the Faculty of Science. Course content is not specific to an individual program.</p>

<p>Graduating students from the Faculty of Science will be expected to navigate what’s been called a VUCA world; one marked by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA). To thrive in this world, graduates will need to be self-directed learners able to adapt to changing landscapes, develop resilience, grapple with ambiguity, interdependencies, and inter-relationships. </p><p> The course uses the student-led, individually created course (SLICC) framework allowing students to co-create their learning journey by <strong>intentionally and explicitly planning for the development of key lifelong learning competencies (listed below and outlined in the </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/career-development/prepare-your-career/frtf-resource-hub"><strong>Future Ready Talent Framework</strong></a><strong><u>)</u></strong> while volunteering or working in their chosen setting. </p><p>To participate in this course, students MUST have secured the position before the start of the term and ensure that they are able to complete a minimum of 100 hours (10 or more hours per week) during the term working on developing the key competency they’ve chosen.  </p><p>The future ready talent framework (FRTF) defines competencies as a combination of skills, abilities and knowledge.  Key competencies are established for successfully navigating the emerging global workplace.  For this course, students should select one key competency from the list below to develop during their work placement. </p><p>The key competency is then developed using the SLICC framework.  This will guide students through the process of planning and executing how they will successfully demonstrate that they have met the learning outcomes for the course that are listed below. </p><p> </p><p>FRTF Key Competencies </p><p><strong>Initiative:</strong> </p><ul><li>Seek learning opportunities, both formal and informal; </li><li>Take initiatives to connect with others about career opportunities. </li></ul><p><strong>Communication:</strong> </p><ul><li>Articulate thoughts and ideas clearly in oral and written forms to persons inside and outside of your organization; </li><li>Listen actively and ask questions to better understand other person’s viewpoints. </li></ul><p><strong>Career Development:</strong> </p><ul><li>Set career learning goals and identify opportunities to achieve those goals; </li><li>Explore how personal values and interests align with occupational demands, tasks, goals and environments. </li></ul><p><strong>Information Literacy:</strong> </p><ul><li>Synthesize data from multiple sources into meaningful information; </li><li>Present this synthesis to members of your organization to seek feedback. </li></ul><p><strong>Technological Agility:</strong> </p><ul><li>Apply a new technology to achieve a better result; </li><li>Advocate for the use of innovative technologies. </li></ul><p><strong>Implementation and Collaboration:</strong> </p><ul><li>Structure, coordinate, organize your projects and tasks; </li><li>Share responsibility with other team members to solve the problems of others. </li></ul><p> </p>

<h3>Notes on Course Grading</h3><ul><li>Overall grade for Weekly Reflections will not simply be an aggregate of the individual grades.  The grade assigned will assess and demonstrate your growth in learning to critically and deeply reflect on an issue.</li><li>The Midterm Reflective Report grade may be transferred to the Final Reflective Report if there is evidence that feedback from the Midterm Report has been used to significantly improve performance.</li><li>Because of the subjective nature of grading in this course, the overall course grade will be rounded to the nearest decile (e.g. 60, 70, 80, 90, 100).</li></ul><h3><strong>In the case of illness: </strong> </h3><p>If students are not able to complete the full 100 hours in a term, they can submit VIF for this absence, and contact the instructor to determine the timeline for completion of the course. </p><p> </p>

Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images.

  University Policy

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
