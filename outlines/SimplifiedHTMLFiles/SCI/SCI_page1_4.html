Note that assignments CANNOT be submitted after their due times. Please check the schedule above for assignment due dates.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Grading:</strong> The final grade in the course will be based on <strong>12 online assignments (w/ 2 lowest marked ones excluded)</strong>, two <strong>midterms</strong> and a<strong> final </strong>exam. Assignments will be posted on the Mastering Astronomy webpage (accessible through LEARN) a week in advance, and solutions will become available immediately after the due time. The midterms will be held on <i><strong>February 4th and March 17th</strong></i>. The final exam will be on Wednesday<strong>, April 16th</strong>. The final grade will be determined using the scheme above. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Work expected:</strong> Students are expected to attend lectures, complete assigned readings, work through the weekly online assignments, and sit the midterm and the final. No exceptions to these requirements will generally be made in cases where students miss classes or do not complete assignments. The general workload for the course should be (on average) <strong>3 hours of lectures, 3 hours of reading, and 3 hours of online assignments</strong>, plus additional study time for exams. Students should also check the course website regularly for course announcements.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Group Work/Discussion of Results:</strong> Collaboration and/or discussion with other students are allowed on assignments. Online assignments must, nonetheless be completed individually by each student, using their own account.</p><p><strong>Plagiarism in completing assignments is a serious offence, that can significantly affect your academic standing, and even prevent you from graduation.</strong> This includes (but is not limited to) verbatim copies of answers off the web (or off other students), without following proper citation protocols.</p><p> </p><p><strong>No form of collaboration, copying, or discussion is allowed on the final examination, nor on the midterm. </strong>However, calculators, as well as any textbooks/notes can be used in the exams.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Examinations:</strong> Attendance at examinations is mandatory, and exams will not generally be rescheduled, except in cases of severe illness or personal trauma. Student travel plans are <strong>not </strong>considered acceptable grounds for granting an alternative examination time. Any medical exceptions must be documented by a signed medical note from a doctor or clinic, indicating the date and severity of the illness, and will only be accepted at the instructor’s discretion. Exams will not be excused for minor complaints. Students with chronic health problems should consult with the Office of Disabilities for alternate exam arrangements.</p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-undergraduate-office/academic-policies-and-procedures/accommodation-illness-or-other-extenuating-circumstances#submitting">Please consult the Accommodation for illness or other extenuating circumstances.</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Public Health: </strong>In the event of public health restrictions on in-person learning, the lectures and exams will be held online.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Equity, Diversity, and Inclusivity</h3><p>In this course, you should expect to be treated fairly and with respect by everyone on the instructional team and all your peers. You should expect an equal opportunity to learn. You are also expected to behave fairly and respectfully toward everyone else and avoid behaviours that make it harder for others to be comfortable. Everyone in this course has equally earned their place. Please help to create a welcoming and inclusive environment by, for example, refraining from discussing a person’s appearance or making assumptions based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or other personal characteristics. </p><p>If you have a concern about how you or someone else is being treated, some of the people you can contact at the University of Waterloo include your instructor, (insert your name here); the Associate Dean of Science for Teaching and Learning, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/chemistry/profile/ldeakin"><u>Laura Deakin</u></a>; the University of Waterloo’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/conflict-management-human-rights/cmahro-resources/documenting-complaint-harassment"><u>Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Office</u></a>; and the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/conflict-management-human-rights/cmahro-resources/documenting-complaint-harassment"><u>Conflict Management &amp; Human Rights Office</u></a>.  If you experience or witness sexual assault or domestic violence, contact the Waterloo Region Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence Treatment Centre. A specialized team is located 24/7 at the Emergency Department of St. Mary’s General Hospital or call (519) 749-6994. If you are in immediate danger or crisis at anytime, please call 911.</p><p> </p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>With gratitude, we acknowledge that Renison University College is located on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg, Hodinohsyó:ni, and Attawandaran (Neutral) Peoples, which is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes ten kilometres on each side of the Grand River from mouth to source. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place in all corners of our campus through research, learning, teaching, community building and outreach. We are guided by the work of our Reconciliation and Re-storying Steering Committee and Anti-Racism and Decolonization Spokescouncil, as well as the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous"><u>University of Waterloo’s Office of Indigenous Relations</u></a>.</p><p> </p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as analytic deduction, reasoning, and computation. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
