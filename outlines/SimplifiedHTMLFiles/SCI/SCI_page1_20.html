<div>
<div>GENE 404:</div>
<p>This is the second course in a two-course sequence where students from more than one engineering plan work together to solve an interdisciplinary engineering problem. At the end of this course students will be able to re-formulate and re-communicate an engineering problem or opportunity (as appropriate); revise and communicate a feasible design project plan; revise solutions that address the formulated problem (as appropriate); implement and verify design solutions by analysis, test or prototype; communicate design solutions using accepted data formats, working documents and oral presentations; address safety, regulatory, sustainability and professional ethics requirements, as appropriate; effectively manage and communicate design project plans, technical and non-technical risks, using project management tools and techniques; work effectively as an interdisciplinary team member and/or team leader.</p>

<p>UW is excited about Future Cities! On the heels of launching the Future Cities Institute, UW is offering a new special course: an interdisciplinary capstone course involving students and professors from multiple faculties working together to explore the complex challenges of Future Cities. Each student team will have four students and a faculty mentor, who will work 10 hours per week for eight months.</p><p>In the first half of the course (Fall 2024), you will develop a deep understanding of the focal problem through months of thoughtful research, building the foundation for your project (e.g. problem definition, situation analysis, conducting a literature review, solutions identification and evaluation, and managing your team and your project and developing your communication skills). You'll receive feedback on your understanding of the problem and potential solutions through presentations to instructors, experts, classmates, and, in some cases, soliciting external partner/client feedback.</p><p>The second part of the course (Winter 2025) will focus on testing/refining your solution through primary research and data analysis to provide evidence of the viability of your proposed solutions, followed by developing an implementation plan. The final product of the i-capstone will include an oral poster presentation and may include a comprehensive written report, prototype, business plan, user manual, academic article, etc., depending on the intended target audience and determined through discussion with and approved by the instructor.  </p><p>All capstone courses across campus allow you to apply the knowledge you have acquired through your studies and co-op over the past four years. Where i-capstone differs is that you get to engage with other motivated learners from across faculties to leverage your unique perspectives, knowledge and skills, to contribute to solution-oriented projects that demonstrate <strong>mastery of problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication</strong> on a selected topic under the theme of Future Cities.</p><h4><strong>Didactic vs Dialectic Instruction</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Didactic</strong> instruction is the mode of most university courses: lectures, textbooks, assignments, exams.<ul><li>This is a <i>solitary</i> experience. You learn and are evaluated independently.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Dialectic</strong> instruction is a more ancient mode of instruction: learning through reasoned dialogue.<ul><li>This is a <i>social</i> experience. You are part of a team, also interacting and learning with other teams.</li><li>Capstone is a dialectic learning experience.</li><li>The <i>depth</i> of your learning comes from your own project.</li><li>The <i>breadth</i> of your learning comes from other projects.</li><li>Attendance and participation are important.</li></ul></li></ul><h4><strong>Formative vs Summative Assessment</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Summative</strong> assessment measures what you have learned, how well you have learned it, etc.<ul><li>Exams, for example.</li><li>Most didactic courses focus on summative assessment.</li><li>Summative assessment gives a measure of performance, but does not give advice on how to improve.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Formative</strong> assessment identifies the learning gaps between current performance and the intended learning outcomes/expectations.<ul><li>Formative assessment helps to improve your project.</li><li>Capstone involves a lot of formative assessment, both giving and receiving.</li></ul></li></ul><p> </p>

That is primarily written materials.

You need to do something that makes sense for your project. Developing your sense of professional judgment is an intended learning objective.</li><li>Writing your project abstract is one deliverable with a slightly tighter definition, as it is more common across projects.
