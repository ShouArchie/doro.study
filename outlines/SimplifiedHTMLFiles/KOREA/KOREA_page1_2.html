<p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations. </a></p><p><strong>Renison Language Course Selection Notes: </strong></p><ul><li>Students who are interested in the Korean language courses should be aware that the completion of at least three courses in a subject is recommended for a minimum working knowledge of the language. The Korean and East Asian culture courses may provide useful background for students intending to spend time in the Far East.</li><li>Students who have previous experience with or who have studied the Korean language at the elementary or secondary school level should not enrol in first-year level courses of the same language. Such students should consult the Renison Registrar's Office regarding the appropriate level to enter.</li><li>Students are not permitted to enrol in more than one Korean language course in a term.</li><li>Renison University College reserves the right to refuse admission to, and/or credit for, any of its language courses to a student who has, in Renison's view, a level of competence unsuited to the course(s).</li></ul><p><strong>Attendance Policy</strong></p><p>Students should make every effort to attend each class and class component (tutorial, lab, etc.) as scheduled. If a student is aware of an upcoming absence, the student should inform the instructor, and the TA if applicable, as soon as possible after the realization.</p><p><strong>Late or Incomplete Work</strong></p><p>Students should make every effort to submit their assignments on time. Late work will be deducted cumulatively at 10% each day that the assignment is late, including weekends. If a student anticipates a conflict with an assignment deadline or has concerns about completing the assignment, the student should contact the instructor as soon as possible once the realization is made.</p><p><strong>Policy on Plagiarism </strong></p><p>“Policy 71’s glossary defines plagiarism, in part, as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others (whether attributed or anonymous) as one’s own in any work submitted whether or not for grading purposes”…</p><p>The Vice-President Academic and Dean has the authority to assess instances of plagiarism and the resultant penalties that are raised by an instructor. An instructor can propose a grade penalty to the Vice-President Academic and Dean, who will decide whether to accept the penalty or initiate a formal inquiry.”</p><p>For additional information on how plagiarism is dealt with at Renison, review the policy from where the above text is copied: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 - Student Discipline</a>.</p><p>Students should also be aware that copyright laws in Canada prohibit reproducing more than 10% of any work without permission from its author, publisher, or other copyright holder. See Waterloo’s policy on <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/fair-dealing-advisory">Fair Dealing</a>.  Violation of Canada’s Copyright Act is a punishable academic offence under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71 – Student Discipline</a>.</p><p><strong>Electronic Device Policy </strong></p><p>Students who choose to use electronic devices to support their learning may do so provided that the individuals in the class are not disturbed or prohibited from their own learning. Electronic devices should be used for the purposes of supplementing the learning experience and focusing on topics being discussed in class. Phones should be kept in silent mode during the class.</p><p><strong>Communication Policy </strong></p><p>Email, using the uWaterloo provided email address, is the approved method of communication with UWaterloo faculty, staff, and students. The Office 365 email that you use to login using your WatIAM login and password is secure and confidential.</p><p><strong>Anti-Racism Statement</strong></p><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/presidents-anti-racism-taskforce/part-report/equity@uwaterloo.ca"><u>equity@uwaterloo.ca</u></a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website.</a></p><p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p><p>Students should be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. </p><p>Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof);</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides);</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.  For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years.  In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p><strong>Mental Health Support</strong></p><p>All of us need a support system.

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework.
