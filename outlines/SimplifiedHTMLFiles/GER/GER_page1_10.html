</div>
<div>
<p>GER 202 is organized around three topics that develop your knowledge and understanding of German-speaking people and their everyday life. The course focuses on improving your visual, aural, textual and grammatical skills as interdependent competences that are developed simultaneously in language learning.</p><p>The course is divided into three main modules, each four weeks long, each focusing on one topic, and each foregrounding certain competencies through project work.</p>

  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course, you should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>read shorter, straightforward factual texts on subjects related to your chosen field and interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>scan longer texts in order to locate desired information, and gather information from different parts of a text, or from different texts in order to fulfill a specific task.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>understand the information content of the majority of recorded or broadcast audio material on topics of personal interest delivered in clear speech in (Colloquial) Standard German.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>follow short films and other video clips in which visuals and action carry much of the storyline, and which are delivered clearly in straightforward language.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>catch the main points in TV programs on familiar topics when the delivery is relatively slow and clear (or can be re-watched/re-listened to).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>identify unfamiliar words from the context on topics related to your field and interests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>understand some fundamental characteristics of spoken interaction (e.g., the connection of verbal language and gesture), as well as differences between spoken and written German.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>use some structures of German that are specific to spoken language in appropriate oral contexts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>give a prepared straightforward presentation on a familiar or recently researched topic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div>
<p>At the same time the course aims to help you develop and improve your translingual and transcultural awareness and knowledge. That may sound odd, abstract, or lofty to you… so here is what it means:  </p><p>What you will also learn/develop in this course is:</p><ul><li>topic-relevant knowledge of vocabulary and language structures, awareness of difference between different linguistic ways of expressing them in different languages; e.g., passive voice, subordinate clauses, da-/wo-compounds,</li><li>cultural knowledge about contemporary Germany: meaning and relevance of, e.g., popular music, common images in every-day life,</li><li>awareness of stereotyping in everyday cultural encounters, and knowledge of auto- and hetero-stereotypes about Germans, Canadians, others, and</li><li>knowledge about identity construction through language, cultural symbols, and transcultural differences/specificities (e.g., music). </li></ul><p> </p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Submitting Your Own Work</h4><p>All graded work in this course (quizzes, assignments, exams) will be done individually by default, i.e., by yourself without the help of others (including other students, friends, family members, tutors) and without consultations. Graded work that can be done/should with a partner is clearly marked as such.</p><p>For any other (that is, non-graded) course work and in practicing for quizzes, assignments, and exams, you are welcome and encouraged to work with other students in your class or with a tutor. If you work with a tutor on improving your language skills, remember that tutors – including German-speaking friends or partners – are there to <i>help you</i> do your work (for example to answer specific questions you have about word meaning or grammar points or the appropriateness of certain expressions in specific situations and contexts), but not to do it for you (for example to go through a draft of your work and identify/correct all mistakes).</p><h4>Working With and Without Dictionaries, Materials, etc.</h4><p>All quizzes and other tests in this course are closed-book by default, unless otherwise specified in the quiz/test instructions. In other words, you are expected to do them without using any materials, including texts and your own notes, dictionaries (online or paper), translating tools (e.g., Google Translate) or text-generating tools (see GenAI policy), unless otherwise specified. You are also not allowed to ask other persons to help you during quizzes and tests.  </p><p>For assignments and projects, you are encouraged to make full use of your class materials and notes, as well as your vocabulary lists, and paper/online dictionaries. Use of online translation tools is allowed for improving your knowledge of vocabulary and pronunciation - make sure you consult the guidelines for dictionaries and online translation tools that we provide to understand the best ways to do this to support your learning. This document will help you understand what the possibilities and limitations are of different types of tools for learning words and word meaning (as well as word pronunciation) and how to make the most of them in your language learning!</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used, where specified, with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will be outlined on assignment instructions; unless otherwise specified, you may not use GenAI tools for activities and assessments. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><h4>Late Policy</h4><p>Vokabelquiz and Modul-Tests are subject to a <strong>Dual Deadline Policy</strong>. This means that these assignments have two deadlines, a <strong>Regular Deadline</strong> and an <strong>Extended Deadline</strong>.</p><p>Students who meet the <strong>Regular Deadline</strong> will:</p><ul><li>Have their quiz or test returned to them <strong>two weeks</strong> after the Regular Deadline.</li><li>Will not have to complete a quiz or test in addition to working through new material and new activities.</li><li>Bask in the satisfaction of completing a task on time.</li></ul><p>You should always try to meet the regular deadline for quizzes and module tests.  But of course, sometimes life gets in the way of your studies. Perhaps you've been ill, there has been a family emergency, or you've had a lot of work in other classes. In these situations, you can take advantage of the <strong>Extended Deadline</strong>. Here's how it works:</p><ul><li>Extended Deadlines are available for the <strong>Vokabelquiz</strong> and <strong>Modul-Tests</strong> only.</li><li>The Extended Deadline is automatic; there is no need to request an extension.</li><li>The Extended Deadline is <strong>one week</strong> after the Regular Deadline.</li><li>Students will have to complete the quiz/module test while also working through new material and new activities.</li><li>Students will receive their work back within <strong>two weeks</strong> of the Extended Deadline.</li><li>Students won't be able to bask in any sort of sunshine.</li></ul><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><p>No extensions are granted beyond the Extended Deadlines, nor are any extensions granted for weekly Engagement &amp; Interaction activities and Module Projects. </p><p>Weekly Engagement &amp; Interaction activities and Module Projects submitted after the deadline will have a grade of 0.</p><p>Consult the <strong>Course Schedule</strong> in LEARN for all due dates.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>
