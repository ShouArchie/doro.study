  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>GER 101:</div>
<p>This course aims to bring German language, culture, and everyday life into the classroom. Students with little or no prior knowledge are introduced to the structure of German and develop their listening/comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing skills. Classes are communicative and emphasize interaction in German. Online exercises and audio/video materials accompany each chapter of the textbook.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Additional interactive online exercises and audio/video materials accompany each chapter of the textbook. Weekly creative and communicative assignments such as discussion forums and video/audio assignments will encourage the students to make use of their learnings in authentic contexts.</p><p>The main goal of this course is to equip you with a basic ability in German.</p>

<h2>
  Learning Outcomes
</h2>
<div>
<span>By the end of this course students should be able to:</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>understand and speak German with a good degree of accuracy and confidence;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>read and understand the main content of German texts about every-day matters, and</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>write about yourself, your daily life, and experiences in German.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div>
<h2><strong>Methods and Other Goals</strong></h2><p>Another goal of this course is to introduce you to a style of language learning in which communication plays a key role. You will learn grammar and language structures too, but you will learn them through real-life tasks and through interaction with others. Your instructors hope that you will have fun with the various learning materials assembled in GER 101, and that they will help ease the transition into another language.</p><p><strong>Please note</strong> that GER 101 is <strong>not open</strong> to students with OAC German, 4U German, or the equivalent. Students with some background in German should contact the course instructor or the course coordinator before (or at the very beginning of) the course to ensure they have chosen the right level.</p><p><strong>Also note</strong> that in order to learn a language, you need to review the material in a regular, consistent fashion. Remaining on top of the material is essential for doing well in this course. Language learning is a continuous activity, it is best done through regular practice. In order to stay on top of this course and to do as well as you can, you need to put in at least <strong>eight hours of work per week</strong>. Learning a language from scratch is possible for anybody, regardless of whether you think of yourself as gifted in learning languages or not. It is really the effort put in, the regular contact with the language, and the serious engagement with the materials and tasks that determines success.</p><p>Learning a language at a distance can be a challenge, and time management is crucial. You will, of course, want to understand <i>all</i> of those grammatical rules that you encounter and remember <i>all</i> the vocabulary introduced, but this is not really necessary.  One of the goals of this course is to teach you to <strong>make good guesses about new forms and words</strong> you see, so that you don’t have to look everything up. The more exposure to written and spoken texts you have, and the more you practice, the more comfortable you will feel with the language and the better you will get at understanding and speaking it.  <strong>Language learning is a very practical activity</strong>. You learn by doing. What is it you do in this course? You read, you listen, you write, and you speak. Try to do all four regularly—the tutoring elements and the tasks are set up to allow you to do exactly that. By the way, speaking means speaking aloud. Don't be shy, talk to a roommate, your pet or even your mirror. And do take advantage of <strong>additional opportunities for oral practice, for example the regular online Conversation Hour</strong>! </p><p>So, language learning has a lot to do with communication—both receiving plenty of input in the foreign language (there is <i>plenty</i> of material), but also output, i.e. producing words, phrases, sentences, small texts to share and make yourself understood in German. You will receive written and/or oral feedback from your instructor on your contributions in forum discussions, video/audio assignments and homework.</p><p>Viel Spaß!</p>

The answer keys for these activities are available in LEARN Table of Contents under the Course Information module. </p><h3><strong>A Note on the e-Textbook</strong></h3><p>For this class, you have the option of purchasing a traditional printed textbook from the University of Waterloo bookstore (or online wherever you prefer) or purchasing the digital version of the textbook from the publisher. We recommend that you purchase the print book if possible, but we recognize that for some students (especially those at a distance) this can prove difficult, and an e-text version may be the only option.</p><p>The digital version of the textbook is only available for purchase through the publisher’s website which is entirely in German. If you are having difficulty reading the website in German, you may be able to translate the site using Google. For instructions on how to do so, visit Googe Translate Help: <a href="https://support.google.com/translate/answer/2534559?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop"><u>Translate documents &amp; websites</u></a>.</p><p>Please note that you must <strong>register for a “private customer account” (für Privatkunden) </strong>from Cornelsen. Please <strong>do not register for a “student account” (für Schüler/-innen) </strong>as this level of access does not allow you to make purchases. This level of access is for children in grade-school and will not provide you with full access to the e-textbook.</p><h3><strong>Recommended:</strong></h3><ul><li><a href="https://oliviahill.com/german-grammar/?utm_source=sf&amp;utm_medium=email1&amp;utm_campaign=REP_GER07_A&amp;campaign=08aa428d-70a3-441b-aa0a-8ca1216560ad&amp;campaigncontact=2ca86fb3-8ff1-45e0-9f5f-a173bdf1f008"><u>English Grammar for Students of German</u></a><i>: The Study Guide for Those Learning German</i>, Cecile Zorach and Adam Oberlin, seventh edition, Olivia &amp; Hill Press Inc.</li></ul><p>You might want to buy or borrow this book if you want to learn more about grammatical terminology in German and English.

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h3>Office Hours and Additional Practice</h3><p>There will be optional <strong>weekly</strong> <strong>Conversation Hours, which are held virtually</strong> (details to be announced). There will also be regular 'walk-in' office hours (details to be announced); for the latter, it is recommended that you announce your visit via e-mail to secure a spot. The <strong>Conversation Hour and our office hours</strong> are the best opportunity for additional practice and to receive feedback on your progress throughout the term.</p><h4>Late Policy</h4><p>All assignments and quizzes are due on the date specified in the Course Schedule. No late submissions will be accepted and no extensions or re-takes of quizzes are granted. </p><h4>Submitting your own work in GER 101</h4><p>All <strong>graded</strong> work in this course (quizzes, assignments, exam) will be done <strong>individually </strong>by default, i.e., by yourself without the help of others (including other students, friends, family members, tutors) and without consultations.</p><p>For any other (that is, non-graded) course work and in <strong>practicing</strong> for quizzes, assignments and the exam, you are welcome and encouraged to work with other students in your class or with a tutor. If you work with a <strong>tutor</strong> on improving your language skills, remember that tutors – including German-speaking friends or partners – are there to help you do your work (for example to answer specific questions you have about word meaning or grammar points or the appropriateness of certain expressions in specific situations and contexts), but <strong>not</strong> to do it for you (for example to go through a draft of your work and correct all mistakes).</p><h4>Working with and without dictionaries, materials, etc. in GER 101</h4><p>All <strong>quizzes and the exam</strong> in this course are<strong> closed-book </strong>by default, i.e., you are expected to do them without using any materials, including textbook, notes, (online) dictionaries and translating services (e.g., Google Translate). You are also not allowed to ask other persons to help you during quizzes and exams.</p><p>For <strong>assignments</strong>, you are allowed to work with your <strong>class materials</strong> and with proper <strong>dictionaries</strong>. The best “dictionary” is the <strong>glossary</strong> for your textbook <i>Das Leben</i>. It contains all vocabulary you need for this course. If you occasionally need additional vocabulary or want to look up information on how to use a certain word in context, you may use printed or online dictionaries such as <i>dict.cc</i> and <i>linguee.de</i>.</p><p>Use of <strong>translating services</strong> (e.g., <i>google </i>translate) is <strong>not allowed</strong> under any circumstance. They are NOT dictionaries, even if they are linked to as part of an online dictionary. These services are not considered good resources for <strong>learning languages: </strong>They will not help you learn to use German independently and confidently, and the results they present are often inappropriate for the specific communicative context, difficult to understand, or simply wrong. The use of such translation services constitutes an academic offence and will be handled according to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>University’s Policy 71 — Student Discipline</u></a>.</p><p>Please note that <strong>Google Translate</strong> is NOT a dictionary but rather a kind of (error-prone) personal translator. Google Translate is not allowed as a resource for work in German 101, and we will treat instances of suspected Google Translate use on assignments as cases of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/academic-misconduct"><u>academic misconduct</u></a>, which means that we will formally report them to your undergraduate dean of students.</p><p>For further information on academic integrity and other University policies pertaining to this course, please visit the <strong>University Policies</strong> section of the Course Outline.</p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Since this is a beginner language course, any use of artificial intelligence or machine translation would counteract the language learning objectives. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p>

<h4>Accommodating religious and spiritual observances </h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>The University of Waterloo has a duty to <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Accommodations">accommodate religious, spiritual, and other creed-based beliefs and practices</a> under the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2015) <a href="https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed"><i>Policy on preventing discrimination based on creed</i></a>. Students may seek accommodations for missed course components on religious, spiritual, or other creed grounds. In such cases the students should please consult the instructor within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which the accommodation is being sought.  Students also may request accommodations for temporary absences from classes or other course-related activities to engage in prayer or other daily spiritual practices. Instructors are expected to make reasonable arrangements to respectfully accommodate such requests. The University of Waterloo has a number of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/multi-faith-spirituality-resource-team/multi-faith-spaces-campus"><u>multi-faith spaces</u></a> that students can use for faith-based practices.</p><h4>Declaring absences</h4><p><i><strong>[Applies only to students taking undergraduate courses]</strong></i></p><p>Please see the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Regulations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Regulations</a> section of the Undergraduate Calendar for more details. Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructor so that the instructor can determine how to accommodate the missed work. </p><p><strong>Absences due to religious, creed, and spiritual observances</strong></p><p>Beginning Fall 2024, students can submit a <u>Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest. </u>This form allows the student to register dates of potential conflicts with coursework. Students are expected to record their absence within two weeks of announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. Submission through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. </p><p><strong>Absences due to verified illness </strong></p><p>For absences due to illness that are not pandemic-related, students need to obtain a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances Process</a>. Submission through the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a>, once registered, will notify your instructors of your absence. Students <u>should not</u> submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to your instructors, teaching assistants, or other course personnel.  To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their health condition.</p><p><strong>Absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement)</strong></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., bereavement, serious family illness), students submit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/undergraduate/student-support/accommodations-illness-or-extenuating-circumstances#submit-other">a request for absence due to extenuating circumstances</a> to the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Absence Verification System</a> for processing. Students use the form to submit supporting documentation, which will be considered in a comparable manner to a VIF. Official documentation is necessary before any action can be taken. Examples are plane/train/bus tickets, court documents, police reports, death certificates/obituaries/letters from funeral directors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able to given their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Self-declared absences due to COVID-related illness</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> an absence on Quest due to COVID-related illness or a requirement to self-isolate. A self-declared COVID absence covers up to 10 days and no documentation is required. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in on-line components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence.  It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong>Self-declared short-term absences for any reason</strong></p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">self-declare</a> one short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason. A short-term absence covers two calendar days, and <u>no documentation is required</u>. The student has only one self-declared short-term absence per term and this absence can only be used during the formal lecture period. Self-declared absences cannot be applied to Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), or Studio (STU) course components.  Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><h4>Recording lecture</h4><p>Use of recording devices during lectures is only allowed with explicit permission of the instructor of the course. If allowed, video recordings may only include images of the instructor and not fellow classmates. Posting of videos or links to the video to any website, including but not limited to social media sites such as: Facebook, Twitter, etc., is strictly prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
