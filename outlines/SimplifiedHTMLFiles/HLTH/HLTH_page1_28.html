<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p>In addition to the University of Waterloo regulations, including those described under the <strong>University Policy</strong> section, the following course practices will apply.</p><h3>Deadlines</h3><p><strong>Submissions are due by 11:30 PM Eastern Time on the due date</strong>. Refer to the Course Schedule in LEARN for deadlines.</p><p>Because answers to the quiz are released automatically after the deadline, late quiz submissions cannot be accepted. Submissions for the Critical Appraisal Template: Team Task are also not credited after the deadline as delays adversely affect your fellow students. Thus, <strong>for the quiz and Critical Appraisal Template: Team Task, submissions are not accepted after the deadline and will receive a mark of zero</strong>.</p><p>For assignments and Epi in the News, late submissions are accepted but late penalties apply, consistent with School policy.</p><ul><li>In fairness to students who do submit their work on time, <strong>10% of the earned mark will be deducted </strong>per 24-hour period to a maximum of 5 days.</li><li><strong>After the 5-day maximum, assignments will not be accepted</strong> and a grade of zero will be recorded.</li><li>See further information under the School Late Policy section below.</li></ul><p>I appreciate that life can present unexpected or ongoing challenges and there may be specific circumstances that warrant reconsideration of these deadlines. Please review the information on the Student Support Resources page in LEARN, especially AccessAbility Services, and refer to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp?q=accommodations&amp;&amp;limit=20&amp;skip=0&amp;bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Assessments%3A%20Academic%20Considerations%20and%20Accommodations&amp;bcItemType=policies">Accommodations</a> to course requirements in the University Regulations and in the Course Outline. Please contact the instructor and we will work together to support your successful completion of this course while remaining fair to other students.</p><p>In addition, everyone could use some extra flexibility to avoid late penalties. So, <strong>flexibility in meeting deadlines has been built into this course in two ways: grace periods and slip days</strong>. </p><h4>Grace Periods</h4><ul><li>The submission deadline is 11:30 PM on the due date for all course assessments. However, in an online world, issues with slow internet connections and other last-minute challenges can mean that you could miss the deadline by a few minutes.</li><li>To avoid late penalties for submissions that just miss the deadline, a grace period will be allowed between 11:30 PM and 11:59 PM. Submissions later than this (i.e., from 12:00 AM onwards on the next calendar day) will be considered late.</li></ul><h4>Slip Days</h4><p>Slip days provide an automatic extension of deadlines with no questions asked.</p><ul><li>Everyone has a <strong>bank of 3 slip days</strong> to use, if needed, to extend the deadlines for <strong>individual assignments</strong>.<ul><li>Thus,<strong> slip days may be used for any of the individual assignments</strong> (Assignments 1, Assignment 3, and Assignment 4), <strong>but not for Quiz 1, Epi in the News or any team task</strong> (Critical Appraisal Template or Assignment 2).</li></ul></li><li>A slip day is a 24-hour grace period. <strong>One slip day is applied for an automatic extension of up to 24 hours</strong>; it cannot be divided into partial days.</li><li>Slip days are not transferable from one student to another.</li><li>You decide how to best use your bank of slip days (e.g., use all on the same assignment to extend the deadline at a particularly busy time, or use only some or none of the days in your bank).</li><li>These are your slip days. <strong>You do not need to request permission to use a slip day</strong>. You do not need to notify the instructor or TAs if you are using slip days, although it is helpful if you note this in your dropbox submission. If a submission is late but eligible for slip days, we will assume that you are using slip days and automatically apply them unless you indicate otherwise in the dropbox submission.</li><li>You are responsible for keeping track of your slip days. Usual late penalties will apply once you have used your bank of slip days.</li></ul><h3>Late Policies</h3><p>After application of the grace periods and slip days described above for flexibility in meeting course deadlines, late submissions will incur the consequences described above, unless accommodations are approved by the instructor. All assignments are due as specified in the Course Schedule and Activities and Assessments webpages in LEARN.</p><ul><li>Elective arrangements (e.g., travel plans) or heavy workloads are not considered acceptable grounds for variance.</li><li>Students are responsible for ensuring that assignments submitted via online dropboxes are properly uploaded to and are saved with the extension/file format that is specified by the instructor.<ul><li>Unless otherwise indicated, assignments that are not submitted properly by the due date listed in the course outline will receive a mark of zero.</li><li>Students may attempt to properly submit assignments after the due date but the instructor reserves the right to consider this as a late submission with late penalties as indicated in the course outline.</li><li>You will receive a confirmation email for assignments successfully submitted in LEARN. In the case of a submission discrepancy, you will be required to provide that email as proof of submission.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Academic Considerations and Accommodations</h4><p>In addition to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policies">University Regulations</a>, the following Faculty of Health rules apply. Students have the following options for declaring an absence during the Winter 2025 term. </p><ul><li>Students are expected to notify their instructor(s) <strong>before or within 24 hours</strong> of the missed course element. The Verification of Illness Form should be submitted within 48 hours of the missed course element, if the student is well enough to do so.</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-graduate-students">COVID-19-related absence</a> - an absence of 10 days or less due to COVID-19 related illness (including vaccination side-effects) or a requirement to self-isolate. <strong>Participation in online course elements may be reasonable</strong>. Students can self-declare <strong>one</strong> COVID-19-related absence in an academic term.</li><li>For absences that do not meet the COVID-19 criteria, for self-declared absences that exceed the maximum number permitted per term, or for (retroactive) reports of illness, students are required to submit the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services">Verification of Illness Form</a>. A high-quality photo of documentation should be uploaded to the intake form.  See also <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-graduate-students">How do I self-declare an absence (graduate students)?</a></li><li>Some students may seek academic accommodations on religious grounds. Students must consult with their instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought.</li><li>If the student’s absence is due to extenuating circumstances, they should use the VIF intake form via <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">https://vif.uwaterloo.ca</a>. Students will be required to upload a PDF or high-quality photo of their documentation to the intake form. See also <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-graduate-students">How do I self-declare an absence (graduate students)?</a></li></ul><h3>Students Rights and Responsibilities</h3><p>Institutions of higher learning recognize that an effective education is one that repeatedly challenges the student while providing an opportunity for the student to learn to meet those challenges. Instructors strive to provide tests and examinations that discriminate among students according to their varying success in learning to meet and overcome respective challenges. This implies that these are integral components of a successful higher education: </p><ul><li>You are responsible for and may be tested on any lecture material (including videos or other learning aids), readings, and all other course materials (with the exception of materials identified as optional resources).</li><li>You are expected to check the course LEARN web page on a regular basis for announcements concerning schedule changes to classes and office hours, additional reference materials, answers to common questions, etc.</li><li>The most effective learning takes place through an active and constructive, rather than a passive, process.  You are therefore obligated to do more than simply memorize course information.</li><li>Assignment Grading: If you believe that an error has been made in grading a course requirement, please contact the TA who marked your assignment. <strong>You have 7 days from when you receive your assignment mark to request that the TA look over your assignment</strong> with you and possibly adjust marks.  After that time, you MAY NOT request a re-grade.  Students who believe they provided valid answers that have not been addressed by the TA are invited to make a case to the instructor after an initial discussion with the TA. The instructor reserves the right to re-grade any portion of the submitted material. Hence, it is possible that an appeal may result in a lower grade.</li></ul><h3>Collaboration and Academic Integrity</h3><p>Collaboration is a key component of the team tasks (Assignment 2 and Critical Appraisal Template). It can be valuable for you to discuss your ideas or brainstorm with your peers about the course material. The quiz, Epi in the News activity, and individual assignments, however, must be completed independently and any external sources must be appropriately acknowledged using standard reference citation styles.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as searching and identifying relevant information, performing calculations, synthesizing ideas, developing logical arguments, and clearly and accurately communicating your ideas.  Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71</a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf">ICAI</a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence">Copyright Advisory Committee</a>. </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources">Student Success Office</a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students">Writing and Communication Centre</a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students">AccessAbility Services</a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide">Library</a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4>Turnitin®</h4><p>Text matching software (Turnitin®) will be used to screen Assignment 4. Turnitin is being used in this course as an <strong>educational tool</strong> to help students understand the proper use of quotation marks, how to cite sources properly, and how to paraphrase. <strong>Students will be able to see the Turnitin similarity report</strong>. Early submission to Turnitin allows students to review the similarity report and, if necessary, revise their assignment accordingly until the deadline. </p><p>Note that: </p><ul><li>Only content related to this course may be submitted to the Turnitin dropbox in LEARN. Materials for use in other courses are not to be submitted. Unauthorized submissions will be treated as a breach of academic integrity.</li><li>The Assignment 4 dropbox is set up to work with Turnitin so that new submissions replace previous submissions: thus, any older submissions you revise after viewing the similarity reports are erased.</li><li>Additional Turnitin resources are provided with the Assignment 4 instructions.</li></ul><p>For additional details on Turnitin, please see the University Policy section below.</p><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>A territorial acknowledgement is a small step towards reconciliation and needs to followed by actions, such as education. As a researcher focusing on the epidemiology of aging, I focus on the aging process and the experience of being an older adult, within the context of individual lives and our families, communities and health and social systems. I recognize aging as an embedded personal history, and the impact of history in the lived experience of older adults, particularly those with past and present histories of oppression and colonialism. I acknowledge the historical and current presence and land rights of Indigenous peoples within Canada. I recognize that as a settler I have benefited from the land in the past and continue to do so. As an epidemiologist, I also acknowledge the multi-generational impact of this history of oppression and colonialism on the risk factors and associated health outcomes of Indigenous Peoples and the importance of addressing this context in public health research and practice.</p><p>We take this time to reflect, in the spirit of Truth and Reconciliation. I acknowledge that I live and work on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. The main campus of the University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/">Office of Indigenous Relations</a>. </p>
