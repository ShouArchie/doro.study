<h3>PRE-REQUISITES </h3><p>It is strongly recommended that you complete all core courses before enrolling in the professional practicum course. However, there are rare cases where exceptions may be made. See below for more detail. Core courses are defined by degree and intake cohort (e.g., Fall 2018 MPH cohort).  </p><p>The prerequisites are: </p><h4>MPH students: </h4><ul><li>HLTH 602A: Foundations of Public Health</li><li>HLTH 603: Health Policy</li><li>HLTH 605B: Quantitative Methods and Analysis</li><li>[or HLTH 605A: Regression Models – blended option]</li><li>HLTH 607: Social, Cultural and Behavioural Aspects of Public Health</li><li>HLTH 604: Public Health and the Environment</li><li>HLTH 606B: Principles of Epidemiology (prereq: HLTH 605B)</li><li>[or HLTH 606A: Epidemiological Methods – blended option (prereq: HLTH 605A/B)]</li><li>HLTH 608: Health and Risk Communication in Public Health</li><li>HLTH 609: Management and Administration of Public Health Services</li><li>HLTH 617: Population Intervention for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion</li><li>HLTH 618: Research tools for public health</li></ul><h4>MHE students: </h4><ul><li>HLTH 656: Quantitative Methods and Analysis or HLTH 605B: Quantitative Methods and Analysis</li><li>HLTH 614: Foundations of Program Evaluation</li><li>HLTH 655: Health Measurement and Survey Analysis</li><li>HLTH 651: Theory and Applications in Program Evaluation</li><li>HLTH 652: Qualitative Methods and Analysis</li><li>HLTH 654: Systems Thinking and Analysis in Health Program Planning and Evaluation or HLTH 611: The Health Care System</li><li>HLTH 653: Evaluation Practice and Management</li></ul><h4>MHI students: </h4><ul><li>HLTH 613: Information Technology for Health Professionals</li><li>HLTH 615: Requirements Specification and Analysis in Health Systems</li><li>HLTH 611: The Health Care System</li><li>HLTH 637: Public Health Informatics</li><li>CS 792 (‘held with’ HLTH 612): Data Structures and Standards (Note: MHI students are to take CS 792 not HLTH 612)</li><li>CS 634: Security and Privacy in Health Systems</li><li>CS 638: Principles of Data Management and Use</li><li>-OR-</li><li>HLTH 605b: Quantitative Methods and Analysis</li><li><i>Note: part-time students take this before the practicum, but full-time students take this after the practicum</i></li></ul><p> </p><h4>Note: </h4><p>In rare, exceptional circumstances, students may be permitted to undertake a practicum before their prerequisite coursework is complete.  In these cases, students may request permission to waive remaining pre-requisites by emailing the Practicum Coordinator and Course Instructor with. Please see review the list of example scenarios below. </p><p>If you have only <u>one core course remaining</u>, it is acceptable to complete your final core course concurrently with HLTH-640, or in a term following HLTH-640, particularly if necessitated by scheduling issues.  If this is your situation, you do not require approval and can enroll in HTLH-640 directly, without any further communications. </p><p>If you have <u>three or more core courses remaining</u>, you are ineligible to take HLTH-640 at this time.  Under no circumstances will such requests be approved, and further correspondence requesting such approvals may not receive a response. </p><p>If you have <u>two core courses remaining</u>, you may request to take the practicum if you meet the following conditions: </p><ul><li>you are in good academic standing (not in conditional standing);</li><li>you have a practicum opportunity arranged, that would not be possible in later terms;</li><li>your practicum opportunity does not rely on material to be learned in the missing core courses; and</li><li>you have a plan to complete the remaining courses.</li></ul><p>In these cases, you may request permission to take the practicum before or concurrent with the remaining core course by emailing the Practicum Coordinator and Course Instructor with:  </p><ul><li>a list of the specific core courses you would need “waived”;</li><li>a description of the practicum opportunity, including the timing in relation to your remaining pre-requisite courses;"</li></ul><p>It is important to note that not all requests will be granted.  </p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<p>Please see the Course Schedule in LEARN for complete details.</p><h2><strong>PLACEMENT HOURS &amp; OTHER CONSIDERATIONS: </strong> </h2><p><i><strong>Required contact hours:</strong></i><strong> </strong>The required number of contact hours required for the MPH / MHE / MHI practicum is <strong><u>420-hours</u></strong> over a minimum of 12-weeks.  </p><h3>Other Considerations:  </h3><h4>Unpaid placements:  </h4><p>If you are completing an unpaid practicum, <u>an Affiliation Agreement</u> must be signed (or already be in place) between the University (Faculty of Health) and the host organization.  <strong>As soon as you have a host organization identified for an unpaid placement, </strong>email the <strong>Experiential Learning and Communication Specialist</strong> to begin this process.  Note that it can take days to months for these agreements to be signed, so plan far in advance.   </p><p>It is a University of Waterloo requirement that you complete the insurance forms (regardless of other circumstances, e.g., other insurance you may carry). See <u>Forms &amp; Documents</u> section.  </p><p>Note that there is no cost to you or your placement organization for this insurance (the forms ensure that you are covered by Waterloo’s insurance so your host organization doesn’t have to cover you). You simply need to complete the forms, including Practicum Placement Supervisor signatures where noted, and submit the completed forms at the same time as your Learning Contract. See <u>Forms &amp; Documents</u>. </p><h4>Part-time placements: </h4><p>Practicum placements that extend beyond one term (e.g., over two terms, at half-time hours) are considered part-time. Note that if you do a part-time placement, you must remain in ‘active’ status (and thus pay tuition) for both terms. Note that you are also required to follow the course outline (i.e., syllabus) for the term in which you enroll, which is the first term of a two-term practicum. You may not take more than two terms to complete your placement. </p><h4>Placements at your place of employment: </h4><p>Ideally, the practicum placement activities should be separate from your work (i.e., not your regular job), and your practicum placement supervisor should be different from your regular manager. You do not have to give up your current position at your workplace while completing your practicum (e.g., you may simply assume a new temporary role with a different supervisor for the purposes of your practicum). </p><h4>Placements Outside of Canada: </h4><p>If you plan an out-of-country practicum placement, there are special international travel safety and security requirements that must be completed <strong><u>prior</u></strong> to approvals to proceed with your international practicum.  </p><p>Prior to travel, review the <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories"><u>Canadian Government's Travel Advice and Advisories </u></a>for the specific country/region.  Confirm the advisory level for your destination.  Travel to countries identified as either 'Avoid non-essential travel' or 'Avoid all travel' is not normally allowed.  </p><p>Waterloo International requires you to complete the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/international/travel-safety-and-security/international-travel-registration-form"><u>Pre-departure Travel Form</u></a>.  Once the form has been submitted a member of the Safety Abroad Team will initiate completion of your International Travel Checklist.  Waterloo International will work closely with you to ensure you have completed all of the required steps in order for you to meet your safety and security responsibilities and will inform the practicum coordinator when your International Travel Checklist is complete. </p><p>As part of the Practicum Learning Contract, you must agree to complete the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/international/travel-safety-and-security"><u>international travel safety and security requirements</u></a> as outlined by Waterloo International <strong><u>prior</u></strong> to departure.  This includes but is not limited to completion of pre-departure orientation and assessment in LEARN, registration with the travel safety and security provider, and registration with the government of the country of the passport you are travelling on. </p>

  Student Assessment
</h2>
<div>There is no defined grading scheme for this course.</div>
<a></a>
<div></div>
<div>
<h3>ASSESSMENTS &amp; COMPETENCIES </h3><p><i><strong>Assessments: </strong></i>The practicum is graded on a Credit/Non-credit (pass/fail) basis.  To receive 'Credit' (i.e., pass), students must complete the following: </p><ol><li>submit all required documents in a timely manner, and have all documents approved;</li><li>receive a recommendation for a 'pass' from your practicum placement supervisor on your Final Evaluation; and</li><li>successfully achieve your identified five or more competencies, as evidenced by your two or more submitted products and reflection. <br/>MPH students from the 2019 cohort onwards must also:</li><li>receive approval for required PebblePad submission(s).</li></ol><p><i><strong>Receiving a grade: </strong></i>At the end of the enrolled term (see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/important-dates/list"><u>Important Dates</u></a>), all students enrolled in the course will receive an official course grade (i.e., credit) within <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/"><u>Quest</u></a>. Official course grades, credit, and academic standing can be viewed in QUEST at the end of the term. The LEARN course website is not the official location to view official grades.  </p><p>Students completing a part-time (i.e., &gt;1 term) placements, or students completing a full-time (i.e., 1-term) placement who did not submit all required documents (including any revisions) by the end-of-term deadlines, will be given an INC (incomplete).  Then, once your placement is complete, and your final documentation approved, we will change your grade accordingly.  </p><p>If you have an INC in a course, you must remain in 'active' status for the duration of the INC.  Thus, if this is the last term of your degree, it is particularly important to ensure you meet the end-of-term deadline, to avoid paying tuition next term.  Note that documents that miss the end-of-term deadline will be reviewed in the first 1-2 weeks of the following term. </p><p><i><strong>Required competency development: </strong></i>Through your practicum placement, you must develop five or more professional competencies specific to your degree, i.e., MPH / MHE / MHE, and demonstrate how you have gained the competencies via submission of two or more products, and an accompanying reflection. </p><ul><li>Public Health (MPH) Competencies (see LEARN course website for MPH Competencies).</li><li>Health Evaluation (MHE) Competencies (see LEARN course website for MHE Competencies).</li><li>Health Informatics (MHI) Competencies (see LEARN course website for MHI Competencies).</li></ul><p> </p><h2>X. REQUIRED FORMS &amp; DOCUMENTS </h2><p> All of the forms and documents to be submitted for the successful completion of your practicum are outlined below. All submissions must be via the LEARN course website and in the designated dropboxes.  </p><p>Before submitting forms and documents, be sure to carefully check that all of the required signatures are included.  Verified/certified e-signatures (e.g., DocuSign) and scanned/photographed signed copies (as long as all pages are included) are both sufficient. </p><h3>Insurance Forms </h3><p>All students who are taking unpaid practicums are required to complete and submit the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/occupational-health-safety/student-unpaid-work"><u>Insurance Forms</u></a> for insurance coverage. These forms must be submitted using the Insurance Forms for Unpaid Practicums Dropbox (see LEARN course website). </p><ul><li>Insurance Forms (link to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/occupational-health-safety/student-unpaid-work"><u>Insurance Form</u></a><u>s</u>).</li><li>Insurance Forms Dropbox (see LEARN course website).</li></ul><h3>A. LEARNING CONTRACT </h3><p>Once you secure your practicum, discuss with your Practicum Placement Supervisor your learning goals (including the competencies you want to attain) and placement opportunities/activities, and begin drafting the Learning Contract. While you may use Learning Contracts from prior terms as templates to help guide your draft (e.g., as available on the LEARN community site), you must use the <i>specific</i> Learning Contract form that is posted in the LEARN course website for the term in which you are enrolled. </p><p>In your Learning Contract, you must identify five (or more) competencies that will be developed during your practicum. Take care to ensure you are using the up-to-date competencies relevant to your program (MPH/MHI/MHE). You must also identify two (or more) products / deliverable that you will submit as evidence that you developed the identified competencies (see <u>Student Final Report</u> section below). All competencies chosen must have a linked product that will be used to demonstrate their development.  </p><p>Students should plan to submit their completed Learning Contracts (and other University forms, if needed) approximately 2-4 weeks before the start of their practicum placement. This is to help avoid delays in approvals, and to provide the time for any necessary revisions. </p><p><i>Additional Reminders</i>:  </p><p>Learning Contract approval for unpaid placements is contingent upon completion and submission of the required Insurance Forms and the completion of an affiliation agreement </p><ul><li>Learning Contract word document (see LEARN course website).</li><li>Learning Contract Dropbox (see LEARN course website).</li></ul><h3>B. PLACEMENT INTERIM EVALUATION </h3><p>At the halfway point of your placement, you and your Practicum Placement Supervisor should meet to discuss your progress. Your Practicum Placement Supervisor will need to complete and sign the Interim Evaluation form, which will provide an assessment of your progress to-date.  </p><p>This is the time at which you should discuss any current or anticipated challenges for the completion of your practicum. This is also the recommended time to flag any inter-professional issues and discuss with the Practicum Coordinator (cc’ing the Course Instructor), fortunately, though, this is a rare occurrence. </p><ul><li>Interim Evaluation word document form (see LEARN course website).</li><li>Interim Evaluation dropbox (see LEARN course website).</li></ul><h3>C. STUDENT FINAL REPORT (aka “reflection”) and PRODUCTS/DELIVERABLES  </h3><p>Student are required to demonstrate how they met five (or more) identified competencies from their Learning Contract, using the Student Final Report document. For each competency, students will briefly describe how they attained the competency, and substantiate their description by citing the relevant parts of the two (or more) products / deliverables from their practicum as evidence of competency attainment. </p><p>Students must submit a minimum of two products / deliverables from their practicum but can submit as many as needed to demonstrate that they met each of the competencies. ‘Products / deliverables’ are items generated for the placement organization during the activities of the placement. A wide range of products / deliverables are acceptable, such as reports, evaluations, analyses, presentations, and many others. Students are encouraged to choose the ‘products / deliverables’ that are specific to their practicum and the work that was performed. If a product / deliverable you generated included many contributors, i.e., a group product / deliverable, submit only the portion that you created (e.g., the draft literature review you wrote for a larger report). If this is not possible, contact the Course Instructor to discuss options. </p><ul><li>Student Final Report word document (see LEARN course website).</li><li>Student Final Report Dropbox (see LEARN course website).</li></ul><h3>D. PLACEMENT FINAL EVALUATION </h3><p>At the end of your placement (but in advance of the end-of-term deadline!), you and your practicum placement supervisor should meet to discuss your achievements. Your practicum placement supervisor will need to complete and sign the Final Evaluation form. Within this form, they will provide feedback about your competency attainment, and will recommend a pass/credit or fail/no-credit on your practicum. In the rare case of a ‘fail’, you will need to meet with the Practicum Coordinator and Course Instructor to develop a plan to achieve the ‘pass’ for the course. </p><ul><li>Final Report word document (see LEARN course website).</li><li>Final Report Dropbox (see LEARN course website).</li></ul><h3>E.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.
