  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>HLTH 604:</div>
<p>This course will explore the major sources of environmental stressors and types of environmental processes posing a risk to public health, and the mechanisms through which these interact with biological systems to exert adverse effects on human health.</p>
<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>This course is a basic-level core course within the MPH program, which examines a series of important topics that link public health theory and practice with environmental issues in Canada and around the world. The course is intended for both experienced and aspiring public health professionals.</p><p>It is expected that students will already have a basic knowledge of public health concepts and terminology, based on successful completion of the HLTH 602 course "Foundations of Public Health". A basic knowledge of epidemiological concepts and terminology is also expected. There is no requirement for previous specialized coursework in chemistry, biology, environmental sciences, or in the basic and clinical health sciences—each student will be expected to bring their own unique academic learning and work experiences to the course discussions and assignments.</p><p>The course will focus principally on physical, biological, and chemical hazards within the environment that affect human health—but an appreciation of the importance of social, behavioural, and political factors in determining environmental health status will also be examined in some detail. There will be a strong focus both on environmental health problems in Canada and in global public health problems related to the environment, especially in low income countries (LICs). There will also be an emphasis on systems-based approaches (e.g., EcoHealth and One Health) for addressing environmental problems that affect ecological and human health.</p><p>More advanced topics relevant to public health and the environment will be covered in Year-2 elective courses within the MPH program—these will include HLTH 624 Environmental Toxicology, and courses in Applied Epidemiology, and Health Exposure Assessment &amp; Risk Assessment.</p>

  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

After five days, a grade of zero will be recorded for the assignment.</p><p>The late policy will apply to Assignments 1 and 2, Mini-Assignments A and B, the Polls, and the Exit Survey.</p><h4>Student Health and Well-Being</h4><p>You are a valued part of our community. We recognize that our individual identities shape our experiences in higher education. Some of us disproportionately encounter systemic barriers to belonging. University life can be difficult with multiple demands. The Faculty of Health is committed and actively working to foster an environment where you belong and can thrive. You may experience stressors that can impact your personal well-being and academic experience, but there are multiple supports and resources available to you on and off-campus:</p><ul><li><a href="https://warriors.uwaterloo.ca/"><u>Athletics and Recreation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/"><u>Campus Wellness - Counselling and Health Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/counselling-services"><u>Counselling Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://wusa.ca/services/empower-me"><u>Empower Me - Student Assistance Program</u></a></li><li><a href="https://good2talk.ca/"><u>Good 2 Talk</u></a>  (or available by phone at 1-866-925-5454)</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-student-association/"><u>Graduate Student Association</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.here247.ca/"><u>Here 24 Seven - Addictions, Mental Health &amp; Crisis Services Waterloo-Wellington</u></a> (or available by phone at 1-844-HERE247 (1-844-437-3247))</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/students/international-student-resources"><u>International Student Resources</u></a></li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/"><u>Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism</u></a></li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/student-resources/student-supports-and-clubs"><u>Office of Indigenous Relations – Student Supports and Clubs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/student-financial-services"><u>Student Financial Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/"><u>Student Success Office</u></a></li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/"><u>University of Waterloo Information on COVID-19</u></a></li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a></li></ul><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, including the use of research databases to access, interpret, integrate, and summarize information related to the biological and environmental determinants of health. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
