<p>Summary of Assessments that address the Learning outcomes (more detailed guidelines and rubrics are available in LEARN)</p><ol><li><strong>PebblePad Workbook Reflection Portfolio - 10% of grade, individual assessment</strong><ol><li>Each week you are asked to reflect on course content, an activity from class, a reading, or your participation in the health innovation challenge.  For this assessment, you are asked to curate your best five reflections together for a Reflection Portfolio and provide a broad justification for how these reflections align with the rubric.  The rubric assesses the level of clarity, the relevance of the learning experience, analysis of the experience and how it contributes to student learning, interconnections to past experiences/other courses/personal goals, and evidence of self-criticism such as awareness and knowledge of limits and new modes of thinking as a result.  Due Date: April 4 (last day of classes for term).</li></ol></li><li><strong>Health Innovation Challenge - 35% of grade, mostly group assessment</strong><ol><li>The Health Innovation challenge is an activity that emphasizes social entrepreneurship and will take place during class time over the term in partnership with staff at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/united-college/greenhouse">Greenhouse</a> and participating organizations, community members, and mentors.  Students will participate in 3 community engagement sessions to speak with community partners on challenges related to accessibility and its relationship to public health and well-being as well as receive feedback on their understanding of the system of interest, gaps as well as potential solutions.  In between these sessions students will participate in workshops with their group members to draft a system map of the problem space, ideate solutions and interventions, learn technical skills on prototyping solutions, and prepare for communicating with partners to ask questions and develop insights as well as network for future opportunities.  The assessments and deliverables required for the Health Innovation challenge are as follows (more detailed information is provided in LEARN and PebblePad, including rubrics):<ol><li>Group Charter (group assessment, worth 2%). The purpose of this activity is to describe how the group will work effectively together.  Due date: February 26</li><li>System Framing  (individual assessment, worth 5%).  After community engagement session 1, students will frame the system in the problem space related to accessibility and health  (3-5 sentences) that they would like to focus on based on the discussions, with justification (2-3 sentences) for why they think this is an important area to focus on.  The <u>maximum length</u> of this assignment is two pages. Due date: Feb 5</li><li>Participation in group work and collaboration/engagement with community stakeholders (individual assessment, worth 5%).  This grade will be made up of a peer assessment component as well as assessment from the teaching team (i.e. instructor, TA, GreenHouse staff, mentors).  Peer assessment of fellow group members is due on April 7.</li><li>Outline of system framing /solution ideas as well as questions for Community Engagement session 2 (group assessment, worth 8%). A template will be provided for the outline.  Due date: February 28</li><li>Final Systems Map and Solution for Demo Day to communicate the groups' ideas and solutions (eg poster, prototype, recorded video presentation, or storyboard) (group assessment, worth 15%).  Due date: March 28th</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><strong>Career ePortfolio Project - 45% of grade, individual assessment</strong><ol><li>A Career Portfolio is a cumulative assignment for HLTH 480 that is meant to support you in your career journey.  You will start the Career Portfolio by preparing the structure in PebblePad and add to it throughout the term with assignments that take place and are graded as the term progresses.  You will also add examples that demonstrate your skills from other course assignments or experiences from your undergraduate program. Your Career Portfolio will contain the following elements:<ol><li>PebblePad Structure for the entire Career Portfolio.  (Deadline:  January 17, worth 2%)</li><li>Homepage with a biography, overall philosophy/values statement and career goals, use of visuals, and other multi-media.  (Deadline:  January 31, worth 4%)</li><li>Linkage to LinkedIN profile– create a LinkedIN profile page or update it if you already have one set up and link the LinkedIN profile to the Career Portfolio. (Deadline: March 28, worth 4%)</li><li>Alignment with competencies developed - Illustrate how course assignments and/or experiences from your undergraduate program have helped you to develop core competencies and skills within the field of health sciences and public health.  One of the competencies/skills you must describe is public health communication.  The other competency/skill may be related to your career aspirations.<ol><li>Deadline for Public Health Communication competency tab: February 14 (worth 10%)</li><li>Deadline to complete tab for other competency/skill: March 7 (worth 10%)</li></ol></li><li>Reflection about the Health Innovation Challenge - Another tab in the career ePortfolio will include a reflection on the community partner sessions and application of the social innovation process to address challenges in accessibility and PH/health. Your reflection should address the development of skills in critical thinking, an innovation mindset, communication, collaboration, and leadership that are important for future careers. Include examples of artifacts from your group's work on the health innovation challenge, such as the final systems map, deliverable for demo day, the outline of the problem space, photos of sticky notes from the ideation and solution generation workshop, etc.  (Deadline:  April 9, worth 15%).  This is also a chance to polish up the entire Career Portfolio based on feedback you have received.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><strong>Engagement - 10% of grade, individual assessment</strong><ol><li>Your level of engagement will be assessed based on the following elements:<ol><li>In-class discussions with instructors and peers and participating in workshops from Greenhouse and the Centre for Career Development</li><li>Online engagement - students are expected to complete weekly PebblePad workbook reflections by answering the prompts provided</li><li>Peer evaluation and feedback on the ePortfolios</li><li>Meetings with team members/instructors/mentors/community stakeholders outside of normal class time</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy

<div>
<h4><strong>Late Assignments and Slip days</strong></h4><p>While students are expected to complete assignments on time, they will have 5<strong> slip days to use over the course of the term for any of the individual assignments</strong>. This means that students will have five extra days to use for due dates with no questions asked. Students can use several of the days for one assignment or use them separately for several assignments. <strong>Please note that this option is NOT available for <u>Group assignment deadlines</u>, which must be completed on time</strong> (eg your group must be ready to communicate their solutions to community stakeholders during Demo day).  If you decide to use slip days for one of your individual assignment deadlines, please email your TA via email PRIOR TO the due date to avoid a late penalty.</p><p>Once you have used up all of your slip days if you complete an assignment late, a penalty of 5% will be applied for every 24 hours that an assignment is late, up until 7 days after the due date.</p><p>After 7 days, late assignments will NOT be accepted and a grade of "zero" will be recorded for the assignment.</p><p>If you have extenuating circumstances, (see below under "Student Absences - Accommodations for illness or other Extenuating Circumstances"), you may be granted an extension on an Assignment even after you have used up your slip days.</p><h4><strong>Student Absences – Accommodation for illness or other extenuating circumstances</strong></h4><p>From time to time, students will encounter extenuating circumstances such as significant illnesses or mental health challenges, ongoing medical conditions, unforeseen emergencies, a death of a loved one, or religious observances that prevent them from meeting academic obligations. The University is committed to assisting students who experience these events.  If you miss a course element (e.g., exam, due date of an assignment, in-class participation activity, etc) due to extenuating circumstances, <strong>please notify your course instructor</strong> by email as soon as you can, preferably <strong>within 24 hours of the missed course element.</strong> In addition, <strong>please follow the appropriate step below to document your absence.  </strong></p><p>Students have the following options for declaring an absence <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students">in Quest</a> during the Fall 2024 term:</p><ol><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/current-students/undergraduate-student-short-term-absences">Short-term Absence</a> (once/term) - an absence of 2 calendar days or less during the <i>formal lecture period</i>.

The webform includes a list of courses the student is currently enrolled in, and the student is required to indicate any missed elements. Students should not be submitting their Verification of Illness Form (or other documentation) to instructors or advisors.  The UG Associate Dean’s Office will review each submission, including documentation, and determine whether to approve the absence request. Once approved, students and instructors will receive a confirmation email of the absence. Advisors will be notified if there are questions or concerns about a student’s well-being, such as submitting multiple VIFs in one academic term or documentation for a lengthy absence.</li><li>If the student’s absence is due to <strong>extenuating circumstances other than illness</strong> (e.g., funeral, varsity sports, etc. ), they should use the  <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/instructor#/">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances web form </a>.</li></ol><p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p><ul><li>Students are only permitted <strong>one self-declared short-term absence per academic term </strong>and only during the formal lecture period<strong> </strong>(i.e., it cannot be used to defer a final exam or assessment due during the final exam period).</li><li>Students who are registered with <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility services</a> (AAS) and who have missed an assignment deadline due to their registered condition, for which an accommodation is appropriate, should fill in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/missed-course-component">AAS missed course component form</a> (only for missed assignment deadlines or participation grade, not for missed quizzes, tests, or exams).  Please also give a heads up to <strong>the course instructor</strong> within 24 hours of the missed deadline so that they will know to expect an email message from AAS.</li><li><strong>Adjustment of due dates</strong> or <strong>deferrals of midterm or final exams</strong> <strong>are not automatic</strong> upon submission of a Self-Declaration of Illness or Verification of Illness or other documentation.</li><li>Timely communication with your course instructor (within 24 hours of the missed component) is required in order for any requests for accommodations to be considered.</li><li>If you are falling behind in multiple courses or you have an extended illness, <strong>please connect with an academic advisor</strong> to discuss what additional supports you might need, such as registering with <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students">AccessAbility services</a>, reducing your course load, or accessing resources from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/">Student Success Office</a>.</li></ul><p><i><strong>Students are expected to notify their instructor(s) before or within 24 hours of the missed course element.</strong></i></p><h4><strong>Health and Wellbeing</strong></h4><p>Students are a valued part of the University of Waterloo community. We recognize that our individual identities shape our experiences in higher education. Some of us disproportionately encounter systemic barriers to belonging. University life can be difficult with multiple demands. The Faculty of Health is committed and actively working to foster an environment where students belong and can thrive. Students may experience stressors that can impact his/her/their personal well-being and academic experience, but there are multiple supports and resources available both on and off-campus. </p><p><strong><u>Support Services and Resources: </u></strong></p><p><strong>Academic Advisors: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-undergraduates/advisors">https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-undergraduates/advisors</a></p><p><strong>HEALTH weCONNECTu Peer Mentorship Program:</strong>  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-undergraduates/first-year/mentorship-program">https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-undergraduates/first-year/mentorship-program</a> </p><p><strong>Athletics and Recreation:</strong> <a href="http://warriors.uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">http://warriors.uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</a></p><p><strong>Campus Wellness: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</a></p><p><strong>Counselling and Health Services:</strong> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</a> </p><p><strong>Empower Me: Student Assistance Program</strong>: <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/empower-me">https://wusa.ca/services/empower-me</a></p><p><strong>Food Support Service: </strong><a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/food-support-service/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/food-support-service/</a></p><p><strong>Glow Centre for Sexual and Gender Diversity:</strong> <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/glow/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/glow/</a></p><p><strong>Good 2 Talk: </strong><a href="http://www.good2talk.ca/">www.good2talk.ca</a> or 1-866-925-5454</p><p><strong>Here 24 Seven:</strong> <a href="http://www.here247.ca/">www.here247.ca</a> or 1-844-HERE247 (1-844-437-3247) </p><p><strong>International Student Resources:</strong> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/students/international-student-resources">https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/students/international-student-resources</a></p><p><strong>Off Campus Community:</strong> <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/off-campus-community/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/off-campus-community/</a></p><p><strong>Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism:</strong> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office/resources-tools-get-support">https://uwaterloo.ca/human-rights-equity-inclusion/equity-office/resources-tools-get-support</a></p><p><strong>Office of Indigenous Relations:</strong> Student Supports and Clubs - <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/student-resources/student-supports-and-clubs">https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/student-resources/student-supports-and-clubs</a></p><p><strong>Racial Advocacy for Inclusion, Solidarity and Equity (RAISE):</strong> <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/raise/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/raise/</a></p><p><strong>Student Financial Services:</strong> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/student-financial-services">https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/student-financial-services</a></p><p><strong>Student Legal Protection Program:</strong> <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-legal-protection-program">https://wusa.ca/services/student-legal-protection-program</a></p><p><strong>Student Success Office:</strong> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/">https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/</a></p><p><strong>UW Mates Peer Support:</strong> <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/uw-mates">https://wusa.ca/services/uw-mates</a></p><p><strong>University of Waterloo Information on COVID-19:</strong> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/">https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/</a></p><p><strong>Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA):</strong> <a href="https://wusa.ca/about/">https://wusa.ca/about/</a></p><p><strong>Writing and Communication Centre:</strong> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/">https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/</a></p><h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples.

  University Policy

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
