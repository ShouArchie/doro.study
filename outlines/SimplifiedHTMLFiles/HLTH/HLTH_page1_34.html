<h3>School of Public Health and Health Systems Practice Regarding Course Assignments and Examinations</h3><p>For detailed information regarding late assignments, missed tests/examinations, and other department policies applicable to this course, please refer to the <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/content/enforced/1093658-HLTH611_081_cel_1251/media/documents/SPHHS_missedcomponentpractice_2011.pdf?isCourseFile=true&amp;ou=1093658"><u>Practice Regarding Course Assignments and Examinations (PDF)</u></a> document.</p><h3>Generative AI</h3><p> </p><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as using analytical frameworks and critical thinking to analyze the healthcare system functions and performance, and producing reports and visualizations that can be used by professional audience.. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h3>Territorial Acknowledgement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><h3>Anti-racism Statement</h3><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at equity@uwaterloo.ca or through their website.  </p><h3>Intellectual Property</h3><p>Be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of the instructor, teaching assistant, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof).</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides).</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or teaching assistant or used by the instructor or teaching assistant with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, teaching assistant and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, teaching assistant or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights and academic integrity. </p><h3>Supports and Resources</h3><p><i>You are a valued part of our community. We recognize that our individual identities shape our experiences in higher education. Some of us disproportionately encounter systemic barriers to belonging. University life can be difficult with multiple demands. The Faculty of Health is committed and actively working to foster an environment where you belong and can thrive. You may experience stressors that can impact your personal well-being and academic experience, but there are multiple supports and resources available to you on and off-campus.</i></p><p><strong>Academic advisors</strong> – <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/health/current-undergraduates/advisors">https://uwaterloo.ca/health/current-undergraduates/advisors</a></p><p><strong>Athletics and Recreation </strong>- <a href="http://warriors.uwaterloo.ca/">http://warriors.uwaterloo.ca/</a></p><p><strong>Campus Wellness - Counselling and Health Services </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</a></p><p><strong>Co-operative Education -</strong> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/">https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/</a></p><p><strong>Empower Me - Student Assistance Program</strong> – <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-supports/empower-me/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-supports/empower-me/</a></p><p><strong>Food Support Service </strong>– <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/food-support-service/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/food-support-service/</a></p><p><strong>Glow Centre for Sexual and Gender Diversity </strong>– <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/glow/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/glow/</a></p><p><strong>Good 2 Talk </strong>(free, confidential support services for post-secondary students in ON)<strong> </strong>–<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.good2talk.ca">www.good2talk.ca</a> or 1-866-925-5454</p><p><strong>Here 24 Seven </strong>(addictions, mental health &amp; crisis services Waterloo-Wellington)<strong> </strong>- <a href="http://www.here247.ca">www.here247.ca</a> or 1-844-HERE247 (1-844-437-3247)</p><p><strong>International Student Resources </strong>– <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/international-experience/international-student-resources">https://uwaterloo.ca/international-experience/international-student-resources</a></p><p><strong>Off Campus Community</strong> - <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/off-campus-community/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/off-campus-community/</a></p><p><strong>Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Anti-racism </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/</a></p><p><strong>Office of Indigenous Relations – Student Supports and Clubs - </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/student-resources/student-supports-and-clubs">https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous/student-resources/student-supports-and-clubs</a></p><p><strong>Racial Advocacy for Inclusion, Solidarity and Equity (RAISE) </strong>- <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/raise/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/raise/</a></p><p><strong>Student Financial Services </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/student-financial-services">https://uwaterloo.ca/finance/student-financial-services</a></p><p><strong>Student Legal Protection Program </strong>– <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-supports/student-legal-protection-program/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-supports/student-legal-protection-program/</a></p><p> <strong>Student Success Office </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/">https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/</a> </p><p><strong>UW Mates Peer Support</strong> – <a href="https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/mates/">https://wusa.ca/services/student-run-services/mates/</a></p><p><strong>Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) </strong>– <a href="https://wusa.ca/about/">https://wusa.ca/about/</a></p><p><strong>weCONNECTu Peer Mentorship Program (Faculty of Health) </strong>– <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/health/current-undergraduates/first-year/mentorship-program">https://uwaterloo.ca/health/current-undergraduates/first-year/mentorship-program</a></p><p><strong>Writing and Communication Centre </strong>- <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/">https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/</a></p>

<h3>
  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
