<p>HLTH 608, <i>Health and Risk Communication in Public Health</i>, is an overview of theories, research findings, and applications of health communication and risk communication in public health. The course examines theories of group interaction and mass communication related to community perceptions of public health problems and practices, the impact of new technologies on public health communication, intercultural issues in health communication, health literacy, social marketing, and links between health communication and public health policy.</p><p><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>: If you have <strong>not</strong> had a course, or equivalent, that addresses health behavior change theories (they are typically presented in depth in courses on health promotion or social, cultural, &amp; behavioural aspects/determinants of health) you will be at a disadvantage and should expect to put in additional time and readings in the initial weeks of the semester. These include the Health Belief Model, Social Cognitive Model, Theory of Reasoned Action/Planned Behaviour, the Transtheoretical Model, and Diffusion of Innovations. We will provide a supplementary module, including recommended reading materials and videos, for students who lack this background or would like a review.</p>

<div>
<h3><strong>Late Assignments</strong></h3><p>Assignments are due as noted on the <a href="https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=205336&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=uWaterloo-461258"><u>Course Schedule</u></a>. <strong>Unless prior arrangements are made, late assignments will lose 10% per late day</strong>.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement</strong></h3><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations</a></p><h3><strong>Land Acknowledgement</strong></h3><p>You may recall land acknowledgement statements in your courses at the University of Waterloo. We typically acknowledge that as students/staff/faculty of the University of Waterloo, we are studying and working on the traditional territory of the Attawandaron (also known as the Neutral), Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes ten kilometres on each side of the Grand River. However, we are participating in this course from diverse traditional territories, and I respectfully recognize the presence of Indigenous peoples, both in the past and present. I recognize the historical and ongoing impacts of colonization, oppressive laws, and broken treaties that have occurred on these lands, and am committed to education, meaningful dialogue, and necessary change. Personally, I am making time to listen, to learn and educate myself, to reflect on the SPHS graduate curriculum and to engage in dialogue with students, faculty and other members of leadership at the university.</p><p>I encourage all course participants to join me in learning about, and acknowledge, the land on which we live and work (e.g., via <a href="https://native-land.ca/"><u>Native Land Digital</u></a>). Creating and using meaningful land acknowledgments may seem challenging and takes time and reflection. For an example and to use as a reference, please see:</p><p>School of Public Health Sciences [SPHS] Land Acknowledgement Template, November 2020. Created by: C. Williams, S. Kirkpatrick, and the SPHHS Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Advisory Group (University of Waterloo).

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
