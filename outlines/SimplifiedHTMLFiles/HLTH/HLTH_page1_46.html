  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>HLTH 706:</div>
<p>Building on HLTH 606, this course provides an in-depth survey of theory and methods in epidemiology, focusing on answering complex research questions using epidemiologic methods.  Course topics include modeling multinomial, count, rate, and survival data and disease transmission; infectious disease dynamics; assessing the reliability/validity of measurement instruments; an in-depth examination of various study designs (e.g., case control, nested case control, case-cohort, randomized controlled trials, panel studies, and hybrid study designs); critical appraisal of the medical literature; and systematic reviews and meta-analysis.</p>

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><h4><strong>Respect</strong></h4><p>Please be respectful of each other. Students are expected to share their informed views and contribute to classroom discussions, but they should not dominate conversation. It is fine to be passionate and highly engaged, though being respectful means allowing others to be heard, no matter how different or even upsetting their views might be. Indeed, university settings champion academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas. During class, you may be exposed to ideas, opinions, and viewpoints that offend you or make you uncomfortable. This is part of attending university and living in a free society. Please maintain respect for other people and their opinions, and they will be expected to treat you with the same curtesy. Do NOT expect to silence other students simply because you disagree with their opinion. They have a right to express their opinion, and so do you.</p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
