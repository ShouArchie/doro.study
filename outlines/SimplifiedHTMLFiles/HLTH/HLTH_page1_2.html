  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>HLTH 102:</div>
<p>This course expands upon the general concepts introduced in HLTH101 while extending the discussion to include issues such as: additional barriers to health; disease prevention; and methods used to plan, monitor, and improve individual and population health. Discussion will include when various interventions are justified and why, and where and when combinations of policies, treatments, education, and other approaches are necessary. The health of Canadians relative to that of people in other countries, as well as the inequalities that exist in health status within Canada and around the globe will be examined. Case examples will be used to illustrate points.</p>

Lectures <i><strong>posted online will not be complete or comprehensive, as you are responsible for attending class (in-person) to fill in the additional material required to make the notes complete</strong></i>.</p><h4><strong>Tutorials</strong></h4><p>The purpose of the tutorial is to provide students with the opportunity to analyze information provided via lecture and readings and ensure that they are able to apply the constructs to new settings, health issues and emerging health problems. They also permit students to practice and receive feedback in their attainment of new skills related to academic writing. Office hours for the tutorials are to be announced by respective tutorial section TA’s in Waterloo Learn.

<h4><strong>Required Reading</strong></h4><p>On average, there will be ~1-2 readings per week. Readings will be primarily from scholarly journals and technical and community reports (there is no mandatory textbook for this class). The course reading list on Learn has direct links to online readings or will list the reference that is searchable through UWaterloo library. Readings are considered preparatory, and hence required. Students are expected to read the listed articles <strong><u>PRIOR</u></strong> to coming to the tutorial or class for which it has been assigned. Tutorials will be set up to provide background and prepare you for the assignment being distributed; thus if materials are read prior to class, students will understand the questions asked on the assignments more thoroughly and be better prepared to ask questions about it.</p>

<p><strong>Exams</strong></p><p>There will be a mid-term and final exam in this course that will include multiple choice and/or true/false questions. These exams are designed to assess comprehension and understanding of the core concepts covered for each course topic, which include both lecture and reading materials. </p><p><strong>Tutorial Assignments</strong></p><p>Students are expected to participate in tutorial discussions and complete tutorial assignments. The assignments are explained in tutorial sessions and their respective due dates are listed in the tutorial schedule section above. All tutorial assignments are individual work. If assignments handed in for credit are deemed to be the result of excessive collaboration, a mark of zero will be awarded.</p><p>There are 4 tutorial assignments for this course, however only the top three assignment grades will count towards a student’s final grade. This allows for flexibility and/or extenuating circumstances that may prevent a student from submitting an assignment during a particular week. For example, students who complete all four assignments will have their lowest assignment grade dropped. For students who miss an assignment or choose not to complete 1 out of the 4 assignments, the missed assignment will automatically be dropped. </p><p><strong>Late Tutorial Assignments without Accommodations, Self-Declaration of Illness or Notice</strong></p><p>All tutorial assignments are due at <strong>9:30am on the day of your scheduled tutorial session </strong>on the dates indicated in the course outline. Assignments are to be submitted to the dropbox via Waterloo Learn.</p><ol><li>Late assignments will be penalized by 10% of the assignment total mark per 24-hour period to a maximum of 5 days. The late penalty begins immediately after 9:31am on the day of your scheduled tutorial session when the assignment is due.</li><li>After the 5-day maximum assignments will not be accepted and a grade of ‘zero’ will be recorded for the assignment.</li></ol><p>Elective arrangements (e.g. travel plans) or heavy workloads are not considered acceptable grounds for variance.</p><p><strong>Tutorial Assignment Grading</strong>  </p><p>Students are required to check Learn regularly for their marks. If there is a concern over a grade, or how it was obtained, students are to seek out their tutorial TA first, within <strong><u>7 days</u></strong> of receiving feedback. After that time, you <i>may not</i> request a re-grade. Students who believe they provided valid answers that have not been addressed by the TA are invited to make a case to the Lead TA (<a href="mailto:hlth102@uwaterloo.ca">hlth102@uwaterloo.ca</a>) <i>after an initial discussion with their own TA</i>. Please note that upon appeal, the Lead TA reserves the right to re-grade any portion of the submitted material. Hence, it is possible that an appeal may result in a lower grade. </p><p><strong>Missed Exams</strong></p><p><strong>Mid-term examination: </strong>In most circumstances, approved accommodations or considerations will either be: writing a make-up mid-term examination during the week of March 3 to 7 (at a time set by the instructor following University regulations); or having the value of your mid-term (25%) assigned to your final exam (which will become worth 60%). In the absence of approved accommodations or considerations, the value of your mid-term (25%) will be assigned to your final exam (which will become worth 60%). </p><p><strong>Final examination: </strong>In most situations, you will need to write a make-up final exam during the registrar-scheduled make-up exam days.</p><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

<h4><strong>Generative AI</strong></h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and outlined on assignment instructions. </p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p><h4><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement </strong></h4><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is coordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p>It is also important to reflect on the fact that we come from diverse traditional territories, and to therefore respectfully recognize the presence of Indigenous peoples, both in the past and present, in the areas you have lived, studied and worked before arriving to Waterloo. We recognize the historical and ongoing impacts of colonization, oppressive laws, and broken treaties that have occurred on these lands. As a part-time Faculty member in the Faculty of Health, I am committed to education, meaningful dialogue, and necessary change. Collectively, we are making time to listen, to learn and educate ourselves and reflect on the SPHS curriculum and to engage in dialogue with students, faculty and other members of leadership at the university. I encourage all course participants to join us in learning about, and acknowledge, the land on which we live and work (e.g., via Native Land Digital, <a href="https://native-land.ca/">https://native-land.ca</a>). </p><h4><strong>Inclusivity Statement</strong></h4><p>The School of Public Health Sciences and the University of Waterloo are committed to supporting our students (please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33">Policy 33</a> for details on ethical behaviour at the University of Waterloo). As instructors, this means creating and sustaining an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment, in the classroom. Our expectations are that in courses, lectures and through various forms of communication between members of this class community, we will engage in respectful and meaningful dialogue in line with course objectives that is free of discrimination and harassment. I value your participation in this process and welcome dialogue or feedback on course facilitation and material that might improve course materials as it relates to equity and inclusion. For more information on the efforts SPHS is taking to ensure equity, diversity and inclusion, please visit <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/public-health-sciences/resources-services/equity-diversity-and-inclusion">SPHS EDI webpage.   </a></p><h4><strong>Anti-racism Statement</strong></h4><p>The University of Waterloo does not tolerate racism or any other form of discrimination and expects campus community members to contribute to a culture where all members feel safe and valued. Any member of the campus community who has experienced racism or discrimination at the University is encouraged to review available processes for addressing their concerns under Policy 33 – Ethical Behaviour and to seek guidance from the Equity Office via email at <a href="mailto:equity@uwaterloo.ca">equity@uwaterloo.ca</a> or through their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/">website</a>. </p><h4><strong>Health and Wellbeing</strong></h4><p>You are a valued part of our community, and I want you to succeed in your academic endeavours. Recognizing that our individual identities shape our experiences in higher education, this means that some of us disproportionately encounter systemic barriers to belonging. Additionally, University life can be difficult with multiple demands. The Faculty of Health is committed and actively working to foster an environment where you belong and can thrive. You may experience stressors that can impact your personal well-being and academic experience, but there are multiple supports and resources available to you on and off-campus. An important resource that you may find helpful for your physical and mental wellbeing is <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">Campus Wellness</a>. If you need to support after regular business hours, you can contact Empower Me at 1-833-628-5589, or Good2Talk at 1-866-925-5454.  </p><h4><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></h4><p>Be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of the instructor, teaching assistant, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof).</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g.,PowerPoint slides).</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or teaching assistant or used by the instructor or teaching assistant with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, teaching assistant and/or University of Waterloo permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g. to an online repository).  </p><p>Permission from an instructor, teaching assistant or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights and academic integrity.</p><p>*NOTE - content in HLTH 102 (winter 2025) is adapted from Dr. Katie Burns and Dr. Scott Leatherdale. </p><h4><strong>Accommodations for Late Assignments, Missed Examinations or Extenuating Circumstances</strong></h4><p><strong><u>Absences declared through Quest </u></strong></p><p><strong>Religious or creed-related absence</strong></p><p>Students can submit a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#religious">Religious Observance Self-Declaration</a> in Quest.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
