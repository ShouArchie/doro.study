<div>
<div>
<div>HLTH 652:</div>
<p>This course explores qualitative method approaches to program evaluation and public health practice. A critical analysis will inform health policy and practice based on methodological approaches most appropriate to the type of evaluation being conducted. Data collection tools, such as focus groups or interviews will be taught, as well as useful techniques for data analysis, interpretation of results, and presentation of findings. Mixed methods are introduced.</p>

<p>HLTH 652 applies qualitative approaches to program evaluation and public health practice within a broader context of mixed method evaluation studies. The course will address epistemological approaches used in qualitative research and provide useful strategies for data collection, analysis and presentation of findings. Students will have the opportunity to carry out and analyze a short piece of qualitative evaluation research, using critical approaches to inform health policy and practice. At the end of the course, students will appreciate how and when to use qualitative research methods and recognize appropriate designs for different evaluation questions.</p>

<p>You can purchase and access your eTextbook within the Course Information module in LEARN.</p><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/services/course-reserves-students">Course reserves for students</a> are used in this course. Course Reserves can be accessed using the <strong>Library Resources</strong> widget on the <strong>Course Home</strong> page in LEARN.</p><p>One of your assignments will require you to conduct and record audio for a 15–20 minute interview. Most cell phones have a "voice memo" or similar tool built-in that will be more than sufficient for the purpose of the assignment. If you do not have a cell phone that can record audio, you will need to borrow, rent, or purchase something that can. Note that the built-in LEARN recording tool allows only 4 minutes of audio to be recorded at a time, which is not sufficient to complete this assignment.</p><p>Email your instructor as soon as possible if you do not think you will be able to find an audio recording device.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
