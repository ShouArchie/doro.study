  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>HLTH 443:</div>
<p>This course introduces the basic methods for communicable disease epidemiology and discusses important infectious diseases, including their history, ecology and current public health significance.  The course focuses on epidemiological methods in infectious disease research, prevention, and control, such as outbreak investigations, disease surveillance, case-control and cohort studies, laboratory tools, molecular epidemiology, dynamics of transmission, and assessment of vaccine field effectiveness.  A range of communicable diseases will be discussed including respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, bloodborne diseases, and vector-borne diseases.</p>

<div>
<h4>Territorial Acknowledgement</h4><p>This course – about how communicable diseases spread and impact populations – is happening on the land traditionally cared for Indigenous Peoples, in a country whose historical and ongoing colonization, oppressive laws, and broken treaties have directly determined who is more protected from, and who is more vulnerable to, communicable diseases. For example, who is well protected from waterborne diseases because they have clean, potable water available for drinking and hand washing, and who is not? In this course, we recognize that colonialism is a determinant of health, and acknowledge the ways it has shaped, and is embedded in, the discipline of epidemiology.  </p><p> </p>

  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Course Structure</h4><p>This course uses a hypothetical ongoing outbreak, to mimic how infectious disease epidemiologists operate in practice and to scaffold the concepts and activities of the course. We will tackle the outbreak in ~10 minute segments each week. You will be invited to use the outbreak to explore important infectious disease concepts, which you will then work through and apply, using a combination of self-study and class discussion/exercises. </p><p>Please see the Detailed Schedule and Outbreak Workbook in LEARN, for the concepts and outbreak segment we will tackle each week.  Please note that we will use class time to explore concepts that are more complex and for which you have questions, and to integrate concepts and apply them to various scenarios.  This means there will be many concepts you will need to study on your own outside of class.  </p><h4>Connection Between HLTH 443 and HLTH 445</h4><p>HLTH 445 ("Pandemic Preparedness") is also happening this term with Dr. Zahid Butt. Dr. Butt and I see great value in connecting the two classes:</p><ul><li>In HLTH 443, you and your peers have the opportunity to become class experts on a large range of pathogens, some of which have pandemic potential. Collectively, your Wanted Posters will showcase this information, and you will have the chance to share your posters with HLTH 445 students, so they can appreciate a fuller range of pathogens than HLTH 445 has time to cover. </li><li>In HLTH 445, students will create things like pandemic plans and case studies for real pandemics. Although HLTH 443 uses a fictional pandemic to scaffold course concepts, we don't delve into pandemics in detail. Thus, towards the end of March, you will have the opportunity to explore items created by HLTH 445 students, and you will be asked to consider them in your Outbreak Reflection. Specific details of what to explore, and how, will be announced during the term.</li></ul><p>If you are taking both classes, and have ideas about how to connect them, feel free to email me. Dr. Butt and I are always interested in fun or novel ways to make connections between the two courses.</p><h4>Updates and Announcements</h4><p>Most announcements will be made in orally class, including:</p><ul><li>schedule changes to classes and office hours</li><li>additional required and reference materials</li><li>answers to common questions including explanations or clarifications about assessments</li></ul><p>If an announcement needs to be made between classes, or in the event of a last-minute cancelled class (e.g., due to illness), I will post an announcement in LEARN.</p><p>Please check LEARN prior to class for any cancellations.</p>

<p>For the materials in the table above, please see LEARN for more details on how/when to access.</p><h4>‘Contagion’ (2011 film)</h4><p>We will move through this movie in class (in English with English subtitles), but you can also (re-)watch the weekly segments on your own via UW’s free ‘Criterion-on-Demand’ streaming service (which offers English audio, Close Captioned, French audio, and French caption options). If you’re off campus, you will first need to log in to your library account.</p><p>This movie is rated PG-13, and contains some medical imagery that may be disturbing (including a gory autopsy), mature themes (death, infidelity), some swearing, and social drinking. If you want more details on this movie’s potentially sensitive content, commonsensemedia.org provides a good overview (with spoilers). </p><h4>Additional Required Readings</h4><p>The world of infectious diseases moves quickly. To capitalize on infectious disease events that occur during the term, and in response to important concepts identified by the class, additional required readings and resources will be identified and assigned during the term. These will be made available electronically via the course LEARN site or eReserves, and will be free.</p>

<h4>Rules for Group Work</h4><p>For the 'Pathogen Project Part 1 - Wanted Poster', you can choose to work individually or in self-selected pairs. If you work as a pair, both of you will receive the same grade.  </p><p>For the 'Pathogen Project Part 2 - Transmission Synthesis', you will work with your classmates on some preparatory work, but the assessment itself must be done individually.   </p><p>For the 'Outbreak Reflection', you will work with your classmates to complete aspects of the Outbreak Workbook in class, but the assessment itself must be done individually.</p><p>For the mid-term and final examinations, you can work with your classmates when mocking up answers to the provided questions, but any materials you bring to the open book examinations must be completely and 100% your own creation, and be all your own thoughts and content. </p><p>Any other collaboration or group work on assessments is not allowed.  If you have questions about specific activities or situations, please email me before submitting the assessment.</p><h4>Handing in and Return of Assessments</h4><p>Please submit the Pathogen Project (Parts 1 and 2) and the Outbreak Reflection electronically via the LEARN Dropboxes.  The Mid-Term and Final Examinations will be written in-person during scheduled time slots, outside of class time. Please see LEARN for due dates and details.  </p><p>Once assessments are graded, grades and feedback will be available in LEARN. The goal is to return assessments within two weeks after their due date, although it may be longer depending on the nature of the submissions, to ensure you are given sufficient feedback to apply to remaining course assessments.  </p><p> </p>

  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<h4>Preferred Names and Pronouns</h4><p>I look forward to getting to know you this term.  In the first week of class, you will be invited to tell me your preferred name and pronouns.</p><h4>Course Values  </h4><p><strong>Universal learning and accessibility</strong></p><p>I value each of you fully participating in, and engaging with, the course and its activities to your fullest.  </p><p>If you have particular accessibility needs, please see <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">University accommodation processes</a>, including options for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/resources/accommodations-racial-trauma">academic accommodations related to traumatic experiences based on race</a>. Once you've registered with these services, they will forward me any required information. Then, we work out the details of any accommodations needed for this course to provide you the opportunity to achieve to your full potential in a way that maintains the academic integrity of the curriculum.</p><p><strong>Caring for ourselves</strong></p><p>This is a course about infectious diseases and their impacts, as we come out of a pandemic, at a time of year when people often get sick. This affords us great opportunities to learn but can also generate great stress. Your health and wellbeing are top priority.  Please take care of your physical and mental health, and bring the utmost respect to your interactions with your peers and with me. Assume everyone is doing their best. Be kind.  Please see LEARN for more details about where to access University supports. </p><p><strong>Mutual respect and the ability to listen to others</strong></p><p>The ability to engage with and value diverse perspectives is an important skill for epidemiologists; for example, it allows us to collect valid data and accurately interpret results. </p><p>In this class, we will debate concepts and how they relate to communicable diseases in populations, including concepts related to human behaviours that can be deeply rooted in culture, ethnicity, religion, gender, and other factors. We won't debate someone's humanity. Please approach our discussions with respect and curiosity. Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic or any other discriminatory remarks are not acceptable. We are all learning and have different lived experiences, so if I ever miss the mark please let me know. I want this class to be an open and welcoming place for us all to learn and grow.</p><p><strong>Positionality</strong></p><p>Each of us has our own intersections and spaces of privilege, that shape how we experience the world, including this class. I will talk about my own positionally further in class. If the concept of positionality is new to you, please review Dr. S.A. Nixon's "The coin model of privilege and critical allyship: implications for health" (BMC Public Health 2019; 19, 1637 - available via eReserves).</p><h4>Late and Missed Assessments, and Accommodations </h4><p>Please see LEARN for details about accommodations, short-term, COVID-19-related, and other types of absences, and the processes to follow in these situations.</p><p><strong>For course assessments that are not exams</strong>, in the absence of approved accommodations or considerations, late submissions will be penalized by 5% of the assessment value per 24-hour period, to a maximum of 5 calendar days, including weekends and holidays. The late penalty begins after the start of the class in which the assessment is due. After the 5 day maximum, submissions will not be accepted and a grade of ‘zero’ will be given for that assessment. In most circumstances, approved accommodations or considerations will be an extension to the deadline by a number of days proportional to the absence, for example, by two days for a short-term absence, or the next day for a religious observance.</p><p><strong>In the event of a missed mid-term examination</strong>, and in the absence of approved accommodations or considerations, the value of your mid-term (30%) will be assigned to your final exam (which will become worth 60%). For the mid-term, in most circumstances approved accommodations or considerations will either be: writing a make-up mid-term examination during the week of March 10 to 14, at a time set by the instructor following University regulations (e.g., the evening of Friday the 14th); or having the value of your mid-term (30%) assigned to your final exam (which will become worth 60%).</p><p><strong>In the event of a missed final examination</strong>, in most situations you will need to write a make-up final exam during the registrar-scheduled make-up exam days.</p><h4>Attendance</h4><p>This course is built around what we do and discuss in class, and classes will deliver content not captured elsewhere (e.g., in-class activities).</p><p>Per the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SyolzIBNT?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Class%20Attendance&amp;bcGroup=Courses%20and%20Classes&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Calendar</a>: </p><ul><li>students are expected to attend all scheduled components of the courses in which they have enrolled;</li><li>during the course Add Period, you may be removed from the course for non-attendance. Students who are removed from a class will be notified by the Office of the Registrar.</li></ul><h4>Grading</h4><p>Please see LEARN for descriptions of how each assessment will be graded. </p><p>If you believe that an error has been made in grading, please email me within one week of the grades being released, with a clear description of the issue. I may regrade some or all of what you submitted.  Your revised mark may go up, down, or stay the same, and the revised grade is final. </p><h4>Academic Integrity</h4><p>You are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic integrity offences, and to take responsibility for your actions.  Please see the University policy, below, on this. If you are concerned about your progress or grade in this course, please come speak with me instead of considering academic misconduct. </p><p>It can be tricky to figure out how rules apply to specific course assessments ("can I copy from an electronic source and paste into my poster if I change some of the words?"; "what if I studied with my classmates and we collaborated to create mock answers - can I use them in the mid-term?"). We will talk about common questions in class, but please ask me any specific questions you have. I want to help you avoid potential offences.</p><h4>Intellectual Property and Copyright </h4><p>Simply put, intellectual property (IP) belongs to the person or people who created it. Please be aware that this course contains my intellectual property, as well as that of other authors, and the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as (but not limited to): lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof); lecture handouts, presentations, other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides, Outbreak Workbook); questions/solutions from various assessments (e.g., assignments, exams); and work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by me or used by me with permission of the copyright owner).</p><p>Please do not upload course materials, including slides, assessments, and exams, on online sharing platforms, such as CourseHero, OneClass and similar platforms - it’s a copyright violation, regardless of whether you did so intentionally or unintentionally. In many cases, I created, and own, the material in question, so if you want to share or distribute course materials, please talk to me first. You may not distribute or reproduce the materials, whether for commercial purposes or not, without my express written consent. Please note that instructors do not waive their intellectual property rights when granting limited use of their course materials to students.</p><h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, <strong>may be used in this course with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement for some, but not all, assessments. Permitted uses of and expectations for using GenAI will discussed in class and are outlined on assessment instructions and grading rubrics. </strong></p><p>Recommendations for how to cite generative AI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: <a href="https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai"><u>https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai</u></a>. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. </p>
