<p><strong><u>DISCUSSION FORUM</u></strong></p><p>Students will independently complete 5 discussion forum assessments (i.e., an initial thread and response) on LEARN over the term. Students are required to complete one thread and one response to a classmate’s thread for each discussion forum assessment. The topics for the discussion forum assessments will vary. Students may be asked to summarize the key points of a lecture or write a short paragraph explaining their view of a particular topic. The goal of the discussion forum is for students to “check-in”; connect with their classmates; and, reflect upon the course content to ensure they understand the material. A rubric for these assessments will be posted on LEARN. </p><p><strong><u>APPLICATION OF THE PICO(ST) FRAMEWORK</u></strong></p><p>This two-part assignment is to be completed using 2 pages (excluding title page and reference list), double-spacing, and 12-point Times New Roman font. You may use a referencing system of your choice (e.g., APA, MLA, Vancouver system, etc.). A rubric will be posted on LEARN.  </p><ol><li>Using the PICO(ST) format, please provide detail on the population (or patient), intervention, comparison, outcome, study design, and time period of a public health issue that interests you using the scientific literature as your guide; and,</li><li>Develop a clear and succinct research question using the PICO(ST) format.</li></ol><p><strong><u>CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW</u></strong></p><p>This assignment is to be completed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) tool for systematic reviews as a guide to critically appraise the following systematic review: </p><p>Nunes, M.C. &amp; Madhi, S.A. (2018). Influenza vaccination during pregnancy for prevention of influenza confirmed illness in the infants: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Human Vaccines &amp; Immunotherapeutics, 14(3), 758–766. </p><p>This systematic review can be uploaded from LEARN or accessed using the following link: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5861794/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5861794/</a>.</p><p>As you have learned in this course, the CASP tool for systematic reviews provides 10 questions to assist you in critically appraising a systematic review. This assignment should include all three sections of the CASP tool including, Section A, “Are the results of the review valid?”; Section B, “What are the results?”; and, Section C, “Will the results help locally?”. </p><p>You have a maximum of 7 pages (excluding title page and reference list), double-spacing, and 12-point Times New Roman font to complete this assignment. You may use a referencing system of your choice (e.g., APA, MLA, Vancouver system etc.). A rubric will be posted on LEARN.  </p><p><strong><u>QUIZ</u></strong></p><p>The quiz includes a total of 20 questions (i.e., multiple choice and multiple selection questions) that are worth 1 point each for a grand total of 20 marks administered through LEARN. This quiz is worth 20% of the final grade. Students will have one attempt to answer the questions which are designed to test student recall and application of important course concepts discussed over the course of the term (i.e., course content including week #s 1 – 11). Students must complete this quiz independently and will be allocated 1 hour of class time for its completion. Students may use any course materials that they wish to answer the questions. Please ensure to have a technological device available to complete the quiz. The quiz will take place <u>in-person </u>during our regularly scheduled class as per the course schedule.</p><p><strong><u>KT REPORT: BRIDGING EVIDENCE AND PRACTICE</u></strong></p><p>In this assignment, students will develop a comprehensive Knowledge Translation (KT) report designed for a specified knowledge user group. The report will translate evidence-based research into actionable strategies, addressing a public health or health care issue. Students will apply the components of the Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) cycle, critically appraise research evidence, and integrate KT strategies tailored to the needs of the intended audience. The KT report is to be 10 pages (excluding title page and reference list), double-spaced, and use of 12-point Times New Roman font. You may use a referencing system of your choice (e.g., APA, MLA, Vancouver system, etc.). A rubric will be posted on LEARN.  </p><p><strong>Choose a Topic and Knowledge User Group</strong><br/>Select a public health or healthcare issue of interest (e.g., vaccine hesitancy, chronic disease management, mental health in youth). Identify a specific knowledge user group (e.g., policymakers, healthcare providers, patients, or community organizations).</p><p><strong>Develop a Research Question Using PICO(ST):</strong><br/>Frame your topic using the PICO(ST) framework to create a focused and actionable research question. </p><p><strong>Search and Critically Appraise Evidence:</strong><br/>Conduct a literature search to identify high-quality research evidence, including systematic reviews, relevant to your research question. Present a summary of the evidence that is relevant to the chosen topic and knowledge user group.</p><p><strong>Apply the Knowledge-to-Action Cycle:</strong><br/>Address the following components in your report:</p><ul><li><strong>Problem Identification and Knowledge Creation:</strong> Summarize the issue and relevant evidence.</li><li><strong>Adapt Knowledge to Context:</strong> Discuss how the evidence applies to the knowledge user group.</li><li><strong>Barriers and Facilitators:</strong> Identify challenges and enablers for knowledge use.</li><li><strong>Implement a KT Strategy:</strong> Propose a KT strategy tailored to the knowledge user group.</li><li><strong>Monitor and Evaluate:</strong> Outline a plan for assessing the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.</li></ul><p><strong>Integrate Technology-Enabled KT Strategies:</strong><br/>Highlight the role of technology (e.g., apps, social media, decision-support tools) in implementing your KT strategies and engaging your target audience.</p><p><strong>References:</strong> </p><p>Provide a list of references for all in-text citations </p><p><strong>KT Product Development (Optional Bonus Component):</strong><br/>Create a KT product (e.g., infographic, patient education tool) tailored to your knowledge user group. Submit this alongside your report for up to 5 bonus marks.</p>

<p><strong><u>Territorial Acknowledgement: </u></strong></p><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is coordinated within the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/indigenous">Office of Indigenous Relations.</a></p><p>For HLTH 435, the following University of Waterloo policies apply at the course-level as per the undergraduate academic calendar: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/policy/SkiPsB9Vp">Assessments: Academic Considerations and Accommodations.</a> </p><p><strong><u>Absences in Quest</u></strong></p><p><u>Religious or creed-related absence</u></p><p>Undergraduate students can now submit a <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#religious">Religious Observance Self-Declaration</a> in Quest. This allows students to register the dates of potential conflict with coursework. As the dates of important religious observances are generally known well in advance, students must consult with their instructors within two weeks of the announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. </p><p><u>Short-term absence</u><strong> </strong>(once/term) </p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#short-term-absence">self-declare</a> <strong><u>one</u> </strong>short-term absence per term on Quest for any reason (no documentation required). A short-term absence covers up to two calendar days during the <i>formal lecture period</i>. Laboratory (LAB), Clinic (CLN), and Studio (STU) courses/class components do not qualify for accommodation as a result of a self-declared short-term absence. There is no expectation that a self-declared short-term absence be total; that is, students may elect to participate in any course and complete any course element(s) despite not being required to. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 24 hours after submitting their self-declaration to discuss accommodations for missed course components.</p><p><u>COVID-19-related absence</u><strong> </strong>(once/term) </p><p>Students can <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/the-centre/quest/quest-undergraduate-students/how-do-i-self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students#covid-19">self-declare</a> an absence of up to 10 days due to COVID-19-related illness. No in-person course activity is permitted during the period of a self-declared COVID absence. Participation in online components is permitted but should not be required if the student notifies the instructor that they are too ill to participate in the online work. Submitting the self-declaration through Quest will notify your instructors of your absence. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their instructors within the first 48 hours after submitting their COVID-related absence, or as soon as they are well enough, to discuss arrangements for missed course components.</p><p><strong><u>Absences Requiring Documentation</u></strong></p><p><u>Absence due to illness</u></p><p>When students are unable to meet academic obligations due to illness, they are required to complete the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances web form</a> (log in required) and upload their <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/students/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/verification-of-illness-form-website-fillable-final_0.pdf">Verification of Illness Form</a> (VIF) to the site. The University of Waterloo Verification of Illness Form (VIF) is normally the only medical documentation accepted to support requests for academic consideration. Students should not submit their VIF or any other medical documentation to their instructors, teaching assistants, or advisors. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able given their health condition. Once approved, the student and their instructors will receive a confirmation email of the student’s absence. Course instructors will determine how missed course components are accommodated. </p><p><u>Absence due to extenuating circumstances</u></p><p>For absences due to extenuating circumstances (bereavement, family illness, varsity sports, etc.), students are required to complete the <a href="https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/">Verification of Illness or Extenuating Circumstances web form</a> (log in required) and upload their official documentation (e.g., plane tickets, court documents, police reports, etc.) to the site. To request and arrange accommodations, it is the student’s responsibility to contact instructors within 48 hours of the date of any missed course component, or as soon as the student is able given their circumstances. </p><p><strong><u>Generative Artificial Intelligence</u></strong></p><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as <strong>[fill this in with your discipline-specific skills]</strong>. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

AccessAbility Services is the University's centralized office for the management of academic accommodations for all students with known or suspected disabilities and disabling conditions (injuries, medical conditions, and impacts of trauma). Students seeking academic accommodations as a result of disability/disabling conditions will <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students/applying-academic-accommodations"><u>register with AccessAbility Services</u></a> to determine eligibility for academic accommodations, and to develop an academic accommodation plan as required. AccessAbility Services will relay the accommodation plan to instructors, and will work with the instructor and the student to ensure an appropriate accommodation plan is implemented. Disability covers a broad range and degree of conditions that can be permanent, temporary, sporadic, and suspected, including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, learning disabilities, developmental disabilities, mental health disabilities, medical conditions, and the physical, emotional, and psychological effects of trauma (e.g., sexual violence, discrimination, or oppression).</p><p>Refer to the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/student-academic-accommodation-guidelines"><u>Student Academic Accommodation Guidelines</u></a> for more information on eligibility for academic accommodations, the process for registering with AccessAbility Services, and for information on roles and responsibilities in the accommodation process.</p><p><strong><u>Academic Accommodations Due to Creed/Religion</u></strong></p><p>The University acknowledges that, due to the pluralistic nature of the University community, some students may seek academic accommodations on religious grounds.</p><p>Students can complete the Religious Observance Self-Declaration Form in Quest, which will inform their instructors of the potential conflict for certain dates. As the dates of important religious observances are generally known well in advance, students must consult with their instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date or scheduled examination date for which academic accommodation is being sought. The self-declaration form for short-term absences may also be used by students requiring an absence of two days or less during the Formal Lecture Period.</p><p><strong><u>Academic Accommodations due to Other Code Grounds</u></strong></p><p>Students seeking an academic accommodation related to a protected ground (e.g., creed, family status, and sex, including pregnancy and breastfeeding) should inform their instructor/academic unit as soon as they become aware of the need.</p><p><strong><u>Slips Days</u></strong></p><p>To confirm, there are <strong><u>no</u></strong> 'slip days' provided in HLTH 435. Please review the above following options that are supported by university-level policy in the event that you would like to request a variance. In order to ensure student equity, <u>all requested variances at the course-level must be supported and guided by a university-approved policy</u>. Thank you. </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
