<p>In this course, we will learn about the theory and practice of health promotion. The course is divided into two parts. During the first part of the course, you will be introduced to the history, theories, and models of health promotion. You will learn about individual, social and critical approaches to improving population health. The second part of the course will give you an opportunity to apply theory to practice – you will be working in groups to design and implement your own health promotion initiative.</p><h3> </h3><p> </p>

<h3>Quizzes (10% each, total of 40%)</h3><h3>Why do we need to use quizzes as an assessment? </h3><p>This course is designed to expose you to new knowledge. Some of this knowledge is important to memorize. For instance, you would need to remember the key concepts from Health Belief Model or Stages of Change theory. However, most of what we will be learning about is not focused on memorization, but on your understanding of health promotion theory and practice. </p><p>Quizzes are an effective way to evaluate this knowledge in a somewhat objective manner. I can ask you questions that test your understanding of the readings, lectures, and class discussions, and assess your level of comprehension in relation to that of your peers. Moreover, quizzes also help me to see if I did my job right: If I see that some of the questions were not answered correctly by most students, it means I need to better explain this topic and/or modify a question. This is why quizzes are an effective way for us all to understand how we progress with the learned material. </p><h3>How quizzes will be structured? </h3><p>We will have a total of 4 quizzes throughout the term, each covering roughly 3 weeks of the course material. All quizzes will include 30 multiple choice questions, which will be based on readings, lectures, videos, and class discussions. You will have 40 minutes to complete the quiz. The quizzes will be administered on LEARN. To help you manage your multiple responsibilities, I will give you 48-hour window during which the quiz will be available. Quizzes will be “open-book”, but I expect you to do them individually and not collaborate with your peers when answering the questions. Each quiz will have a weight of 10% of the final grade for a total of 40%.</p><h3>What if you miss a quiz or do poorly on one of the quizzes?</h3><p>Life happens and sometimes our performance might be negatively impacted by what is happening in our personal lives. If this occurs in your case, you can consider writing a “bonus” quiz. I offer it as an option (you do not have to do it!) for those who either missed a quiz or would like to improve their quiz grade. The bonus quiz will be offered at the end of the term and will be cumulative, covering all the material for the term. It will also have 30 multiple choice questions and will be worth 10% of your final mark. If you write a bonus quiz, it will only replace your mark for any of the quizzes if you got a higher grade on the bonus quiz. If you tried it and did not do as well as you hoped, it would not affect your grade. </p><h3>What if you struggle with quizzes?</h3><p>I grew up in an education system where oral examination and open-ended questions were the norm. Facing multiple choice questions for the first time at university, I struggled a lot with understanding how to answer them properly. Eventually, I managed to find my own “system” of doing multiple choice questions. If you feel that you might need support, reach out to me, and I will share with you some of the strategies I found helpful. </p><h3>Class Engagement (25%)</h3><h3>Why do we have class engagement as an assessment? </h3><p>I believe that the best way to learn is to think about the content and apply it to your own experiences. I designed engagement activities to help you apply the theories that we learn. Engaging with the material this way will also help you to retain it and feel more prepared for the quiz. For me,  engagement activities can help to “check-in” with the class and identify any topics or concepts that may need to be explained again.  </p><h3>How engagement activities will be structured?</h3><p>In this class, we will be learning to apply health promotion theory. While I will not be taking attendance, I built this course with an expectation that you will attend classes. This is because attending classes would be the best way for you to learn. Each week, we will be working on a case study or another engagement activity to deepen your understanding of the learned material. You will be working in groups and submit your work for evaluation. Each engagement activity would count as 2.5% of your grade for a total of 25% (10 activities per term).  </p><h3>What if you missed an engagement activity and/or missed a class?  </h3><p>I appreciate that students have many different roles and responsibilities and that sometimes you may need to miss classes due to illness or personal circumstances. You will have one bonus activity to replace any missed engagement activity during the term.   </p><h3>Group Project (35%)</h3><h3>Why do we need a group project? </h3><p>I want this course to be relevant to your future careers and to your personal lives. Therefore, I want you to experiment with the knowledge you gain in this class, to practice its application and extend your learning beyond the material we cover in this course. Working on the group project, you will be able to demonstrate your knowledge of the learned material, to show your creativity, and to do a meaningful change in your community.  </p><h3>How the group project will be structured? </h3><p>In the groups of 3-4 students, you will develop and implement a health promotion project. You will have a chance to discuss your ideas with your classmates and to form your own groups.  </p><p>Some of the examples of what you can do include community outreach, developing an infographic or other promotional material, doing a video, creating an awareness campaign, or organizing a fundraising. Working on your project, you need to utilize one of the theories or models we studied in class.  More details on the project are provided below.</p><h3>Are you worrying about the group project? </h3><p>While learning to speak in public and collaborate with others are important skills for public health professionals, some students might feel anxious about working with others or public speaking. If you are worried about group work, please reach out to your instructor - I can provide you with some strategies that can help you to feel more confident about group work and/or public speaking.  </p><h3>PROJECT DELIVERABLES AND DUE DATES:  </h3><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Deliverable </strong></td><td><strong>Due date  </strong></td><td><strong>Details/notes </strong></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Group contract </strong></p><p><strong>(no mark assigned) </strong></p></td><td>Jan 24 @ 11:59 pm  </td><td><p>You can form your own groups.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as communicating with diverse audiences, problem-solving, and resourcefulness. Therefore, the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.
