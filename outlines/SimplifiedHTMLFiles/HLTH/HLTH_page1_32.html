(Completed individually.)</li></ul><p><i>On the second Friday of a module:</i></p><ul><li>Your team’s case solution is due. The module ends.</li></ul><p>This pattern repeats starting on the next Monday. The result is you usually get a short Sat/Sun “break” between modules.  Please note, Modules 1 and 6 are only one week in length and do not contain the same set of deliverables as Modules 2 through 5.  While Module 7 is two weeks, it only requires a team case solution. </p><p><i><strong>Deliverables are always due at midnight EST. </strong></i></p><p>LEARN is stern with cutoff times and therefore give yourself some slack. If you try to submit at 23h59 EST you can easily find LEARN denying the submission should the clock strike midnight while the upload is happening. Don’t wait until the very last minute and submit well before the deadline to avoid any issues. </p><p>Special Notes Regarding Dates</p><p><strong>The dates and times noted in this document serve as the official notice of due dates.</strong> Only a change posted via the HLTH609 ANNOUNCE­MENTS feature in LEARN will overrule a due date in this document. Any official change will be posted to the ANNOUNCE­MENTS feature. I will also do my best to use the course LEARN calendar in addition to key dates within the “Start Here” pages. </p><p>Given past experience, the convenience of having dates appear in multiple locations comes with a caveat, that being that the course outline dates prevail.  Accordingly, please carefully review the due dates and the course rhythm described in this document. </p><p>There is one due date that doesn’t follow the normal course rhythm of due dates. Well in advance of Module 7, you must write a personal MyCase.  <i><strong>Your MyCase is due Monday February 24<sup>th</sup>.</strong></i></p><p>You can find more about the MyCase activity in the Module 7 folder in LEARN. <i><strong>The Module 7 folder is available from the first day of the term.   Look now!</strong></i>  Often people forget that a Module 7 task that is due well before Module 7 starts. </p><p> </p>

<p><strong><u>Root Cause Problem Statements (25%) </u></strong></p><ul><li>5 individual submissions. </li></ul><p>Modules 2 through 6 begin with reading a case that you download from HBR. The case presents a scenario that usually concludes with a critical inci­dent or the need to make a decision.  Your task is to <strong>identify the underlying root cause problem that has placed the organization in the predi­cament it faces and to </strong><i><strong>explain</strong></i><strong> </strong><i><strong>why</strong></i><strong> you believe this is the root cause problem </strong><u>using evidence from the case to support your reasoning.</u> </p><p>A handout titled <i>Crafting a Root Cause Problem Statement</i> can be found under CONTENT &gt;&gt; BACKGROUND MATER­IALS.  <strong>Be sure to review this before writing your first root cause problem statement. </strong>When completed, upload your root cause problem statements to your TA’s dropbox. </p><p>Please provide a Microsoft Word file (No PDF please) in the drop box and follow the file naming con­vention described in the <i>Crafting a Root Cause Problem Statement</i> handout. </p><p><strong><u>Case Solutions (30%)</u></strong></p><ul><li><strong>5 group submissions</strong></li></ul><p>Your group spends the second week of most modules addressing the root cause problem in the case<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> with a recommended course of action that would solve the problem.</p><p>Your solution should be prescriptive and action oriented. What does the organization need to do?  When, why and how do they need to take these steps? It is important to support your recom­mended solution with reasoning (evidence) drawn from the case or con­temporary manage­ment think­ing/lit­erature. </p><p>A handout named <i>Crafting a Case Solution</i> can be found under CONTENT &gt;&gt; BACKGROUND MATER­­IALS.  Read this handout before tackling your first group case solution. </p><p>When completed, upload your case solution to your group’s dropbox.  Please provide a Microsoft Word file (No PDF please) and follow the file naming con­v­ention described on the <i>Crafting a Case Solution</i> handout. </p><p><strong><u>The MyCase Activity (25%)</u></strong></p><ul><li><strong>1 individual submission</strong></li></ul><p><strong>NOTE: There is a MyCase deliverable that occurs during Module 4.  Read the Module 7 page in LEARN <u>at the start of the term</u> so you know what to do.</strong></p><p>For the MyCase activity you have a chance to apply the theories and concepts you’ve been reviewing in class to a management challenge you are exper­iencing, have experienced, or hope never to experience, by writing your own case study. </p><p>Details to guide you in writing your MyCase can be found in LEARN under Module 7. Wait until you have read and solved a few cases before starting to create your MyCase. This is because there is a style to cases that you will want to incorporate into your MyCase. However, it is never too early to start thinking about a sticky management or leadership problem that could form the nucleus of your MyCase and it is never too early to go and read the directions under Module 7, so you know what is expected.  Myself and the TA’s will select one case from all those submitted and, with the permission of the selected MyCase, it will then be distributed to the class for Module 7. </p><p><strong>If your MyCase is selected as the case for Module 7, you automatically get 100% for this deliverable.</strong> </p><p><strong>Please note that there is no individual root cause problem state­ment submission required in Module 7.</strong> However, your group will need to decide on what the root cause problem is before tackling preparing your solution.</p><p>There are some special rules that will apply so that your group doesn’t have an unfair advantage when crafting their recommended solution if you happen to have the student who wrote the winning My­Case in your group.  More to follow on this once the MyCase selection is made for that group.</p><p>Submit your MyCase in Microsoft Word in order so that I can work with you to edit your case if it is selected as the MyCase for the class.</p><p><strong><u>Module Reflections (20%)</u></strong></p><ul><li><strong>5 individual submissions</strong></li></ul><p>After each module you are asked to share what you thought were the key learnings from the module and reflect on practical applications you might see for those learnings in your career.</p><p>The Module Reflec­tions task appear under QUIZZES in LEARN.  ‘Reflections’ are <u>not</u> a ‘quiz.’ The Quiz function is simply an easy way to track who has completed the activity and provides an efficient way to provide feedback. </p><p>Each reflection will be read and assessed. There are no “right” or “wrong” answers for the Module Reflection activity.  However, feedback will be provided if reflections seem superficial or aren’t related to the issues being explored. </p><p>Reflections for a module must be submitted by midnight on the Monday of the following module. Your Reflection should be succinct. Just a few sentences in response to the questions I ask you to reflect upon is usually sufficient. </p><p><strong><u>A comment on how assessment works in HLTH609</u></strong></p><p>The objectives of the written submissions are to help you: </p><p>a)  perfect the technique of finding root cause problems.</p><p>b)  identify effective solutions to perplexing management problems; and </p><p>c)  present information effectively for con­sumption by man­agers. </p><p>Some in the class might discover in their first submission that they identified a symptom of the problem instead of the root cause problem. Or maybe the position taken wasn’t supported by evidence (e.g., there was no explicit linking between the root cause problem chosen and the facts in the case.) These factors would impact the score awarded.   Specific coaching will be provided to help with your next submission. Incorporate the ideas provided. In previous years, with incorporation of feedback provided, increased scores are often observed and thus, if your scores are consistently low, or are trending downwards, please reach out so we can review what is happening and can provide some addi­tional coaching. </p><p><strong><u>Locating Scores and Feedback</u></strong></p><p>The Gradebook feature in LEARN <i>is not used</i> in this course. Instead, you will find feedback left in your personal dropbox for problem state­ments, or in your group dropbox for case solutions.   </p><p>Feedback on Reflection submissions can be found under QUIZZES. </p><p>The evaluation of your MyCase will be added to your personal dropbox. </p><p>Live Classes</p><p><strong>Live face-to-face class sessions are held for most modules. </strong>If live classes are held, they are done so on a Tuesday evening of each module. During this session you will be able to talk about the previous case. Comments on the upcoming case are provided in addition to thoughts on relevant theories or concepts. </p><p>We will use Bongo for our live classes.  You can join a live class (or view a recording) by clicking CONNECT followed by clicking VIRTUAL CLASSROOM and selecting the appropriate date to join active meeting or view the recording of the session.</p><p>Our online class lasts approximately an hour. Attendance is optional (as is attending any class at university) but the hope is that you will find these face-to-face sessions a valuable addition to the course. </p><p>Classes are always recorded so those who can’t join us are able to watch at a later time at their leisure. <br/> </p><p> </p>

Instead, your <strong>written sub­missions should employ a business writing style.</strong> Grammatically correct point form is fine when appropriate. Short, concise sentences are welcomed. </p><p>You will also note that I don’t specify particular fonts or sizes, page margins, line spacing, page layouts, etc. for submissions. I will leave it to you (just as your employer will do) to make decisions regarding how you wish to present your recom­men­­dations in a professional manner. Presen­tation style is assessed and thus, if you<strong> </strong>choose a small font that is hard to read on a piece of paper, then this will be addressed as a part of the presentation part of the papers review. As such, please respect the page limits.</p><p>You can use any convention you wish when citing sources. (APA, Chicago, or even something you’ve created yourself, etc.) The only criteria is  that you provide sufficient information to be able to locate the source should we wish to do so. When referencing a fact from the case in a submission, you can simply say something like [Case, pg3].  (Title, author, etc. are not needed.)   </p><p><strong><u>Publishing Course Content</u></strong></p><p>This course contains the intellectual property of your instructor, TAs, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:</p><ul><li>Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof).</li><li>Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides).</li><li>Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and</li><li>Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TAs or used by the instructor or TAs with permission of the copyright owner).</li></ul><p>Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein, are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, <i><strong>sharing intel­lectual property without the intellectual pro­perty owner’s permission is a violation of intel­lectual property rights and is illegal</strong></i><strong>.  </strong>For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TAs and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).</p><p>Permission from an instructor, TAs or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instruc­tors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials.  However, doing so without expressed permission is a violation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online. The intellectual property rights owner deserves to know (and may have already given their consent).</p><p>Welcome to the class and best wishes for the upcoming semester.  Please do connect with the course lead with any comments or questions. </p><p> </p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
