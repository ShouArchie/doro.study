<p><strong>Course Design</strong></p><p>Our HLTH-341 course for Winter 2025 will be a flipped course. All lectures will be pre-posted as power-point slides with accompanying screencasts (i.e., videos). The power-point slides and videos will cover important content and follow along with the posted textbook readings. With our flipped course design, it is expected that students will cover course content in the posted slides and videos independently and on their own during our Monday at 8:30am class time. Student in-person attendance is not required. I will be fully available to all of you during that time. During our Wednesday at 8:30am class time together, we will meet on-campus and in-person all together to go over the content, review major concepts, work through questions, and students can apply understanding through case studies. For our Wednesday class time together, some additional, non-textbook, readings may be posted as interesting articles or articles for some discussion. Other resources may also be provided throughout the term to facilitate student learning. The in-person, on-campus, class time will not be recorded. Students that are unable to attend class can utilize the power-point slides, textbook and other readings, as well as course website, and their peers to supplement anything that was missed. This course design is intended to encourage and promote student engagement and active learning with the goal to move students away from memorization. </p><p><strong>Participation and Engagement </strong></p><p>Participation points will be based on your attendance and participation in our clicker or poll questions during our class time. There will be many opportunities to earn these points. The poll questions will be content-based multiple choice, or other short-response, questions. Students are not required to answer the question correctly since points are awarded simply for attending, participating, and attempting the question. If you miss a class or miss answering questions, that is okay as there is no penalty. You are only required to attend and participate in nine of the twelve Wednesday classes to receive full points. </p><p><strong>Concept Quizzes  </strong></p><p>Students will be assessed on their knowledge and comprehension of course content through a series of concept quizzes. The content covered on each Quiz will be approximately 1 to 2 Modules of course content. Questions will focus on the content covered in the Lectures and Module content with content from the readings designed to supplement student understanding. The online quizzes will be administered through the course website. Students are expected to abide by the honor system to complete these quizzes independently and without any resources. The purpose of these quizzes is for students to ‘self-check’ their understanding of the material that was covered during the class sessions. Questions will predominantly be in the format of Multiple-Choice, or other Quick answer questions. There will not be any written or essay questions. Quizzes will open on the date specified in the course schedule and remain open for 48-hours with due dates at the end of the week on Friday by 11:59pm. Students can complete the quiz at any point during that time-period.   </p><p><strong>Written Assessments</strong></p><p>For detailed guidelines, information, formatting, and rubrics for each of the written assessments, please visit our LEARN course website. Written assessments are designed to allow students to demonstrate their learnings from the course content. Assignments must be submitted electronically by 11:55pm EST on the due date via dropbox submission on the course website.  Assignments must be completed in an accessible file format, such as .docx.  All work must be completed independently and individually. Sources must be cited in APA-7<sup>th</sup> Edition format.</p><p><strong>Due Dates, Dropboxes and Late Submissions</strong></p><p>All written assessments that require submission via a dropbox will have a 48-grace period for submission. </p><p><strong>Marks and Grades</strong></p><p>Questions or concerns regarding marks for any component of the course, must be addressed with your TA within 7-days of the posted mark. After that time, assignment re-marking is not permitted. When requesting re-marking, students are required to clearly outline and explain their request in writing with rationale and support for the request. It is not sufficient to simply say: “I feel I deserve the marks”. Provide supportive evidence of where and why marks were erroneously deducted.</p><p>Grades are based on the <a href="http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Grades">University of Waterloo Grading Scale</a>. All final marks are automatically rounded-up by LEARN to the next highest point (i.e. 69.5% to 70%). </p><h3> </h3><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.
</p>
<a></a>
<h2>
  Notice of Recording
</h2>
<div>
<p>Our in-person and on-campus lectures will be live and in-person without being recorded. Audio and video recording of lectures is strictly prohibited. This will allow for a more natural and dynamic learning atmosphere with a welcome environment for student comments, questions, and participation. In the event that activities for this course may involve recording, in partial fulfillment of the course learning outcomes, you will receive notification of recording via at least one of the following mechanisms: within the Learning Management System (LEARN), a message from your course instructor, course syllabus/website, or other means. Some technologies may also provide a recording indicator. Images, audio, text/chat messaging that may have been recorded may be used and/or made available by the University to HLTH-341 undergraduate students enrolled in our course for the purpose of reviewing course content. Recordings will be managed according to the University records classification scheme, <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/records-management/records-classification-and-retention-schedules"><u>WatClass</u></a>, and will be securely destroyed when no longer needed by the University. Your personal information is protected in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31"><u>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</u></a>, as well as <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/privacy"><u>University policies and guidelines</u></a> and may be subject to disclosure where required by law.</p><p>The University will use reasonable means to protect the security and confidentiality of the recorded information, but cannot provide a guarantee of such due to factors beyond the University’s control, such as recordings being forwarded, copied, intercepted, circulated, disclosed, or stored without the University’s knowledge or permission or the introduction of malware into computer system which could potentially damage or disrupt the computer, networks, and security settings. The University is not responsible for connectivity/technical difficulties or loss of data associated with your hardware, software or Internet connection.</p><p>By engaging in course activities that involve recording, you are consenting to the use of your appearance, image, text/chat messaging, and voice and/or likeness in the manner and under the conditions specified herein. (In the case of a live stream event, if you choose not to have your image or audio recorded, you may <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-it-services/"><u>disable the audio and video functionality</u></a> (see: <i>Student privacy during live events</i>). Instructions to participate using a pseudonym instead of your real name are included where the feature exists; however, you must disclose the pseudonym to your instructor in advance in order to facilitate class participation.) If you choose not to be recorded, this notice serves as confirmation of your understanding that all recordings will be posted to Learn for students to review as needed.</p><p>You are not permitted to disclose the link to/URL of an event or an event session recording or copies of recording to anyone, for any reason. Recordings are available only to authorized individuals who have been directly provided the above instructions/link for their use. Recordings for personal use, required to facilitate your learning and preparation of personal course/lecture notes, should not be shared with others without the permission of the instructor or event coordinator. Review the University’s <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/faculty-staff-and-students-entering-relationships-external"><u>guidelines for faculty, staff and students entering relationships with external organizations offering access to course materials</u></a> for more information on your obligations with respect to keeping copies of course materials.

<h4>Generative AI</h4><p>Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot in teaching, learning, and education is still evolving and changing. In our class, we will discuss the expectations surrounding gen-AI.</p><p>Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a> (plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance). Work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.). </p><p>You should be prepared to show your work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document. If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or TA to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>Students are encouraged to reach out to campus supports if they need help with their coursework including: </p><ul><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/student-success/resources"><u>Student Success Office</u></a> for help with skills like notetaking and time management</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/writing-and-communication-centre/services-0/services-undergraduate-students"><u>Writing and Communication Centre</u></a> for assignments with writing or presentations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students"><u>AccessAbility Services</u></a> for documented accommodations</li><li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/library/research-supports/quick-start-guide"><u>Library</u></a> for research-based assignments</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement</strong></p><p>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River.

  University Policy
</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
