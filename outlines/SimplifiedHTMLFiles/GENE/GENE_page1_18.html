<h4>Course Assessments, Un-grading Approaches, and Holistic Final Grades. </h4><p>GENE 499 has been designed to both build and benefit from a learning community. The expectation is that everyone attends and participates, as they can, in all scheduled course sessions. We want everyone, including the mentors, to focus on overall learning and personal development. Focusing on (numeric) grades for individual deliverables tends to limit students and mentors rather than freeing us to explore and be creative. An additional downside of grading individual deliverables is that a final grade summed from individual components may not reflect the holistic development of the individual and/or their contribution to growth and support within the learning community. Based on previous iterations of similar courses, we have found that most students benefit from a supportive feedback-only approach to early deliverables with a holistic grade assigned at the end of the course. </p><h4>How Holistic Grading Works in GENE 499. </h4><p>To keep the course moving forward, we have deliverables and due dates (See Course Deliverable Table below). You will get support and constructive feedback throughout the term from the mentors and peers.   At the end of the term, the mentors will review all of your deliverables and decide on a holistic course grade for the course. The final grade will be out of 100, as numerical grades are required for Faculty of Engineering courses. You are welcome to discuss your progress throughout the term with one or both mentors and will have an opportunity to discuss your course grade before final grades are submitted to the Registrar’s Office. </p><p>[See GENE 499 Holistic Grading Consideration Rubric posted in LEARN.]</p><h4>GENE 499 Course "Submit in Good Faith" Policy to avoid "0" for late deliverables.</h4><p>Rather than risking a 0 for a late submission, all students are encouraged to upload whatever they have completed on a deliverable by the specified deadline. This allows the instructor opportunity to take extenuating circumstances into consideration and/or grade "as is" (for part marks rather than 0).  </p><h4>Academic Integrity Individual vs Collaborative Assessments.</h4><p>All students are expected to work individually and submit their own original work, except for those assessments clearly indicated as collaborative by the instructors. Under Policy 71, the instructor may have follow-up conversations with individual students to ensure that the work submitted was completed on their own. </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Text matching software (Turnitin) may be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all material and sources in assignments is documented. In the first week of the term, details will be provided about the arrangements for the use of Turnitin and alternatives in this course. See Administrative Policy below for more information and links.

SVPRO can be contacted at <a href="mailto:svpro@uwaterloo.ca"><u>svpro@uwaterloo.ca</u></a></p><p><strong>Religious &amp; Spiritual Observances: </strong>The University of Waterloo has a duty to accommodate religious and spiritual observances under the Ontario Human Rights Code. Please inform the instructor at the beginning of term if special accommodation needs to be made for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and assignments. Consult with your instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought. </p><p><strong>Respectful Communication and Pronouns. </strong>Communications with Instructor(s) and TAs should be through recommended channels for the course (e.g., email, LEARN, Piazza, Teams, etc.) Please use your UW email address. Include an academic signature with your full name, program, student ID. We encourage you to include your pronouns to facilitate respectful communication (e.g., he/him; she/her; they/them).

<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
